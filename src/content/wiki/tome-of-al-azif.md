## Description

The Tome of Al Azif is a grimoire of dark magic recovered from the Underdark. Its pages contain forbidden spells and knowledge that carry a terrible cost — exposure to the tome corrupts the reader's mind and soul.

## Properties

The tome teaches powerful but dangerous spells, including the spell Torture. Reading it provides immense magical knowledge at the price of moral and spiritual corruption.

## History

Fëanon studies the Tome of Al Azif despite warnings about its corrupting influence. The dark knowledge it imparts contributes to changes in the wizard's character and abilities, representing one of the campaign's key moral dilemmas about the price of power.
