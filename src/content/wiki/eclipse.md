---

Eclipse is Patches' signature weapon — a sentient blade made of liquid mercury that responds to her will. Over the course of the campaign, the weapon evolves and is ultimately transformed into a divine crossbow blessed by Elistraee.

The weapon's sentient nature and its connection to both Patches' Drow heritage and the goddess Elistraee make it more than mere equipment — it is a reflection of Patches' own journey from paranoid survivalist to someone capable of embracing a higher calling.
