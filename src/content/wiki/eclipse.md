description: "Patches' sentient obsidian blade of Eilistraee, born from the destruction of the Reaver in a moonlit cleansing ritual."
---

Eclipse is Patches' signature weapon — a sentient blade of glittering obsidian formed from liquid mercury during the cleansing ritual that destroyed the Reaver. Over the course of the campaign, the weapon evolves and is ultimately transformed into a divine crossbow blessed by Eilistraee.

## Origin

When Patches shattered the last hag's tooth upon the cursed Reaver atop the altar in the ruined Temple of Helm in Sundabar, the dagger's fragments melted into a pool of mercury. The liquid metal shaped itself into a levitating disk that bathed Patches in light as she was drawn to it. Her hair lengthened, her form became more lithe, and she reached into the liquid metal up to her shoulder to draw out an obsidian blade that solidified in her grip. Her skin and eyes shone with a rich lustre as she floated gently back to the ground — now bound to Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden, through the weapon.

## Abilities

Eclipse responds to Patches' will, manifesting as a rush of liquid mercury when summoned. The blade is heavily enchanted and capable of cutting through materials that defeat ordinary weapons — including glassteel cases, which Patches discovered during a gem heist in Silverymoon. The weapon's sentient nature and its connection to both Patches' Drow heritage and the goddess Eilistraee make it more than mere equipment — it is a reflection of Patches' own journey from paranoid survivalist to someone capable of embracing a higher calling.
