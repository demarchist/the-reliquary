Horatio Von Bumidere, commonly known as Buumi, is a Human male Paladin and a member of the Faerûn Defense Force. He serves as Captain of the City Guard within the Barony of Thunder Bluff.

## Appearance

Buumi is a tall, strong, and handsome man with piercing blue eyes, a bold shock of red hair, and an elaborate mustache. His many years of martial campaigning have left his arms strong and his hands calloused. He is popular with ladies.

## Personality

Buumi has a loud and boisterous demeanor, but is well-educated and an eloquent speaker beneath it. He is a skilled diplomat and negotiator who often uses his charm and intelligence to persuade others. As the scion of a noble family — though his parents died tragically some time ago — he carries himself with a natural authority.

## Oath and Faith

As a Paladin, Buumi derives his power from the divine but is not a devout follower of any particular god. Rather, he has sworn a powerful oath to come to the defense of those who call for it and aligns himself with whatever deity champions that calling.

## The City Guard

Buumi takes his duties as Captain of the City Guard seriously, always on the lookout for threats to the city and its people. He is a respected and well-liked leader whose men and women trust and follow him without question.

## Secret

In his youth, Buumi was fascinated by stories of dragon knights and their powerful mounts. As he grew older, he realized his attraction to dragons was more than mere fascination. These feelings were not widely accepted, so he has tried to suppress them, though they continue to haunt him and he struggles with feelings of shame and isolation.
