Horatio Von Bumidere, commonly known as Buumi, is a Human male Paladin and a founding member of the Spellforged Adventuring Company. He serves as Captain of the City Guard within the Barony of Thunder Bluff and is the nephew of [[Lord Neverember]], ruler of Neverwinter. Loud, warm, perpetually half-drunk, and fiercely protective of those he loves, Buumi is a man whose boisterous exterior conceals a depth of guilt, faith, and quiet devotion.

## Appearance

Buumi is a tall, strong, and handsome man with piercing blue eyes, a bold shock of red hair, and an elaborate mustache. His many years of martial campaigning have left his arms strong and his hands calloused. He favors heavy armor and has upgraded his equipment steadily over the campaign — from standard plate to a magical shield and half-plate, purchased from [[Sha'Alazzi]]'s Emporium at the Refounding Festival. Without the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength and his magical belt, he is, by his own admission, "quite out of shape."

## Personality

Buumi is a man of contradictions — boisterous and loud on the surface, but well-educated and eloquent beneath the bluster. He is a skilled diplomat and negotiator who often uses his charm and intelligence to persuade others. As the scion of a noble family, he carries himself with natural authority. He is also fond of drink. He showed up to the Refounding Festival hungover, wandered back to the group with a large flagon of ale during the festival events, drank an entire carafe of whiskey before a diplomatic meeting, and was once coerced into the Tavern of Doors so drunk that he crashed down the stairs and was snoring within seconds.

Yet his warmth is genuine. He wasted no time getting to know the locals at every stop, provided background on Neverwinter for the group as a native of the city, blessed [[Tarkathee Daru|Tark]] and [[Lothli]] before their tournament bouts, and healed a goblin with lay on hands moments after Tark accidentally killed it — showing immediate compassion even in the chaos of combat.

## The Paladin's Oath

Buumi is a Watcher of Helm — a paladin whose oath is rooted in guardianship, protection, and justice. He derives his power from the divine but is not a devout follower of any single god, instead aligning himself with whatever deity champions the defense of the innocent. His lay on hands and poison neutralization have saved the group on multiple occasions — he healed [[Myria Brightlance]]'s spider venom in the Chasm, cured Lothli's poisoned crossbow wound after the dockside assassin attack, and quietly touched each party member to neutralize [[Lo'Dan]]'s poison at the Moonstone Mask before they even knew he had acted.

His faith was tested most profoundly when the group was stranded on the alien world of Gaia, cut off from the gods entirely. While [[Cirrus Al Kayan|Cirrus]] panicked at the loss of her connection to Selune, Buumi provided spiritual counsel — theorizing that gods are transcendent, that they embody facts of the universe, and that Helm must exist on this world under a different name. His devotion to protecting others, he argued, was worship in itself. The moment revealed a philosophical maturity that his drinking companions might never have suspected.

## The Gauntlets of Ogre Strength

Buumi wears the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength, recovered from a dead dwarf lord in Wave Echo Cave. His relationship with them is a recurring source of comedy and carnage. When a drunk lord at the festival challenged all comers with his rapier, Buumi staggered forward — very drunk himself — and punched the man square in the face, forgetting about the gauntlets. Bone crunched. The lord dropped. Buumi then high-fived Tark and knocked the halfling to the ground.

## Cercei

Buumi's most unexpected role is that of father — to a dragon. Cercei is a chromatic dragon hatchling who came into Buumi's care, and his love for her is immediate and fierce. He gave her his Ring of Warmth to keep her cozy in cold weather, stuffed her pillow with coins thinking a dragon would appreciate such things, and attempted — with varying success — to teach her table manners, pointing to [[Fëanon Sërindë|Fëanon]]'s perfect etiquette as the model to follow.

Yet the joy of fatherhood is shadowed by dread. Buumi became deeply emotional upon realizing that his dragon daughter will outlive him and all his shorter-lived companions. More troubling still is the knowledge that chromatic dragons tend toward evil — a fate he desperately hopes to avert. He has asked the group whether it is possible to save her from that destiny, and the consensus — in a world where they have fought liches, travelled across dimensions, and kicked golden skeletons off ships — is that anything is possible.

## The Weight of Responsibility

Beneath his bravado, Buumi carries guilt that surfaces in quiet moments. He accidentally killed a cousin in his youth — a wound that has never healed and drives his hope that he might redeem himself by saving another. After Tark was nearly killed by [[Venomfang]]'s poison breath, Buumi sat sullen in the corner — still shaken over having let his friend come so close to death. His discomfort with the group's dealings with the thieves' guild led him to walk out of the tent rather than participate in morally gray negotiations.

When the group prepared to descend into the Underdark, Buumi made the difficult choice to stay behind in Neverwinter — attending to family safety, the construction of the Keep, his Paladin Order, and the crusade against [[Orcus]]. [[Aliyah Faen Tlabbar|Patches]] was genuinely upset at his decision but understood. With Fëanon's teleportation abilities, he reminded the group he was only "a few steps away."

## In the Chasm

During the descent into the Chasm beneath Neverwinter, Buumi served as the group's anchor — carrying both the maddened [[Kangaxx]] and the wounded Myria simultaneously through the insanity-inducing labyrinth. He held the defensive line against the spider horde alongside Tark, tanked devastating hits from Glabrezu demons in the vault, and attempted to shove Kangaxx's golden lich form overboard during the storm-tossed ship battle — though the lich sidestepped, setting up Tark's finishing kick moments later.

## The City Guard

Buumi takes his duties as Captain of the City Guard seriously, always on the lookout for threats to the city and its people. He is a respected and well-liked leader whose men and women trust and follow him without question.

## Relationships

Buumi's relationship with [[Aliyah Faen Tlabbar|Patches]] is one of the group's longest-running threads. Drawn to each other despite vastly different temperaments — his lawful principles against her chaotic instincts — they have danced around mutual attraction for years. The stakes deepened when Patches proposed a marriage — framed as a binding protection pact for their children, Finn and Cercei, in the eyes of noble houses and their gods. Buumi, badly hungover at the time, was touched but asked to think about it in a proper state of mind. His family, meanwhile, had arranged a betrothal to a noblewoman, with a formal announcement planned at a debutante ball in Silverymoon — a complication he discussed privately with Tark in a carriage, admitting "it's all so confusing."

His friendship with Tark is perhaps his most uncomplicated bond — the two share a comfortable rapport built on shared combat, mutual respect, and the kind of physical humor that involves accidentally knocking each other to the ground. He and [[Gundren Rockseeker]] are drinking companions who celebrate returns by going out partying together.

## Secret

In his youth, Buumi was fascinated by stories of dragon knights and their powerful mounts. As he grew older, he realized his attraction to dragons was more than mere fascination. These feelings were not widely accepted, so he has tried to suppress them, though they continue to haunt him and he struggles with feelings of shame and isolation.
