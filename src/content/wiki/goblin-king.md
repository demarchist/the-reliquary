The Goblin King is less a person than a force of nature wearing a crown. He rules Goblin Town — a sprawling shanty settlement in the extradimensional Bog beneath the [[Tavern of Doors]] — with absolute and capricious authority. Everyone in his domain has been wronged by him: [[Demetrius]] has had his property stolen, [[Lorde]] was locked in the stocks, and countless others live under his thumb. He is feared, hated, and obeyed in equal measure.

What makes the Goblin King truly dangerous is not his power but his desperation. He is trapped. The Bog is a collapsing demiplane, and the Goblin King knows it. His only way out is to consume the mind of someone from the prime material plane and wear their body like a suit — which is exactly what he attempted with [[Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews|JmJm]], luring the bard into the labyrinth and binding him in chains.

## Nature

The Goblin King is a shapeshifter of terrifying versatility. He first appeared as a cyclone of crows that merged into a single figure perched in a gnarled tree. When struck down, he did not die — a nearby crystal shattered and he reformed instantly as a towering Goblin-Drider, a spider-goblin centaur twice his previous size, capable of summoning more of the twisted creatures to his side. Doctor Breakfast's moonbeam forced him back into his lesser goblin form, suggesting his transformations draw on external power sources — the crystals scattered throughout the Bog.

He possesses potent charm magic, capable of turning enemies against their friends mid-battle. He seized [[Tarkathee Daru|Tark]]'s mind during their fight and sent the monk after his own companions. He commands waves of goblin fodder, Drider-goblins that can turn invisible, and even animated treants.

## Downfall

When the group finally dealt the Goblin King a blow he could not recover from, he was knocked from his magical slippers — and the Bog shattered. The demiplane began to collapse. The Goblin King grew to titan size, a colossal outline looming over the horizon, destroying everything in his path as he moved toward Goblin Town. Whether this was a final desperate act or simply what happened when the entity that held the plane together lost control is unclear. The group fled up a staircase into the sky as the titan obliterated the world behind them.
