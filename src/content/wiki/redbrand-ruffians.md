The Redbrand Ruffians are a bandit gang formed by Iarno (also known as Glasstaff) to fleece the frontier town of Phandalin. They operate out of tunnels beneath Tresendar Manor and are supported by bugbears sent by the Black Spider.

Iarno was originally a member of the Lords Alliance, sent to establish a constabulary in Phandalin. Instead, he was corrupted through contact with the Black Spider's noble connections and turned the assignment into a criminal enterprise. The party clears the Redbrands from Phandalin early in the campaign.
