Demetrius is a Malk — a massive, cat-like Grimalkin — and the most civilised creature in [[Goblin Town]]. He hosts tea parties in the [[The Bog|Bog]] for anyone polite enough to sit down, serves drinks at his establishment (the mushroom inn), and conducts himself with the relaxed authority of someone who has been running things longer than anyone can remember.

The group first encountered Demetrius at a tea party in the Bog, where he lounged among the mushrooms and offered casual advice alongside a warning about the Black Dragon in the nearby tower. He was friendly, unhurried, and entirely unconcerned about the dangers of his environment — the Bog was home, and Demetrius had made his peace with it.

In Goblin Town, Demetrius owned and operated the inn, tending the bar himself. He had a straightforward request for the group: the [[The Goblin King|Goblin King]] had stolen his property, and he wanted it back. Since the group was already planning to enter the labyrinth to rescue [[Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews|JmJm]], the objectives aligned. [[Horatio Von Bumidere|Buumi]], satisfied that they would be retrieving stolen goods for their rightful owner, had no moral objection.

Demetrius was notably afraid of [[Kazoo]] — specifically her enormous battleaxe — though he was happy to facilitate an introduction by trading [[Doc|Doctor Breakfast]] a bucket of clams, which he knew Kazoo could not resist.
