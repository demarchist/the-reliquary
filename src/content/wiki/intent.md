Intent — shortened to Tent by the group within minutes of meeting him — is a planeswalking entity who arrived in JmJm's room via a fractal-edged portal, naked, blue-skinned, and profoundly confused. He changes bodies as he moves between planes, and this humanoid form was entirely new to him. He did not understand his anatomy, was bewildered by the concept of clothing, and discovered urination for the first time in front of a room full of adventurers.

[[Horatio Von Bumidere|Buumi]], operating on pure paladin instinct, immediately took Tent under his wing. He offered the bewildered entity whiskey — which Tent chugged enthusiastically, unaware of the consequences — and had to snatch the skin back before Tent drank the whole thing. Buumi then handed him a hunting knife and sheath. [[Doc|Doctor Breakfast]] gave him her elven chain, which magically resized to fit, albeit snugly. A blue man in urine-soaked pants, wielding a large knife and wearing a chain shirt too small for him, joined the expedition into the [[The Bog|Bog]].

What Tent actually is — where he comes from, what he was before this body, what his purpose might be — remains unknown. He appeared through a door in the [[Tavern of Doors]] that thrummed with magical energy growing outward in veins and roots. His arrival may have been connected to JmJm's disappearance, or it may have been entirely coincidental. Tent himself offered no answers, being too busy discovering what a body was.
