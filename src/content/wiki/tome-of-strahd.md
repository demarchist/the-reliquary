The Tome of Strahd is the personal journal of Strahd Von Zarovich, detailing the vampire lord's history, his descent into darkness, and the events that led to the creation of the cursed domain of Barovia. The tome is one of the key artifacts that Madame Eva's card reading identified as essential to the party's quest to confront Strahd. Its pages contain entries written in Strahd's own hand, chronicling his love for Tatyana, his jealousy of Sergei, and the pact with dark powers that transformed him into a vampire.

The party's careful study of the Tome, along with Sergei's journal, revealed the crucial truth that Rahadin had been manipulating events between the brothers. These revelations proved instrumental in the final confrontation with Strahd, as Ireena used the journal entries to convince Strahd of his chamberlain's centuries of treachery and deception.
