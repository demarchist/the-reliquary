The Red Wizards of Thay are an ancient and powerful order of arcane practitioners from the eastern land of Thay. They supply weapons, assassins, and magical resources to various factions, making them a persistent and dangerous threat across Faerûn.

Their Thayan Drop Boxes — enchanted containers filled with weapons and resources — are discovered by the party, revealing the extent of their covert operations. The Red Wizards' involvement in regional conflicts adds another layer of danger to the party's already complex political landscape.
