The Zhentarim, also known as the Black Network, is a powerful mercantile and criminal organization that operates across Faerûn. Originally founded as a militaristic force devoted to the god Bane, the Zhentarim has evolved into a sprawling network of merchants, mercenaries, and smugglers who seek to dominate trade and accumulate wealth and power by any means necessary. Their agents are everywhere, and their operations range from legitimate commerce to assassination, extortion, and the slave trade.

The Black Network's influence extends into nearly every major city and trade route in Faerûn, making them a faction that the Spellforged must account for in their political calculations. Whether encountered as rivals, reluctant allies, or outright enemies, the Zhentarim's pragmatic approach to power means they can be bargained with when interests align.
