Gromph Baenre is the Archmage of Menzoberranzan and a member of House Baenre, the ruling Drow noble house. His reckless magical experiments are responsible for summoning the Demon Lords into the Underdark, creating a catastrophe that threatens all subterranean civilizations.

At House Baenre's behest, Gromph eventually casts the ritual to banish the Demon Lords — though the true motivations behind both the summoning and the banishment remain entangled in Drow political machinations.
