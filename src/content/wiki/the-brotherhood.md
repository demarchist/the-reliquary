The Brotherhood is a fanatical cult operating in Baldur's Gate that claims to be cleansing the city of necromancers. In practice, the organization has devolved into witch-hunt-style mob justice, burning innocent people in their zealous purges.

The Paladins of Lathander suspect something sinister about the Brotherhood's true motives. Their presence in the city adds another layer of danger during a time when Baldur's Gate is already besieged by the undead mists.
