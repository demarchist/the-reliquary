Vargas Vallakovich is the Burgomaster of Vallaki — a paranoid and increasingly unhinged ruler who governs through intimidation and mandatory celebrations. His enforcer Izek, a man with a demonic arm, carries out his orders with brutal efficiency. His son Victor experiments dangerously with teleportation magic in the attic. The scheming noblewoman Lady Wachter plots to seize power from him through devil worship and manipulation.
