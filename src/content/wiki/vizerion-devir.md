Vizerion DeVir is an ancient Drow Archwizard exiled from Menzoberranzan who operates from the Tower of Araj near Gravenhollow. He orchestrates what appears to be a ritual to banish the Demon Lords from the Underdark, but the ritual masks a necromantic power-siphoning spell serving his own ambitions.

His young apprentice Grein Osstyl's attempts to become a Lich end in transformation into a Boneclaw, and his servant Kleve — a Death Slaad disguised as an ugly human — escorts visitors to his lair.
