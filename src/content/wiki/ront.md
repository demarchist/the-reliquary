Ront is an orc who escaped imprisonment in Velkynvelve alongside the party during their early days in the Underdark. Sent by Gruumsh on a quest to find an object of power beneath the surface, Ront initially traveled with the Spellforged but was separated from them at Sloobludop. A proud and hot-tempered warrior, he spat at Patches' feet when she admitted to being a deserter, and his abrasive personality made him a difficult companion.

After the party left Sloobludop, Ront fell under the influence of Demogorgon's agents. An Incubus demon attached itself to the orc, granting him warlock abilities including Eldritch Blast and Dimension Door. When the party re-encountered Ront in the Darklake region, he attacked them under the Incubus's command before slinking away. He later appeared again in Gracklstugh, cloaked and hostile, continuing to serve as an unwitting pawn of demonic forces. The party recognized that his corruption was tied to Demogorgon's growing influence in the Underdark.
