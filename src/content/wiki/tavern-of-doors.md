The Tavern of Doors is a magical extradimensional space gifted to JmJm by the goddess Sharess. It appears as a small box or chest, but opens into a growing tavern complete with rooms, a kitchen, stables, and a forge.

The party uses the Tavern of Doors as portable housing and refuge throughout their adventures. The space grows and expands over time, and is tended by Astral Goblins including Mr. Pickles. The forge within was used by the Rockseeker brothers to craft Gundren's clockwork lion, Guinevere.
