Zenghi the Lich is an ancient lich originating from the Bloodstone Lands, specifically the Desecrated Barrows in Vaasa. A powerful necromancer, he has a history of annihilating communities and raising undead armies.

## Threat

Zenghi aims to expand his dominion by destabilizing regions like Thunder Bluff through necromantic afflictions and chaos. He commands advanced necromantic magic, including possession, undead creation, and widespread curses.

## Enmity with Tark

Zenghi's past includes the destruction of Tarkathee Daru's homeland and the deaths of Tark's family and mentor. This atrocity drives Tark's deep thirst for revenge and represents one of the most personal conflicts within the Faerûn Defense Force's many battles.
