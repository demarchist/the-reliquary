description: "High-Marshal of Silverymoon — a High Elf warrior in seamless silver plate armour who commands the Mythal Golems and the Senior Council."

High-Marshal Arasume is the supreme military commander of Silverymoon and the most powerful figure in the city's defence. A High Elf with sharp features, black iridescent hair and softly glowing green eyes — a single scar splitting her lower lip — she is rarely seen outside her extraordinary armour: seamless silver plate with no visible joints or seams, banded with mithril and adamantite in patterns reminiscent of musculature. The helmet retracts and folds into itself at her will. Eight great silver swords float in an arc above and behind her like wings, each independently targetable.

Her entrance at the Battle for Silverymoon was decisive. She landed with tremendous force before the cowering Amnian army as the Senior Council circled overhead and the Mythal Golems converged on the square. Her magically amplified voice offered the invaders fair terms: they had shown restraint against civilians and would be ransomed back to Amn rather than executed. Most of the Amnian soldiers simply sat down.

In the aftermath, Arasume proved as sharp in council as in battle. She rewarded the group for uncovering government traitors and thwarting the coup, awarding them the Barony of Thunder Bluff. She called the Council of Helm's Hold — a summit of all major powers on the continent — recognising that the threats of Zhengyi, Orcus and the artefacts demanded a coordinated response beyond any single city's capability.
