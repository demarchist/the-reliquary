Claudine is a human woman and former contact of Patches (Aliyah Faen Tlabbar) with connections to Bregan D'aerthe. She was lost to the Muzgardt Duergar clan several years before the party arrived in Gracklstugh, working as a slave laborer in their brewery operation. Patches sought her out to find a way into Menzoberranzan that was less conspicuous than the obvious routes.

When Patches finally located Claudine in the Muzgardt Brewery's alchemy shop, the woman did not initially recognize the drow. Only when Patches removed her Platinum mask did Claudine recognize her old associate, calling her by her true name, "Alyah." Claudine lives with her half-drow daughter Zella, who works alongside her restocking shelves. Despite being under the watchful and demanding eye of her Duergar overseer Seke, Claudine was able to share intelligence about Faen Tlabbar with Patches during their covert meetings.
