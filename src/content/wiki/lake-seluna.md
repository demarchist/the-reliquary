Lake Seluna is a body of water within the Barony of Thunder Bluff. In its center lies the rocky, forested island of Sërindë Isle — home to Fëanon's tower. On the mainland shore stands the Fane of Selune, Cirrus Al Kayan's towering white marble spire.

The lake serves as a natural boundary between these two rival landmarks, with Fëanon's tower rising from the island and Cirrus' Fane looming on the shore.
