Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, is the most important and influential city on the Sword Coast and arguably all of Faerûn. Built against the slopes of Mount Waterdeep and protected by its massive walls, the city is a center of commerce, culture, and political power. It is governed by masked Lords and an Open Lord, with Dagult Neverember having served in that capacity. The city's vast wealth and strategic location make it a hub for adventurers, merchants, and political intrigue.

Waterdeep's influence extends far beyond its walls, with its leaders and factions playing key roles in the wider politics of the Sword Coast. The party's connections to Waterdeep through figures like Neverember and organizations like the Harpers have provided crucial support and resources throughout their campaign.
