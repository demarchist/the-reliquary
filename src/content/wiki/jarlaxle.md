Jarlaxle is the flamboyant leader of Bregan D'aerthe, the outlaw Drow mercenary organization. Operating outside Menzoberranzan's official power structure, he maintains a network of agents and operatives including the psionicist Kimmuriel and the local leader Lo'Dan.

Jarlaxle negotiates with the party for the release of Finn (Patches' son) and provides aid against the Demon Lords threatening the Underdark. His pragmatic, self-serving charm makes him a valuable but unpredictable ally.
