Cercei is a young girl residing at the Bumidere estate under the care of Buumi's family. She was placed under the tutelage of Mr. Shon, a sage and expert on dragons and arcane knowledge, hired on Buumi's recommendation. Despite starting as quite a handful, Cercei improved significantly under Shon's guidance. She is often seen wearing flowing red dresses with elaborate bows, and has a headstrong personality, once spotted berating her tutor while he hung his head in apparent shame.

The party harbors suspicions about Cercei's true nature, with Buumi expressing a desire to "save" her from becoming evil like other chromatic dragons, suggesting she may be a dragon in humanoid form. JmJm's Truesight later revealed that both Cercei and Leigham were actually Simulacra, clay puppet replicas rather than the real individuals, adding another layer of mystery to her true identity and whereabouts.
