Iarno, also known as Glasstaff, is a former member of the Lords Alliance who was sent to establish a constabulary in Phandalin. Instead, corrupted through contact with the Black Spider's noble connections, he formed the Redbrand Ruffians to fleece the town, operating out of tunnels beneath Tresendar Manor.
