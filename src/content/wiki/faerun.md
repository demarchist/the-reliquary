Faerûn is the primary continent of the world of Toril, a vast and diverse land stretching from the frozen reaches of Icewind Dale in the north to the jungles of Chult in the south. It encompasses hundreds of nations, city-states, and wildernesses, and is home to humans, elves, dwarves, and countless other races. The Sword Coast, the Silver Marches, and the great deserts of Anauroch are among its most notable regions.

Faerûn serves as the stage for the Rise of Atropos campaign, with the party's adventures spanning from Phandalin and the Sword Coast to Silverymoon, the Underdark, Barovia, and the Barony of Selunia. The Faerûn Defense Force was established to coordinate resistance against the growing threats to the continent, with the Spellforged Adventuring Company playing a central role in its defense.
