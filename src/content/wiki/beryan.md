Beryan is a female Sun Elf and a Sage of Selûné who resides in Fëanon's Tower in the Barony of Selunia. She serves as the party's primary researcher and lorekeeper, maintaining connections with the libraries of Evermeet and possessing an extensive personal collection of tomes. Beryan has provided critical intelligence on subjects ranging from the demon lord Orcus to the goddess Auril, and her expertise in ancient texts has proven invaluable time and again.

Despite often being exasperated by the constant demands placed upon her, Beryan throws herself into research with enthusiasm, particularly when presented with ancient artifacts or mysteries. She has investigated subjects as diverse as the pre-Crown War dark elves known as the Illythiri, the nature of Chardalyn crystals, and ancient legends of Selûné. During the attack on the Barony, Beryan helped defend the tower alongside Giuseppe and Uira, demonstrating that her talents extend beyond scholarship.
