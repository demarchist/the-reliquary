Gurnik is the High Priest of Blingdenstone, a Svirfneblin cleric who commands earth elementals and leads the spiritual life of the deep gnome community. He first made contact with the party as they explored the tunnels near Blingdenstone, approaching them with an elemental escort and guiding them to meet the settlement's chief. Gurnik's priestly abilities and knowledge of the local Underdark proved essential in the party's efforts to liberate Blingdenstone from its lingering curse.

Gurnik coordinated closely with the Spellforged during the assault on Rockblight, preparing his acolytes and elementals to push into the cursed district once the Bane was dealt with. He provided earth-glide transportation for the party, facilitated their investigation of the Standing Stone, and rejoiced when the curse of Blingdenstone was finally lifted with the death of the corrupted priestess. After the liberation, Gurnik and Chief Diggermattock began planning a massive expansion into the reclaimed northern caverns, and the grateful gnomes promised formal trade negotiations with Selunia.
