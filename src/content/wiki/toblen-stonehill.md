Toblen Stonehill is the innkeeper of the Stonehill Inn in Phandalin. When the party arrived in town, their bard put on such a convincing performance that Toblen offered the entire group free room and board. The inn served as the party's base of operations during their time in Phandalin and was where they overheard many of the rumors that guided their early adventures.
