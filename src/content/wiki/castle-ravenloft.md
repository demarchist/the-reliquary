Castle Ravenloft is the massive dark gothic castle of Strahd Von Zarovich, perched atop a twelve-hundred-foot column of rock — the Pillarstone — above the village of Barovia. It serves as the seat of his power over the cursed demiplane and houses his vampire court, crypts, dark sanctums, and an army of hibernating vampire spawn numbering in the hundreds.

## Notable Locations

The castle is a labyrinth of trapped corridors, haunted chambers, and architectural grandeur gone to rot. Key locations include: the dining hall where Strahd hosted the party for a tense political dinner; the Hall of Bones, a cathedral of death decorated entirely with human remains where the dragon skull of Argynvost was mounted as a trophy; Rahadin's meticulously kept office with its crystal communication orb; Strahd's private library and study overlooking a portrait of Tatyana; the crystal heart high in the towers, a massive pulsing organ that shakes the walls with each beat; the catacombs with dozens of stone crypts and a teleportation brazier coded to coloured gemstones; and Sergei's pristine white marble tomb where his perfectly preserved body, journal, armour, and sword hilt were found.

## The Final Battle

During the group's final assault, Strahd channelled the Fragment of the Last Word in the desecrated chapel to tear the castle free of Barovia's demiplane. The structure cracked and fractured under the immense magical forces — chunks of wall and floor broke free and floated in the strange energies. The grand hall became the arena for the battle against Rahadin in his silver dragon form, with the castle shattering around the combatants and magenta light seeping through widening fissures.

The castle materialised in the Anauroch desert with much of its structure floating in pieces — a state Fëanon believed might be permanent. The blue dragon Anaxtrasa claimed it as her domain, and the Rockseeker brothers harvested what they could from Rahadin's corpse before the three-hour deadline expired.
