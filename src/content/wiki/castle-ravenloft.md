Castle Ravenloft is the massive dark gothic castle of Strahd Von Zarovich, looming above the village of Barovia. It serves as the seat of his power over the cursed demiplane and houses his vampire court, crypts, and dark sanctums.

The castle's winding halls and towers are home to Strahd's vampire brides and courtiers, traps both magical and mundane, and the Tomb of Sergei — Strahd's murdered brother. The party's assault on Castle Ravenloft represents the climax of the Barovia chapter.
