Phandalin is a frontier town of some forty to forty-five buildings, built atop older ruins in the foothills near the Sword Mountains. When the party first arrives, the town is plagued by the Redbrand Ruffians operating out of tunnels beneath Tresendar Manor.

After the party clears the Redbrands, Phandalin enjoys a brief period of peace — cut short when the green dragon Venomfang attacks the town, is killed, and rises as a Dracolich with a glowing orange gemstone heart. The Dracolich's breath kills half the town's population and raises them as zombies before the party destroys it. The devastation of Phandalin marks a turning point in the campaign.
