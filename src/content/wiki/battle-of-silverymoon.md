## Overview

The Battle of Silverymoon was a pivotal military confrontation resulting from an Amnian attempt to seize control of the elven city through a coordinated coup. The battle climaxed at the Plaza of the Watchers before the House Invincible.

## The Invasion

Amnian forces, supported by the Ironarm Mercenary Company and aided by traitors like Von Issinger (Master of Coin) and Captain Mikael of the Spellguard, attempted to overthrow Silverymoon's government. The Amnian Archmage Shaahir and S'Olaa (Cirrus' brother) played key roles in the attack.

## Outcome

High-Marshal Arasume led the city's defense, and the party's intervention proved decisive. The Amnian forces were repelled, restoring Silverymoon's independence and exposing the traitors within.
