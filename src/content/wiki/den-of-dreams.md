The Den of Dreams is a magical sanctum housed in the basement of the Fane of Selune, open to members of the public for a fee.

## Atmosphere

The Den is dark and smoky, filled with pillars and pillows, hushed whispers, and the occasional sound of quiet sobbing. It is an otherworldly and unsettling place that exists at the boundary between waking and dreaming.

## Services

Visitors can pay to be magically transported into the dreams of others — a powerful and intimate form of magical experience. Many, however, choose to pay a lesser fee to be chemically transported into dreams of their own design through the use of hallucinogenic smoke.
