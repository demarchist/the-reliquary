Barovia is a cursed demiplane trapped in eternal mist, ruled by the vampire lord Strahd Von Zarovich. The land is perpetually gloomy, its people downtrodden and fearful, and escape is nearly impossible without defeating Strahd himself.

## Notable Locations

The demiplane contains several key locations the party explores during their campaign against Strahd:

- **Castle Ravenloft** — Strahd's massive dark gothic castle looming above the village
- **Vallaki** — A fortified town wracked by internal strife under the paranoid Burgomaster Vargas
- **Argynvolsthold** — A ruined manor housing the remains of the silver dragon Argynvost
- **The Amber Temple** — An ancient temple on Mt. Ghakis imprisoning shards of the dark entity Atropos
- **Old Bonegrinder** — A decrepit windmill housing a coven of hags
- **Tser Pool** — A pool at the base of a waterfall hiding dangers beneath its surface

## Key Allies

The party finds allies among Barovia's beleaguered inhabitants, including the Keepers of the Feather (an order of were-ravens), the vampire hunter Van Richten (disguised as the bard Rictavio), his apprentice Ezmerelda, and the dusk elf mage Kasimir.
