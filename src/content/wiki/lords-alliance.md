The Lords' Alliance is a coalition of rulers from cities and towns across the Sword Coast and the North, united for mutual defense, trade, and the rule of law. Member cities include Neverwinter, Waterdeep, and many other settlements.

Iarno was a member of the Lords' Alliance, originally sent to Phandalin to establish a constabulary and bring order to the frontier town. Instead, corrupted by the Black Spider's influence, he formed the Redbrand Ruffians and used his position for personal gain. He claimed that no one else in the Alliance knew of his betrayal.
