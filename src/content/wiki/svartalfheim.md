Svartalfheim is a realm within the broader planar cosmology associated with dark elves and subterranean beings. Drawing from Norse mythological tradition, it represents the homeland of the svartalfar, the dark elves or dwarves of legend. In the context of the multiverse, Svartalfheim exists as one of the many planes and demiplanes that intersect with the Material Plane.

The realm's connection to the dark elves of Faerûn and their planar heritage adds depth to the complex web of planes and dimensions that the party has encountered throughout their travels, from the Underdark to the Shadowfell and beyond.
