Zhengyi, the Witch-King, is a powerful lich who once ruled the desolate land of Vaasa with an iron fist, commanding armies of undead and monstrous servants. His original reign of terror was ended by a coalition of heroes, but the wizard Theodemir sacrificed his very life force to cast a spell that kept Zhengyi sealed away. For years this spell held, but a greater power has been slowly unraveling the enchantment, backing the lich's return.

The threat of Zhengyi's resurgence has been a driving force in the campaign. Theodemir's spirit, preserved within Fey's Ring of Mind Shielding, warned that the spell was failing, giving the party only hours before it collapsed entirely. The Witch-King's return represents one of the most dangerous threats facing the North, and the party's efforts to stop or contain him have shaped much of their journey.
