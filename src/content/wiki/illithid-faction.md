The Illithid, commonly known as mind flayers, are a race of psionic aberrations that feed on the brains of sentient creatures. With their tentacled faces, vast psionic powers, and utterly alien intelligence, the Illithid are among the most feared creatures in the Underdark and beyond. They once ruled a vast empire that spanned the multiverse, enslaving entire races including the ancestors of the Duergar and Githyanki. Though their empire has fallen, Illithid hives still operate in the deep places of the world, conducting dark experiments and plotting to reclaim their former glory.

The Illithid have been a significant threat throughout the campaign. An Illithid hive played a central role in the events surrounding Fey'Anon's capture and the corruption of Theodemir's sealing spell. The party encountered Illithid vessels on the Darklake and had to contend with their psionic influence during their time in the Underdark. The "Eye of Theodemir" and the Illithid hive were among the topics discussed at the Council of Helm's Hold as part of the broader threat assessment facing the North.
