Kangaxx was a liar of extraordinary talent. He first appeared as a gold-toothed adventurer — charismatic, helpful, eager to join the group's mission into the celestial vault beneath Neverwinter's Chasm. He laughed at their jokes, fought at their side, and earned their trust over the course of several dangerous sessions underground. None of them suspected what he was until it was too late.

His true form was a golden lich skeleton — radiant and terrible, one of the so-called Sons of [[Orcus]]. Everything about his time with the party had been calculated. He wanted a shard of [[The Last Word]], a creation of immense power that had been split into five fragments and scattered across the multiverse. Orcus himself had been responsible for its sundering.

## The Betrayal

Deep in the vault, Kangaxx dropped his disguise and attempted to seize the shard. His transformation and betrayal triggered a desperate fight that required the combined efforts of the party and [[Lo'Dan]]'s Bregan D'aerthe forces to survive. The group managed to deny him the artifact, and [[Tarkathee Daru|Tark]] — in one of the campaign's more satisfying moments — kicked the lich overboard and into the sea during their escape.

But Kangaxx was not finished. He survived.

## The Siege of Baldur's Gate

Kangaxx returned at the end of the Bog arc, appearing as a golden figure floating above the docks of [[Baldur's Gate]]. He raised his hands and tore open a window in reality, revealing a starlit void with a dark, unlit planetoid at its centre. A vast alien consciousness pressed down on the city. A meteor streaked from the rift and smashed into the streets. Then the undead horde came — everything that had ever died along the seafloor rose and marched on the city's defenders.

Kangaxx floated in a globe of pure invulnerability, exchanging magical fire with the Archmage [[Amaram]] and the Mage's Guild, seemingly untouchable. [[Ysera]], revealing her true form as an Ancient Golden Dragon, crashed into him and knocked him from the sky — but even that was not enough to destroy him.

## Death

The group fought their way through the burning city to the meteor crater, where they discovered the Atropal Knight — a creature connected to Kangaxx's power. The battle was brutal. The Atropal drained life force with every wail and healed itself with the stolen vitality. When the group finally brought it to the brink and struck the killing blow, Kangaxx screamed from the sky. He rocketed toward the crater at impossible speed, but he was too late. The Atropal detonated, and Kangaxx with it — a burst of light like a mountain shattering.

What remained of the golden skeleton was black and slagged, the edges melted like wax. As the group watched, the last pieces cracked, blackened, and crumbled to dust. Kangaxx was truly destroyed — in the ruined plaza of [[Lathander]], the Morning Lord, no less. A fitting end for a creature of Orcus.
