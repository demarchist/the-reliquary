Kangaxx is a deceptive mage and powerful servant of Orcus. He initially poses as a gold-toothed adventurer seeking help, but his true form is that of a golden lich skeleton — one of the so-called Sons of Orcus.

Kangaxx infiltrates the party's trust before attempting to steal a celestial artifact shard from the vault beneath Neverwinter's Chasm. His transformation and betrayal lead to a climactic confrontation that requires the combined efforts of the party and Lo'Dan's Bregan D'aerthe forces to overcome.
