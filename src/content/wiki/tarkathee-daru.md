Tarkathee Daru, known simply as Tark, is a male Halfling Monk and a respected member of the Faerûn Defense Force. He is widely regarded as the group's moral compass and peacekeeper.

## Appearance

Tark stands between three and four feet tall with a well-defined, muscled, athletic build that belies his small stature. He has a boyishly handsome face with perpetually tousled hair and tan, weather-worn skin that speaks to a life spent outdoors.

## Personality

Tark's most striking feature is his warm, welcoming demeanor. He exudes an aura of calm and wisdom that draws others to him. His frank, honest, and unfailingly positive outlook is infectious, often helping to diffuse tense situations and bring out the best in those around him.

Despite being illiterate and challenged by basic arithmetic, Tark possesses a profound worldly wisdom and an unerring moral compass. He has an extraordinary ability to see the potential for good in others, even when they can't see it themselves. His philosophy centers on the belief that everyone deserves kindness and has the potential for growth and redemption.

## Mastery of Ki

As a Monk, Tark has mastered the art of harnessing ki — a magical energy that flows through living bodies. Through years of discipline, he has learned to sustain his body such that he does not age physically, does not require food or water, and is immune to disease and poison. His fighting style is a graceful blend of acrobatics and powerful strikes, though he prefers peaceful resolution whenever possible.

## Tark's Treehouse

Tark lives alone in an elaborate treehouse deep in the forests of Thunder Bluff — a whimsical, multi-level structure cobbled together from repurposed materials, reflecting his creative and resourceful nature.

## Vendetta Against Zenghi

Tark carries a personal vendetta against Zenghi the Lich, who destroyed Tark's homeland and killed his family and mentor. This deep wound drives a thirst for revenge that contrasts with his otherwise peaceful nature.
