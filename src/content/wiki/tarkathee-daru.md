Tarkathee Daru, known simply as Tark, is a male Halfling Monk and a founding member of the Spellforged Adventuring Company. He is widely regarded as the group's moral compass and peacekeeper — a warrior of extraordinary discipline whose warmth and optimism belie a life marked by loss and hard-won wisdom.

## Appearance

Tark stands between three and four feet tall with a well-defined, muscular, athletic build that belies his small stature. He has a boyishly handsome face with a perpetually tousled mohawk, tan, weather-worn skin, and — since his encounter with the dragon [[Venomfang]] — an enchanted blindfold over his left eye. His bearing is unassuming until he moves, at which point the coiled precision of a lifetime of monastic training becomes immediately apparent.

## Personality

Tark's most striking quality is the tension between his infectious warmth and the violence of the world he inhabits. He exudes an aura of calm that draws others to him, approaches strangers with an openness bordering on naivety — he once tried to reason with an ogre by offering it flowers — and genuinely believes in the potential for good in everyone. He is illiterate and challenged by basic arithmetic, yet possesses a profound worldly wisdom and an unerring sense of right and wrong.

He is also deeply impulsive. In the early days of the campaign, he frequently charged ahead without waiting for the group, and his curiosity has led him off ledges, into traps, and face-first into walls during rooftop chases. This recklessness is tempered by a monk's discipline: he meditates regularly, centers himself before combat, and has learned — through painful experience — when to hold back. His companions have decorated his face during meditation more than once, drawing intricate eye sigils on his forehead and spiking his mohawk.

## The Blindness

During the group's first encounter with the green dragon [[Venomfang]], Tark was caught in a blast of poison breath that nearly killed him. He survived, but was left permanently blind in his left eye. The injury sent him into a visible depression — he withdrew from the group and sat alone, distraught over the damage.

His recovery came in stages. Sparring with [[Moot]] at [[Longsaddle]] lifted his spirits, and the gift of [[Ysera]] — a golden canary — gave him an emotional anchor. At the Harpell Ivy Mansion, [[Fëanon|Fëanon Sërindë]] and Penelope Harpell crafted an enchanted blindfold that, when worn over the dead eye, granted him permanent Detect Magic vision. What had been a devastating wound became a tactical advantage — Tark could now perceive magical auras, hidden enchantments, and concealed spellcasters at a glance. He celebrated his recovery by stripping naked and jumping into a river at Longsaddle, seemingly unbothered by the blindness for the first time.

## Mastery of Ki

As a Monk, Tark has mastered the art of harnessing ki — a magical energy that flows through living bodies. Through years of discipline, he has learned to sustain his body such that he does not age physically, does not require food or water, and is immune to disease and poison. His fighting style is a graceful blend of acrobatics and devastating strikes: he has shattered a knight's shield with sustained precision blows, knocked a dwarven gladiator from an arena in a single exchange, and teleported above a flying lich to drive it into the ground with his falling weight.

His stunning strikes are feared by enemies of all sizes. Against [[Kangaxx]]'s golden lich form — a creature that shrugged off lightning bolts and fireballs — it was Tark's ki-infused fists that broke through its defenses and created openings for the rest of the group.

## Moot and Ysera

Tark's relationship with [[Moot]] — a legendary monk and tournament champion — is one of the defining threads of his story. Moot recognized something in Tark early on, telling him that "study and perseverance would reveal all secrets." He gifted Tark the golden canary Ysera, who took an immediate liking to the halfling and became his constant companion. Ysera sharpens Tark's senses, granting him an alertness he cannot achieve alone, and communicates with him telepathically in moments of crisis — during the battle aboard the storm-tossed ship, she flew into the tempest with a flurry of chirps and a single word in his mind: *Survive.*

Moot later gifted Tark his personal staff after the cult attack at the Refounding Festival — a tremendous honor that Tark received with open wonder. The staff became his signature weapon, granting flight and devastating striking power.

## Tournament Champion

At the Neverwinter Refounding Festival martial tournament, Tark demonstrated his full combat prowess. He knocked the dwarven gladiator Endomycles from the ring in a single exchange, then systematically dismantled Knight Verith's defenses by splintering his shield with precise, centered strikes before pummeling him to the ground. He defeated his ally Patches by using his enchanted blindfold to spot her magical weapons through obstacles, then rushing her before she could react. His path to the final against Moot was interrupted only by the cult attack on the festival grounds.

## Into the Chasm

Tark served as the group's point man during the descent into the Chasm beneath Neverwinter. He drank a Potion of Necrotic Resistance to clear his mind of the labyrinth's maddening fog, then mapped tunnels and used Ysera to scout ahead while the rest of the group struggled with insanity. He was the first to touch the golden ward sealing the ancient vault, the first to step through the void into the cathedral chamber, and the first to study the murals depicting the fall of Orcus and the scattering of the artifact shards.

When Kangaxx revealed himself as a servant of Orcus and unleashed demons in the vault, Tark fought through being seized and dropped sixty feet by a Glabrezu's claws. After Lo'Dan's ambush triggered Kangaxx's transformation into a golden lich, the battle carried across dimensions — from a collapsing cavern to the deck of a storm-tossed ship. It was Tark who ended it, swinging on a rope from the rigging to plant a kick in the lich's chest, sending the golden skeleton over the rail and into the ocean depths.

## Barovia

In the dread domain of Barovia, Tark confronted horrors that tested even his optimism. He came face to face with his own corpse — crucified, chemically melted — hanging in the cursed forest. The sight struck him with intense paranoia, a feeling of being watched that lingered long after. Yet he also found a golden dragonscale in the mists and, meditating on it, felt a powerful conviction that it was meant for him — that it was important in ways he could not yet articulate.

## Vendetta Against Zenghi

Tark carries a personal vendetta against Zenghi the Lich, who destroyed Tark's homeland and killed his family and mentor. This deep wound drives a thirst for revenge that contrasts sharply with his otherwise peaceful nature — a reminder that even the group's moral compass has limits to his forgiveness.

## Tark's Treehouse

Tark lives alone in an elaborate treehouse deep in the forests of [[Thunder Bluff]] — a whimsical, multi-level structure cobbled together from repurposed materials, reflecting his creative and resourceful nature.
