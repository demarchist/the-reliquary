---

Dean Sejuk is the head of Silverymoon's Lady's College, a centre of arcane learning. An old colleague of Fëanon's, the two shared a history that had been poisoned by a single event: decades earlier, Sejuk had been unable to save Fëanon from Illithid enthrallment, and the guilt had weighed on him ever since. When the group arrived at his manor on the night of the Winter Solstice and Fëanon greeted him warmly — clearly free of the Mind Flayers' influence — the relief was visible.

Sejuk hosted the group in his sitting room, providing what counsel he could about the artefact, Zhengyi's imprisonment and the spell Theodemir had used. His reserved, academic temperament was tested severely that evening when the group decided to combine the two artefact shards in the middle of his house. The resulting explosion of plasma tore through walls, floors and ceilings, blew Tark through two walls and brought the entire manor down moments after everyone fled into the street. Sejuk, injured and furious, informed the group he was done with them and stormed off to stay with family.

Despite his exasperation, Sejuk's connections proved vital. His butler Vernon — an old acquaintance of Fëanon's — recognised the wizard on sight and granted them access. Sejuk's position at the College gave the group the credibility they needed to begin raising alarms about the Amnian invasion.
