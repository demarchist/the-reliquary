Damara is a kingdom in the cold northeast of Faerûn, bordered by the desolate land of Vaasa to the north. It is a hardy, frontier nation whose people have long lived under the shadow of threats from their northern neighbor, most notably the Witch-King Zhengyi and his armies of undead. Damara's warriors are renowned for their resilience and martial prowess, forged by generations of conflict with the forces of evil.

Damara's fate is closely tied to the sealing of Zhengyi, as the spell cast by Theodemir kept the lich's forces from pouring south through Vaasa into Damara and beyond. With the spell failing, the threat of Zhengyi's return looms large over both Damara and the wider North, making the party's efforts to contain the Witch-King critical to the kingdom's survival.
