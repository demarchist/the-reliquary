The Astral Plane is a vast, silvery void that serves as the connective tissue between all other planes of existence. It is a realm of thought and intention, where physical laws give way to the power of the mind. Travelers move through the Astral by force of will, and the plane is dotted with color pools that serve as portals to other dimensions. The bodies of dead gods drift through the Astral Sea, and the githyanki have built an empire among its silver expanse.

The Astral Plane's role as a connective medium makes it fundamental to planar travel and magical transportation. Many of the party's teleportation spells and planar journeys pass through or near the Astral, and the Illithid (mind flayers) who have plagued the party are known to use the Astral Plane as a highway for their psionic vessels.
