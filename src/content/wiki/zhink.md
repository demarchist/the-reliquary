Zhink is a Moon Elf warrior who serves as one of [[Lady Faye]]'s champions. He is eccentric, proud, and supernaturally quick — possessing reflexes that exceed even normal elven capabilities.

## First Meeting

The group met Zhink in the Garden District of Baldur's Gate when they went to meet [[Aliyah Faen Tlabbar|Patches]]' mysterious benefactor. [[Horatio Von Bumidere|Buumi]] attempted to intimidate Zhink with an ogre-strength handshake and got soundly bested. Zhink confirmed that Patches was indeed one of Lady Faye's champions, a revelation that astounded the group — several bets were paid off over the fact that Patches had been telling the truth. Zhink was offended by their surprise.

## Capture and Rescue

During the infiltration of Lord Fendrel's vault — which turned out to be a Duergar trap — Zhink was captured alongside Patches and Lady Faye. [[Fëanon Sërindë|Fëanon]] discovered him imprisoned across the hall from the main group and helped free him. Zhink fought alongside the group during the escape from the ancient ruins, helping to destroy the Stone Golem after the Alhoon was killed.
