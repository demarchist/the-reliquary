The Netherese were the people of Netheril, the greatest magical empire the world has ever known. At their peak, the Netherese created floating cities called enclaves, powered by mythallars that drew upon the raw magic of the Weave. Their archwizards developed spells of incredible power, pushing the boundaries of what mortal magic could achieve. The empire fell when Karsus attempted to steal Mystra's power, causing the floating cities to crash and the land to be transformed into the desert of Anauroch.

The legacy of the Netherese echoes throughout the campaign. The Mythallar, ancient Netherese artifacts of immense power, have been encountered by the party, and the ruins of Netherese civilization lie beneath the sands of Anauroch. The floating city concept and the extreme magical ambition of the Netherese serve as both an inspiration and a warning about the dangers of unchecked power.
