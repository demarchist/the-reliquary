The Triboar Trail is a road running south from Neverwinter toward the town of Phandalin. It was along this trail that the party first encountered trouble — finding signs of an ambush before being attacked by goblins. The captured goblin led them to the Cragmaw Hideout nearby, where they rescued Sildar and tricked the bugbear Klarg.
