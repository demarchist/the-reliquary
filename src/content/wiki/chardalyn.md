Chardalyn is a rare magical crystal found in the frozen north, particularly in and around Icewind Dale. The crystal has the remarkable property of absorbing magical energy, making it both incredibly valuable and potentially dangerous. Pure chardalyn can be fashioned into magical items of great power, but corrupted chardalyn, tainted by exposure to fiendish or other evil energies, can twist the minds of those who handle it and spread malevolent influence.

The properties of chardalyn make it a sought-after material for artificers and enchanters, and the party's encounters with the crystal have highlighted both its potential as a crafting material and the risks posed by its corrupted forms. Beryan the Sage has investigated chardalyn's properties as part of her ongoing research for the Spellforged.
