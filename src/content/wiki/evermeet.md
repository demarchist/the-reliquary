Evermeet is the legendary island homeland of the elves, hidden far to the west of Faerûn in the Trackless Sea. Protected by powerful magical wards and the favor of the elven gods, Evermeet serves as a refuge and repository of elven knowledge stretching back to the earliest ages of the world. Its libraries contain records dating back millennia, and its scholars are among the most learned in all the planes.

The Sage Beryan maintains connections with the libraries of Evermeet, sending inquiries to her colleagues there for information the party needs. These contacts proved valuable when researching subjects such as the ancient names Abraxim, Halashnar, and Quil'Sygoth, as well as information about the goddess Auril and the magical hammer Issgard. Evermeet's vast store of knowledge has been an invaluable resource for the Spellforged, even if accessed at a distance.
