## Description

The Titanic Forge is an ancient forge hidden deep within the magma-heated interior of Mt. Saqar. Built in an age long forgotten, it is one of the few forges capable of working titanium and other rare metals into weapons and armor of extraordinary quality.

## Properties

The forge harnesses the volcano's natural heat to achieve temperatures necessary for working titanium. Items crafted here possess exceptional durability and magical potential.

## History

The party accesses the Titanic Forge during their Al Askar adventures, crafting titanium weapons and armor for multiple party members: a spear for Tark, shield for Buumi, armor for Thorna, scimitar for JmJm, tome-box for Fëanon, and greatsword for Snorbul.
