Von Issinger is the Master of Coin of Silverymoon — a thin, hunched man who proved to be the financial lynchpin of the Amnian infiltration. His office at the Silverymoon Palace was where the paper trail converged: Amnian "gifts" flowed to Von Issinger, who laundered the money into contracts for the Ironarm Mercenary Company, bringing five hundred soldiers into the city under the guise of supplementary patrols.

Patches infiltrated the Palace at night, scaled three floors of marble, navigated magical traps and guard patrols, and found Von Issinger working late at his desk — writing furiously, distributing the orders that would put the Ironarms in position for a dawn takeover of city patrol routes. A flash bomb to the desk, a few seconds of binding, and the Master of Coin was on the floor in his own urine, answering every question put to him. He had no spine and he knew it.

The critical intelligence Patches extracted — that the Amnian move was planned for dawn, not midnight — gave the group the time they needed to prepare a defence. The documents she stole from his desk later formed the evidence presented to High Marshal Arasume after the battle. His son Chaunce, an awkward teenager running with a crew of young informants, had unwittingly helped the group piece together the conspiracy before the interrogation confirmed it.
