Ezmerelda D'Avenir is a striking Vistani woman and skilled warrior, apprentice to the legendary vampire hunter Van Richten. She travels Barovia searching for her master, and upon finding the party at Argynvostholt, becomes a fierce ally against Strahd.

## In Barovia

Ezmerelda is disciplined and meticulous — the group often found her cleaning and preparing her gear with focused intensity while others rested. She fights with rapier and handaxe, employs mirror image duplicates to confuse enemies, and possesses a fearlessness that borders on recklessness. During the battle with Rahadin, she attacked the adult silver dragon head-on and was badly battered by horn and claw before rolling clear.

Her most critical contribution in the final battle was a lightning bolt that obliterated Rahadin's shadow aura and stunned the dragon — the turning point that allowed the group to finally draw blood through his defences.

## Loss and Legacy

Ezmerelda never found Van Richten alive. He was turned in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft and destroyed by Tark before the group could reach him. After the fall of Barovia, Ezmerelda stood in the ruins of the castle — stunned, then laughing as she realised her quest was over, then sobered by the weight of Van Richten's death. Fëanon told her the old hunter went out exactly as he would have wanted, and that the mantle now fell to her. She accepted it, departed on the back of Danica's giant raven form, and called farewell as she vanished into the sunrise.

After the events in Barovia, Ezmerelda resurfaced during the Amnian war, having been enslaved by Efreeti after becoming overconfident. She was eventually freed and continues her life as a mercenary and adventurer.
