Ezmerelda D'Avenir is a striking Vistani woman and skilled warrior, apprentice to the legendary vampire hunter Van Richten. She travels Barovia searching for her master, and upon finding the party, becomes a fierce ally against Strahd.

After the events in Barovia, Ezmerelda resurfaces during the Amnian war, having been enslaved by Efreeti after becoming overconfident. She is eventually freed and continues her life as a mercenary and adventurer.
