Zuggtmoy, the Lady of Fungi, is the demon queen of fungi, molds, and all manner of rot and decay. She seeks to spread her fungal domain across all worlds, transforming living creatures into hosts for her spores and bending their minds to her will. Her followers often appear outwardly normal but are riddled with fungal infections that slowly consume their free will, turning them into willing servants of the rot.

Zuggtmoy's influence is particularly strong in the Underdark, where vast fungal forests and myconid communities exist in an uneasy balance between her corrupting touch and the natural symbiosis of the subterranean ecosystem. The party's encounters with corrupted myconids and hostile fungal creatures during their Underdark journey spoke to the Lady of Fungi's far-reaching influence.
