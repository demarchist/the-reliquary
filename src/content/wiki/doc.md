Doctor Breakfast is a Gnome Druid and a steadfast member of the Spellforged Adventuring Company. She first appeared at the Stonehill Inn in Phandalin, initially shapeshifted into a cat-person form, and quickly became one of the group's most reliable combatants. She often operates alongside [[Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews|JmJm]], with the two of them forming the group's most consistent tactical pairing.

## Combat Style

Doctor Breakfast is an aggressive, action-oriented druid whose magic leans heavily toward wind, storm, and elemental force. She commands the battlefield through area denial — devastating gusts that reposition enemies, lightning storms that punish clustered foes, and burning moonbeams that expose shapeshifters and scour the undead. During the cult attack at the Refounding Festival, she summoned a full lightning storm that damaged cultists across the arena. Against the Hydra beneath the docks, her magic helped control the beast's many heads. In Wave Echo Cave, she blasted an Ochre Jelly off JmJm with a precisely aimed gust of wind.

Her spellcasting is direct and decisive — she favors raw elemental force over subtlety, and her spell selection adapts fluidly to each encounter. She heals when the group needs it, but her instinct is offensive.

## The Pairing with JmJm

From the moment they met — "JmJm and the cat druid hit it off immediately" — Doctor Breakfast and JmJm have been inseparable allies. They retreat into the [[Tavern of Doors]] together between encounters, prepare for performances together, and coordinate their magic in combat. Their dual synchronized Thunderwave against a zombie horde was a signature moment of combined spellcasting. During the martial tournament, while JmJm cast under-the-radar enchantments from the stands, Doctor Breakfast studied the fighters with academic interest — then mimicked the cry of [[Hendrell]]'s eagle companion from above, momentarily distracting the Champion of the Moonwood and costing him a solid hit during his bout with [[Lothli]].

## Personality

Doctor Breakfast is quiet by the group's standards — she shows care through support magic rather than words, and tends to observe during social encounters before acting decisively when it matters. She has a playful streak: she once got distracted by a massive rat and chased it out to the miniature farm in the Tavern of Doors, terrifying the tiny horses. She spooked a Doppelganger's horse during Gundren's rescue with casual, practical trickery. Her druidic nature manifests as a deep primal connection — she communicates intent to Treants without words and has attempted druidic communion with twig blights even as they attacked.

## Adventures

Doc has been a steady presence through the group's journeys, from the Bog and the battles with the Goblin King through to the Barovian arc and beyond. Her druidic abilities — including Moonbeam, Windwalk, and storm conjuration — have proven invaluable in revealing shapeshifters, fighting supernatural foes, and traversing vast distances. She later accompanied JmJm, Gneiss, and Chani on missions as the party's operations expanded across the North.
