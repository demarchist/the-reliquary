Doctor Breakfast is a druid who has been a companion of the Spellforged Adventuring Company since their early adventures. Capable of healing, nature magic, and spells like Thunderwave and Plant Growth, Doc has provided crucial support throughout many of the party's engagements. She often operates alongside JmJm, with the two of them frequently entering and exiting the Tavern of Doors together to rest and recuperate between encounters.

Doc B. has been a steady presence through the party's journeys, from the Bog and the battles with the Goblin King through to the Barovian arc and beyond. Her druidic abilities, including Moonbeam, have proven invaluable in revealing shapeshifters and fighting supernatural foes. She later accompanied JmJm, Gneiss, and Chani on missions as the party's operations expanded across the North.
