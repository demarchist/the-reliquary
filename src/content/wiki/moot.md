Moot is an elderly Monk of great power, always accompanied by a flock of seven golden canaries. Despite his advanced age, his martial abilities are formidable — he defeats Lord Penterghast in the semi-finals of the Neverwinter martial tournament.

Moot befriends Tarkathee Daru and gifts him his tremendously enchanted staff before fighting alongside the group during the attack on the Neverwinter Festival. One of his canaries, Ysera, takes a particular liking to Tark and decides to follow him, granting him the Alert feat and communicating with him telepathically.
