Anauroch, the Great Desert, is a vast expanse of sand and desolation that covers much of what was once the heartland of the ancient Netherese empire. When Karsus's folly caused the floating cities of Netheril to crash to earth, the land was irrevocably changed, and the fertile plains gave way to an ever-expanding desert. Beneath its sands lie the ruins of incredible magical achievements, buried cities, and artifacts of power that draw treasure hunters and scholars alike.

Anauroch plays a notable role in the campaign as the location where Castle Ravenloft was transported after the party's liberation of Barovia. The blue dragon Anaxtrasa claimed the castle as her domain in this desert setting. The Bedine nomads wander the desert's expanse, and the remnants of Netherese magic still pulse beneath the dunes, making Anauroch a land of both desolation and hidden wonder.
