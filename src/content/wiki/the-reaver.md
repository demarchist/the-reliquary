The Reaver is a rusted shortsword found on an altar to Orcus in a nightmarish hag den. It psychically attacks anyone who handles it, feeds on souls and life force, and became bound to Patches after she claimed it — earning the nickname "Stabby" for its tendency to lash out at the unwary.

## The Cleansing

The cursed weapon required specific gemstones, a full moon, hallowed ground, and an oath to Eilistraee to destroy. Patches gathered the components over months before performing the ritual atop the white stone altar in the ruined Temple of Helm in Sundabar. She smashed each gemstone upon the blade with an enchanted mallet, reciting the oath, and when the last hag's tooth shattered, the Reaver shattered with it — unleashing an explosion of mist and frost that coated the cathedral in white.

The ritual conjured a Drider bearing Patches' face — a manifestation of her greatest fear — that spawned swarming spiders with every wound it took. Only after Patches drove a blade through the doppelgänger's heart did the manifestation crumble. The Reaver's remains melted into liquid mercury atop the altar and reformed as Eclipse, Patches' new weapon and bond to Eilistraee.

A final drop of mercury struck the altar and burst into blue flame. Cyrrus cast the remains of his tooth fairy collection into the fire, which lanced into his eyes and burned them away — leaving him blind, his eyes replaced with chrome orbs that would later grant him sight in starlight.
