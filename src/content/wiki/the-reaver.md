The Reaver is a rusted shortsword found on an altar to Orcus in a nightmarish hag den. It psychically attacks anyone who handles it, feeds on souls and life force, and becomes bound to Patches after she claims it.

The cursed weapon requires a cleansing ritual with specific gathered ingredients to sever its bond. Despite its malevolent nature, the blade's power makes it a potent — if dangerous — weapon in Patches' arsenal.
