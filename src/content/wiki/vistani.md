## Overview

The Vistani are a nomadic people found throughout Barovia and the surrounding regions. They maintain camps across the valley, sustaining themselves through trade, services, and their renowned fortune-telling abilities.

## Culture

Vistani culture values freedom, family bonds, and life on the open road. They possess deep knowledge of the lands they traverse and serve as some of the few who can freely enter and leave Barovia's cursed borders.

## Notable Members

Madame Eva is the most prominent Vistani the party encounters — an ancient seer whose tarokka card readings reveal the path to defeating Strahd. The innkeeper Ivonova also provides the party with early information about Barovia's curse.
