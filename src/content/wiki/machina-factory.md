## Description

The Machina Factory is an ancient Saurian manufacturing facility hidden within Thueba Swamp. Despite its age, it retains functional technology including a database of Ringed Veil (Fargate) addresses and manufacturing capabilities for machina bodies.

## Significance

The factory is crucial to the party's goal of returning to Faerûn, as its database contains the Ringed Veil coordinates needed for planar travel. Hasrala, the ancient Saurian scholar, is placed into a machina body constructed here and helps the party access the coordinate database.
