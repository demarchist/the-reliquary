## Description

The Delzoun Instant Fortress is a dwarven-crafted magical item that takes the form of a small object when dormant. When activated, it expands into a full-sized adamantite tower providing shelter and defense.

## Properties

Constructed from adamantite by Delzoun dwarven artificers, the fortress is nearly indestructible when deployed. It provides the party with a portable stronghold that can be erected anywhere, offering protection in the most hostile environments.
