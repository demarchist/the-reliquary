Oerth is an alternate prime material plane, distinct from but connected to Toril through the vast network of planar pathways. It is most notably the home world of the archmage Mordenkainen, one of the most powerful wizards in the multiverse. Oerth has its own nations, conflicts, and magical traditions, and the planar barriers between it and Toril are permeable enough for powerful beings to cross between them.

Mordenkainen traveled from Oerth to assist the party during the Barovian crisis, lending his vast knowledge and power to their efforts against Strahd. He eventually returned to Oerth when he became worried that his own world was under attack, demonstrating that the threats facing the multiverse extend beyond any single prime material plane.
