Peytr is a towering vampire barbarian and one of the most dangerous members of Strahd Von Zarovich's enslaved vampire court. Like the other vampire adventurers — Kenga, Beerna, Growland, and Lelrin — Peytr was once a mortal hero who fell to Strahd's power and was bound against his will as a thrall.

## Appearance and Nature

Even among vampires, Peytr is physically imposing — a giant of a man with the deep booming voice of a seasoned warrior. He wields a massive obsidian-headed axe that is paradoxically light in his hands, capable of being thrown with devastating accuracy and magically recalled. The axe proved to be heavily cursed, and after Peytr's destruction the group disposed of it by feeding it to Cyrrus's bag of devouring, casting it adrift in the Astral Plane.

## The Hunt

Peytr serves as the primary enforcer during the group's time inside Castle Ravenloft. When blood is drawn at the dinner and every vampire in the room loses control, it is Peytr who leads the pursuit — seeping through walls of force as mist, hurling his axe up stairwells to wound multiple targets, and shrugging off lightning bolts and greased floors. On the rooftop bridge, his thrown axe strikes the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, detonating the artifact in a blinding explosion and nearly killing Buumi.

He commands the Wild Hunt — the spectral cavalry and vampire army that circles Vallaki — and personally leads the assault on Krezk when the group shelters at the Abbey of St. Markovia. It is there, after the Planetar Anduriel sacrifices himself to reforge the crystal greatsword, that Tark wields the newborn Ashbringer and annihilates the Wild Hunt. Peytr is knocked from bat form by the cascading sunburst chain reaction, trades blows with Patches, and is finally destroyed when Tark's strike sends him detonating in a final sunburst that destroys every remaining undead in range.
