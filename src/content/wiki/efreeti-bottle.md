## Description

The Efreeti Bottle is a magical container found in the basement of the Golden Tower in Iyum. It serves as a prison for an Ifrit known as the Insufferable One.

## Properties

The bottle functions as both a trap and a potential resource. Opening it releases the Insufferable One, an Ifrit of considerable power and, as his name suggests, extremely difficult personality.
