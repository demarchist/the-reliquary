## Overview

The Cult of Zalaam, also known as the Black Skull, is a malevolent organization dedicated to the worship of Zalaam — an avatar or manifestation of Vecna. The cult has established a significant presence across Al Askar, spreading corruption and dark magic wherever they operate.

## Operations

The cult operates through hidden cells and shrines, led by figures like Sebek, the Speaker of the Black Skull. They recruit the desperate and ambitious, engage in ritualistic corruption, and seek forbidden artifacts to further Vecna's designs.

## Opposition

The Usurpers of Rudjek, the Medjay, and the priestess Liara (who worships the true aspect of Zalaam as god of death) all actively oppose the cult's corrupted practices.
