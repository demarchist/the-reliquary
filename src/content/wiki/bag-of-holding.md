A Bag of Holding is a common but invaluable magical item that opens into a nondimensional space, allowing it to hold far more than its outward size would suggest. The interior of a typical bag can hold up to 500 pounds of material in a space that appears to be about 4 feet in diameter and 4 feet deep. The bag always weighs only 15 pounds regardless of its contents, making it essential equipment for adventurers who need to carry large quantities of loot, supplies, or equipment.

The Spellforged have made extensive use of Bags of Holding throughout their adventures, employing them for everything from standard equipment storage to creative tactical applications. Tark used one to transport Ront through a flooded tunnel, and the bags have served as impromptu storage for rescued prisoners, valuable artifacts, and the enormous quantities of treasure the party has accumulated over their campaigns.
