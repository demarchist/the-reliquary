A Bag of Holding is a common but invaluable magical item that opens into a nondimensional space, allowing it to hold far more than its outward size would suggest. The interior of a typical bag can hold up to 500 pounds of material in a space that appears to be about 4 feet in diameter and 4 feet deep. The bag always weighs only 15 pounds regardless of its contents, making it essential equipment for adventurers who need to carry large quantities of loot, supplies, or equipment.

## Wet and Dry Bags

A Bag of Holding is not simply a bag with a pocket dimension inside it. The nondimensional space is *extruded through* the material of the bag itself — the fabric serves as a membrane between the material plane and the extradimensional void. When the enchantment is first laid, this membrane has not yet stabilized. The pocket dimension is still settling against the material plane, and the planar boundary oscillates — microscopically expanding and contracting as the two realities negotiate their interface.

Each contraction pushes trace amounts of astral medium through the weave of the fabric. On the material plane, astral medium cannot maintain its native form and condenses into a cool, faintly iridescent dampness — not quite water, not quite oil. It doesn't evaporate so much as reabsorb back through the membrane on the next expansion cycle. The bag isn't getting wet from the outside — it's sweating from the *inside out*, from a place that doesn't technically have an inside yet.

This process of stabilization is known among artificers and enchanters as **curing**. A newly created Bag of Holding is colloquially called a **wet bag**, and the slick, pearlescent dampness that coats it is unmistakable — faintly cool to the touch, slightly viscous, and carrying the barest metallic tang that some describe as the smell of a lightning strike in an empty room. The curing process typically takes one to three weeks depending on the skill of the enchanter and the quality of the materials, though rushed or shoddy work can extend it to a month or more.

A wet bag is unreliable and somewhat dangerous to use. The oscillating membrane means the boundary between the pocket dimension and the material plane is inconsistent. Items placed inside may partially phase through the unstable membrane — a sword might come back three inches shorter, or with a thin rime of astral condensation on the blade. In more extreme cases, the pocket can briefly invert, dumping its contents into the Astral Plane entirely.

Once the curing process completes and the planar boundary fully stabilizes, the dampness ceases. The bag becomes **dry** and safe to use — the membrane locked in place, the sweating stopped, the pocket dimension firmly anchored. An artificer need only run a hand along the fabric to know whether a bag is ready; if the telltale slickness of astral condensate is still present, the bag goes back on the rack. Most reputable dealers will not sell a wet bag, though adventurers in a hurry have been known to buy them at a discount and simply wait.

## Usage by the Spellforged

The Spellforged have made extensive use of Bags of Holding throughout their adventures, employing them for everything from standard equipment storage to creative tactical applications. Tark used one to transport Ront through a flooded tunnel, and the bags have served as impromptu storage for rescued prisoners, valuable artifacts, and the enormous quantities of treasure the party has accumulated over their campaigns.
