---

Karsus was the most powerful archwizard of ancient Netheril and the creator of the only 12th-level spell ever cast, Karsus's Avatar. In his boundless ambition, Karsus attempted to steal the divine power of Mystryl, the goddess of magic, in order to save his people from the phaerimm threat. The spell succeeded momentarily, but the sudden transfer of power disrupted the Weave catastrophically, causing Mystryl to sacrifice herself and be reborn as Mystra. Without the Weave's support, the floating cities of Netheril crashed to the earth, ending the greatest magical empire the world had ever known.

Karsus's folly serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked magical ambition and the hubris of mortals who would challenge the gods. His petrified body is said to still exist somewhere in the Anauroch desert, weeping tears of stone for the civilization he destroyed.
