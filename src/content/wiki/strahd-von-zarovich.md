Strahd Von Zarovich is the vampire lord who rules the cursed demiplane of Barovia from his seat at Castle Ravenloft. An ancient and powerful undead, he is obsessed with Ireena — the latest reincarnation of his lost love Tatyana.

The party's journey through Barovia pits them against Strahd's machinations, his vampire court (including Ludmilla, Anastrasya, Volenta, Escher, and Peytr), and his servants such as the Shadow Abbot Gowain. The quest to defeat Strahd takes the party across Barovia — from the village to Vallaki, the Amber Temple, and finally Castle Ravenloft itself.
