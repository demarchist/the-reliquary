Strahd Von Zarovich is the vampire lord who rules the cursed demiplane of Barovia from his seat at Castle Ravenloft. An ancient and powerful undead, he is obsessed with Ireena — the latest reincarnation of his lost love Tatyana.

## The Man Beneath the Monster

The Tome of Strahd and Sergei's journal reveal a more complex figure than the valley's monster. Before his corruption, Strahd was a just and thoughtful king who loved his wife Tatyana and worried about his brother Sergei. His journal entries show a man who cared deeply about governance and family. The missing pages — torn from the Tome — conceal the period when Rahadin took him to the Amber Temple, where dark powers corrupted him. But the true catalyst was Rahadin's manipulation: the chamberlain murdered Tatyana, told Strahd that Sergei did it, and told Sergei that Strahd did it. Brother turned against brother. A good king was driven to become a monster, and the demiplane of Barovia was the prison built to contain the result.

## Court and Servants

Strahd's vampire court includes his brides Ludmilla, Anastrasya, Volenta, and the thralls Escher and Gertruda — all bound against their will. His enforcers are the enslaved vampire adventurers: Peytr the barbarian, Kenga the dwarven cleric, Beerna the half-orc, Growland the battlemaster, and Lelrin the moon-elf ranger. Lady Wachter serves as his political vassal in Vallaki, and the Shadow Abbot Gowain hunts his enemies.

## Encounters

When the group dined with Strahd, they saw both the elegant nobleman and the feral predator beneath. He offered freedom in exchange for the artifact shard, but the group could not accept unleashing a vampire army on the mortal world. When Patches confronted him with the truth of his past in the library, something in his ancient composure cracked. He screamed at them to leave — furious and wounded. Later, when blood was drawn at dinner and every vampire in the room lost control, Strahd's voice called from the darkness, begging them to flee while he held the blood-thirst at bay.

## Redemption

In the final battle, Ireena presented Sergei's journal in the chapel and Strahd was convinced of Rahadin's betrayal. He could not stop channelling the teleportation spell without destroying the castle, so he allowed Mordenkainen to take over. His rage at Rahadin was absolute — he tore the dragon's throat out with his bare claws, ignoring the Ashbringer's burning sunlight as he drank the traitor's blood. After the castle materialised in a desert at dawn, Strahd forced his entire undead army into the sunrise, then walked into the light himself. His last words to Cyrrus expressed doubt that any celestial would have him after all he had done, though he hoped for Lathander's forgiveness. The shadow aura burned away and Strahd was disintegrated, a massive vortex of darkness exploding from his remains before that too was consumed by the sun.
