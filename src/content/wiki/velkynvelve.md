Velkynvelve is a Drow outpost in the Underdark that controls access to the Darklake. The party is captured and imprisoned here by the Drow priestess Ilvara Mizzrym, marking the beginning of their harrowing journey through the Underdark.

Their escape from Velkynvelve — alongside fellow prisoners including the Kuo-Toa monk Shuushar, the myconid sprout Toadstool, and the derro Buppido — sets them on a long road through the subterranean world, eventually leading to Gracksuluth and Menzoberranzan.
