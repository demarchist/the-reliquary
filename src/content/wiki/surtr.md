Surtr is the lord of the fire giants, a being of immense power who embodies the destructive and transformative force of fire. In the giant Ordening, the divine caste system that governs all giantkind, Surtr stands among the highest, and fire giants revere him as the ultimate expression of martial and crafting prowess. His followers forge weapons of terrible power in the hearts of volcanoes and seek to burn the world in preparation for a final apocalyptic conflagration.

The party learned of Surtr's significance when negotiating with the Mountain Giant Bolg, who recognized that as a fire giant deity, Surtr ranked higher in the Ordening. This knowledge proved useful in convincing Bolg to join the Barony's forces as a mercenary.
