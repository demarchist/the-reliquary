Gneiss is an Earth Genasi warrior who serves as a retainer and bodyguard within the Amnian diplomatic delegation. A burly, formidable fighter armed with a lightning-infused halberd, Gneiss is one of the more honorable members of the Amnian contingent, alongside the monk Chani. The party first recognized both of them as the opponents they had fought during the Amnian Coup in Silverymoon, making their reunion at the Bumidere estate an uneasy one.

Despite their past conflict, Gneiss proved himself an ally when assassins attacked the estate during a diplomatic event. He fought ferociously in the ballroom, cleaving through assassins and shrugging off firebomb blasts, though he was eventually felled by poisoned crossbow bolts. JmJm later raised Gneiss from the dead using Raise Dead, an act of compassion that earned Chani's tearful gratitude and cemented the former enemies' alliance. Gneiss subsequently accompanied the party to the Barony, where he and Chani became trusted companions.
