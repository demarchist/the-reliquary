Harbin Wester is the Townmaster of Phandalin. During the Redbrand crisis, Sildar arranged a meeting with Harbin to discuss the situation in town. After the party cleared the Redbrands from Tresendar Manor and captured their leader Glasstaff, they brought the prisoner to Harbin, who took Iarno into custody and sent word to Sildar.
