## Description

The Sanctum of Krasus is an ancient Netherese tower hidden within the split mountain of Shatterpeak. Built during the height of Netherese civilization, it contains the incomplete Mythallar — a device originally designed to create floating cities — along with other powerful artifacts from that lost age.

## Significance

The Sanctum yields critical discoveries for the party, including the Mythallar, Crystal Tuning Fork, Netherese Medallions, and the Prismeum Core. The tower also contains Allip spirits (Striker and Tantalisia) and connects to the imprisoned entity Atropos in the Far Realm.
