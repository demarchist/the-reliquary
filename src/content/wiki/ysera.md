Ysera is patience made manifest. She first appeared as one of [[Moot]]'s seven golden canaries — tiny, cheerful, and inexplicably drawn to [[Tarkathee Daru|Tark]]. She chose to follow the monk, perching on his shoulder and chirping happily, granting him supernatural alertness and communicating with him telepathically in quiet moments. For sessions, she was just a bird. A peculiar, affectionate little bird that no one questioned too deeply.

The truth was staggering. Ysera is an Ancient Golden Dragon — one of the Disciples of [[Bahamut]], the dragon god of justice. She had been watching the group from the very beginning, tucked into the shape of something small and harmless, content to observe and protect from the shadows. Her bond with Tark specifically suggests she saw something in the blind monk worth guarding, though she has never explained what.

## Revelation

Ysera revealed herself during [[Kangaxx]]'s siege of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The golden lich hung in the sky above the burning docks, untouchable in his globe of invulnerability, exchanging fire with the Archmage and tearing open rifts to dark planes. The group was paralysed by indecision — half wanted to flee, half wanted to fight, and none of them had a plan.

Ysera fluttered up to Tark's face and spoke into his mind. She told him they had a chance. The meteor Kangaxx had called down was connected to the lich — destroy it, and Kangaxx could be destroyed. Then she launched herself skyward in a streak of gold and transformed. The tiny canary became a dragon of immense size and fury. She crashed into Kangaxx and knocked the lich from the sky, buying the group the time they needed to fight through the city and reach the crater.

The last the group saw of Ysera during the battle, she was knocked from the sky by a flash of orange light — but Kangaxx was destroyed moments later. Whether Ysera survived is unknown, but ancient golden dragons are not so easily killed.
