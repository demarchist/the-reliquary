Ysera first appears as one of Moot's seven golden canaries, taking a particular liking to Tark and deciding to follow him. She grants Tark the Alert feat while nearby and communicates with him telepathically.

Ysera is later revealed to be far more than a simple canary — she is an Ancient Golden Dragon allied with Bahamut, the dragon god of justice. Her true nature adds a profound dimension to her bond with Tark and hints at greater draconic involvement in the campaign's events.
