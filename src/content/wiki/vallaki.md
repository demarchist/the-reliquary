## Description

Vallaki is a fortified town situated on the far side of Barovia's mountain, offering its residents somewhat greater protection from Count Strahd's direct assaults. The town is surrounded by walls and guarded by Captain Boris Borison and his men.

## Significance

Vallaki serves as one of the party's primary bases during their time in Barovia. Despite its relative safety, the town suffers under the increasingly erratic rule of Burgomaster Vargas Vallakovich, whose desperate attempts to maintain order include public festivals, stockades, and executions. The town contains the Bluewater Inn and is notable for the Wolf's Head Jamboree Festival.
