The Svirfneblin, or deep gnomes, are a reclusive race of gnomes who dwell in the Underdark. Unlike their surface cousins, the Svirfneblin are somber and cautious, shaped by the constant dangers of subterranean life. They are skilled miners and gem-cutters, and their settlements are often hidden from the more aggressive races of the deep. Despite their wariness, the Svirfneblin are fundamentally good-natured and can become loyal allies to those who earn their trust.

The party forged a strong alliance with the Svirfneblin of Blingdenstone, helping to liberate the settlement from a lingering curse and the threat of oozes and undead in Rockblight. Under the leadership of Chief Diggermattock and High Priest Gurnik, the deep gnomes expressed gratitude through promises of trade negotiations with Selunia and a formal alliance with the Barony. The Svirfneblin twins who traveled with Gundren were among the earliest deep gnome allies the party gained.
