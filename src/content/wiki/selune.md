Selûné is the goddess of the moon, stars, navigation, navigators, wanderers, questers, and good-aligned lycanthropes. Known as Our Lady of Silver and the Moonmaiden, she is one of the oldest deities in the Faerûnian pantheon, having existed since the creation of the world. Her eternal conflict with her dark twin Shar has shaped much of the cosmos. Selûné's faithful are diverse, ranging from mariners to those who work by moonlight, and her clergy often provide comfort and guidance to travelers.

In the Rise of Atropos, Selûné holds particular importance as the deity worshipped by several members of the Spellforged Adventuring Company. Cirrus Al Kayan is a devoted cleric of Selûné, and the party has established the Fane of Selûné and the Cult of Selune as central pillars of their Barony. The town of Selunia itself is named in her honor, and the party's efforts to summon Selûné into the world through the Font of Fawden represent one of the campaign's most significant divine undertakings.
