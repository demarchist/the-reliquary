Rudjek was a vampire lord, referred to as a Shaa'barid (The Cold One), who ruled the city of Iyum in Al Askar with cruel tyranny. His reign was characterized by dark magic, torture, and the exploitation of his subjects, including maintaining a personal dungeon and hunting ground beneath a great pyramid. He worked alongside a Grand Vizier who served the Cult of the Black Skull, and together they created dark magical items in the Magi Tower.

Rudjek was eventually overthrown by the Usurpers of Rudjek, a resistance group led by Sultan Bashir. Killing the vampire required stabbing him in the heart with a magic weapon while in sunlight. Even after his death, Rudjek's legacy haunts Iyum: the dark Spire of his hunting ground looms as a constant reminder that the new government does not fully control the city, and the Pyramid of Rudjek remains an evil, unnaturally cold stain on the landscape that the party later hired mercenaries to secure.
