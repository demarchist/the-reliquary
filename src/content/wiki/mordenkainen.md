Mordenkainen is the legendary Archmage of Oerth, one of the most powerful wizards in the multiverse. He traveled to Barovia attempting to stop Strahd Von Zarovich but was afflicted by magical insanity, leaving him diminished and in need of rescue.

His Staff of the Archmagi — known simply as "Stick" — is guarded by the arcanaloth Nefron in the Amber Temple. Mordenkainen later establishes a pocket plane sanctum on Mt. Baratok and continues to play a role in the broader conflict against the cosmic threats facing the multiverse.
