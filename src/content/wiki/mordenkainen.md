Mordenkainen is the legendary Archmage of Oerth, one of the most powerful wizards in the multiverse. He travelled to Barovia attempting to stop Strahd Von Zarovich but was afflicted by magical insanity, leaving him diminished and wandering the wilderness until the party found him.

## Recovery

The group discovered the mad archmage and helped restore his faculties. His Staff of the Archmagi — a sentient artifact known as "Stick" — was recovered from the arcanaloth Nefron in the Amber Temple. Reunited with his staff, Mordenkainen established a sanctum on Mount Baratok and became the group's most powerful ally for the Barovia endgame.

## The Final Battle

Mordenkainen's contributions were decisive. He cast Mind Blank on Patches to protect her from the Reaver's curse, destroyed the Amber Temple to deny its power to Strahd, brewed potions of vitality to restore the exhausted group, and planned the strategy of redirecting the castle's teleportation to a desert at dawn. During the assault on Castle Ravenloft, he sustained a witch bolt for the entire battle to breach two sets of warded copper doors leading to the chapel, feeding his own life force into the spell until it left him blistered and bleeding. He then took over Strahd's teleportation casting so the vampire lord could confront Rahadin — holding together a spell of immense power while badly wounded.

## Personality

Mordenkainen is imperious and impatient — he reduced JmJm's animated bookcase without hesitation when it could not fit through a door, and cast spells with a casual mastery that reminded the group they were in the presence of a living legend. His relationship with Stick is one of fond exasperation; the sentient staff is flirtatious, excitable, and announces its movements with telepathic sound effects. After the battle, Mordenkainen slumped to the floor, said he needed to sleep for a month, and departed to Oerth — promising to replace the lost sending stone and stay in contact about the larger cosmic threats.
