Vaasa is a cold, desolate land in the far northeast of Faerûn, bordering the kingdom of Damara to the south. It is a bleak and inhospitable region of frozen tundra and barren rock, made famous as the domain of the lich Zhengyi the Witch-King, who ruled it with armies of undead and monstrous creatures. Even after Zhengyi's defeat, Vaasa remains a dangerous and sparsely populated land haunted by the remnants of his dark rule.

The spell cast by Theodemir that sealed Zhengyi has been failing, and Vaasa stands as the most likely staging ground for the Witch-King's return. Should the seal break entirely, Zhengyi's undead armies would pour forth from Vaasa to threaten Damara and the wider North, making the party's efforts to contain this threat critical to the survival of the northern kingdoms.
