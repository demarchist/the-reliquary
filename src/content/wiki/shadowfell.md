The Shadowfell is a dark, twisted reflection of the Material Plane, a realm of shadow, despair, and undeath. Colors are muted, light is dim, and an oppressive sense of melancholy pervades everything. It is the domain of the goddess Shar and serves as a waypoint for souls of the dead traveling to their final resting places. The Shadowfell overlaps with the Material Plane in places where darkness and death hold sway, and powerful necromancers draw upon its energies.

The Shadowfell's influence has been felt throughout the campaign, particularly in Barovia, which exists as a demiplane connected to the Shadowfell's dark energies. In Al Askar, Shadowfell creatures guarded the temples of the gods, and the party had to contend with undead forces empowered by the plane's necrotic energies during their quest to stop Vecna.
