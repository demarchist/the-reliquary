Moogie is a half-elf ranger who has lived in the Thunder Bluff region for longer than most of its current inhabitants can remember. She walks the roads with her wolfhound Charles, presenting herself as a frail old woman to travellers — an act she drops the moment she decides they are trustworthy.

She was the first person the group met upon arriving at their newly awarded barony, and she proved invaluable as a guide. Moogie carries a detailed knowledge of the local geography — the ruined castle of High Hold (Moorwatch), the villages of Kossenberg and Old Kossenberg, Lake Selûna, the Red Hill and its iron deposits, the Glittering Caves, and the ancient menhir called Oldstone. She had explored the cave system beneath the bluff several thousand feet deep before turning back at the boundary of the Upper-Dark.

What sets Moogie apart is her pragmatic decency. She remembers a century of peaceful coexistence between the region's humans and orcs before the Horde's invasion, and she judges the Orc deserters sheltering in High Hold by their character rather than their race. When the group negotiated citizenship for Luumsh's tribe instead of fighting them, Moogie approved — and volunteered to handle the delicate work of breaking the news to Kossenberg's human residents over the coming months.
