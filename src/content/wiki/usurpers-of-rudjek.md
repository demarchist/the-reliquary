## Overview

The Usurpers of Rudjek are a revolutionary faction that successfully overthrew Rudjek, a tyrannical vampire lord who ruled the city of Iyum in Al Askar. Now led by Sultan Bashir, they have established a new government and work to rebuild their society.

## Leadership

Sultan Bashir serves as the primary ruler, supported by Grand Warden Djoser (military), the priestess Liara (religious), and Captain Ime (law enforcement through the Wardens of Iyum).

## Goals

The Usurpers seek to strengthen Iyum's independence, purge remaining undead influences, and combat the Cult of Zalaam that threatens the stability they fought to achieve.
