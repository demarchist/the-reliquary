Selunia is the settlement at the heart of the Barony of Thunder Bluff, named in honor of the goddess Selûné. Built around Lake Selunia and anchored by Feanon's Tower and the Keep of Thunder Bluff, the town has grown from a frontier outpost into a thriving community under the stewardship of the Spellforged Adventuring Company. Lord Neverember designated Selunia as a base of operations, sending a garrison and resources to support its development.

The town sits in a scenic location where sunlight gleams off the lake and the rolling landscape stretches to the borders of the Moonwood and the Evermoors. Local life includes festivals honoring Lathander, taverns like Over the Moon where residents gather, and the presence of notable figures such as Beryan the Sage. Freed slaves from across the North have made their way to Selunia, drawn by the promise of a fresh start under the party's protection.
