S'Olaa is Cirrus al-Kayan's brother and the current head of the Al'Kayan clan — a position he attained after Cyrrus killed their father. A well-dressed, sharp-looking Amnian with neatly trimmed hair and a precisely cut beard, he serves as apprentice to the Archmage Shaahir and operates as an agent of Amnian interests within Silverymoon.

When Cyrrus infiltrated the Amnian embassy seeking intelligence during the lead-up to the invasion, S'Olaa descended the foyer stairs to meet him. His greeting was chilling in its casualness: he thanked Cyrrus for killing their father, remarking that he had been waiting years to take over the family. In the same breath, he declared that he had no desire to know another brother — "much less a freak Tiefling" — and dismissed Cyrrus with a confident smirk.

The encounter crystallised the Al'Kayan family dynamics: a clan of calculating Amnian nobility where patricide is merely an opportunity and family bonds are a liability. S'Olaa escaped Silverymoon with Shaahir and the other Amnian leaders when the coup collapsed, fleeing by flight potion as the Mythal Golems converged on the plaza.
