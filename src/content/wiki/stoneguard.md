The Stoneguard are the primary military and law enforcement force of Gracklstugh, the great Duergar city in the Underdark. Clad in heavy armor and wielding brutal weapons including hooked cleavers and crossbows, the Stoneguard maintain order through intimidation, force, and a vast network of checkpoints throughout the city. They operate alongside the Flameguard, another military faction, and their captain Errde Blackskull commands significant political power.

The party had numerous encounters with the Stoneguard during their time in Gracklstugh. The guards monitored the group's movements, offered mercenary work, and were involved in a raid on Veygar's operations that captured Hemeth and Velka. The Stoneguard's checkpoint system made moving through the city a constant exercise in diplomacy and subterfuge, with the party's golden badges providing passage through most barriers. During the demonic incursions, the Stoneguard fought alongside the party to hold defensive positions.
