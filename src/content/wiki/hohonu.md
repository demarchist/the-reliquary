Hohonu Hāmau is an ancient dragon from the earliest age of Al Askar, when the gods still walked the earth. Sealed long ago within a Greater Magic Circle and contained by an Antipathy spell along with other binding enchantments, Hohonu's prison has weakened over the centuries. Corrupted halflings worship Hohonu as a god, performing blood sacrifices at an altar built over the tar pit that marks his prison, their devotion slowly eroding the magical seals.

The party intervened when Camea's people asked for help preventing Hohonu's awakening. Fëanon's research revealed the dragon's history and the nature of his bindings, allowing the party to plan their assault. During the battle, the group destroyed Hohonu's altar by dropping it into the tar pit, severing the power conduit that kept the Grand Shaman alive. From his prison in the Ethereal Plane, Hohonu reached out to tempt each party member with their deepest desires in exchange for freedom, but none accepted. Though not fully destroyed, Hohonu's rising was prevented and the party planned to return with dragon allies to put him down permanently.
