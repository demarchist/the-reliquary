## Description

The Bog is a vast, otherworldly swamp that exists beneath the Tavern of Doors. This strange landscape is populated by sentient mushrooms, bizarre creatures, and scattered ruins from forgotten ages. Goblin Town sits within the Bog, along with the constantly rearranging Labyrinth.

## Significance

The party ventures into the Bog to pursue the Goblin King and rescue JmJm's mind. Traversing the Bog proves hazardous — riding through it on magical mounts inflicts a curse that causes mutations including tails, tentacles, fungus growths, and shrinking.
