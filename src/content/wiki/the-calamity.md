## Overview

The Calamity refers to a cataclysmic conflict that occurred approximately one thousand years before the present day, when the ancient Saurian civilization waged a devastating war against the Phaerimm. The conflict resulted in the complete destruction of the Saurian world and their civilization.

## Legacy

The Calamity left behind ruins, artifacts, and magical remnants scattered across multiple planes. The Ringed Veils network, Machina Factories, Firelances, and other Saurian technologies survived the destruction, becoming sources of immense power and danger for those who discover them.

## Current Relevance

The party's encounters with Saurian artifacts and the scholar Hasrala directly connect to The Calamity's legacy. The Phaerimm threat persists, with evidence of their presence found even in Faerûn.
