## Background

Luumsh is an Orc tribal leader who has established his tribe in the ruins of High-Hold (Moorwatch) castle. He leads through strength and pragmatism rather than pure aggression.

## Role in the Campaign

The party negotiates with Luumsh rather than simply fighting through his forces, finding a pragmatic leader willing to discuss terms. His occupation of High-Hold connects to the broader political landscape of the Thunder Bluff barony.

## Notable Traits

- Pragmatic Orc leader open to negotiation
- Supported by the shaman Keek, an old Lady-Orc of Luthic
- Has established a functioning settlement in the castle ruins
