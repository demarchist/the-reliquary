## Description

Goblin Town is a chaotic, sprawling settlement located in the Bog beneath the Tavern of Doors. It features docks, a central tower, a magical cauldron shop, and a mushroom inn run by the huge malk Demetrius. The settlement is populated by goblins of all varieties and ruled by the Goblin King.

## Significance

The party ventures into Goblin Town to rescue JmJm's mind from the Goblin King, who consumed it and seeks to use JmJm's body to access the prime material plane. Notable inhabitants include Foxy Crazy, a hedgehog-like goblin lady, and a halfling version of JmJm's butler Steven.
