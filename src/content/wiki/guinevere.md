Guinevere is an astoundingly sophisticated clockwork lion built by Gundren Rockseeker — his magnum opus and crowning achievement as an Artificer. She is the envy of Artificers the world over.

## Loyalty

Guinevere is absolutely loyal to Gundren and obeys his every command. She accompanies him at all times, serving as both companion and fearsome combatant.

## Appearance

To those unfamiliar with Gundren, Guinevere can appear terrifying — glowing, intelligent red-gem eyes staring out from a conglomeration of threshing blades, snicking gears, and armor plates. The clockwork lion is a marvel of both engineering and arcane artifice.
