Sildar is a hired hand and good friend of Gundren Rockseeker, as well as a Gauntlet Agent. He was captured alongside Gundren by goblins at the Cragmaw Hideout and rescued by the party early in their adventures.

Sildar assists the party throughout their time in Phandalin and accompanies them on their journey toward Neverwinter. His loyalty to Gundren and his connections as a Gauntlet Agent make him a valuable ally in the party's early days.
