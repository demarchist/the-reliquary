Gracksuluth is the major Duergar capital city of the Underdark, also known as the Dark Iron City. It is a sprawling stronghold divided by Ladueger's Furrow — a massive chasm running through its center — and home to various districts including the Blade Bazaar (the largest market), the Darklake District for foreign traders, and the West Cleft derro ghetto.

The city is patrolled by the Flameguard military and Stoneguard police forces. Foreigners are housed in the Gholbrorn's Lair complex. The party spends considerable time in Gracksuluth during their Underdark campaign, navigating its politics, the Grey Ghosts thieves' guild, and the Council of Derro Savants.
