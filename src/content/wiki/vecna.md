Vecna, the Whispered One, is the god of secrets, necromancy, and undeath. Once a mortal wizard of unsurpassed ambition, Vecna achieved lichdom and eventually ascended to godhood through sheer force of will and dark magic. He is known for his missing hand and eye, which were severed by his treacherous lieutenant Kas and became powerful artifacts in their own right. His followers seek forbidden knowledge and guard terrible secrets.

In Al Askar, Vecna's threat is existential. Operating through the guise of Zalaam, he has been systematically devouring the gods of that world, consuming the deity Zalaam entirely and slowly absorbing the goddess Fawden. His machinations drove much of the party's quest on Al Askar, as they raced to deny him the power of the remaining gods and prevent his complete domination of that plane.
