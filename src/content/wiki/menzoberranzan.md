Menzoberranzan is the great Drow capital city of the Underdark — a vast metropolis of black stone with intricate Drow architecture, dominated by the competing noble houses. The great magical clock tower of Narbondellyn glows red-hot and is visible across the entire cavern.

The city is the seat of House Baenre (the ruling house whose archmage Gromph summoned the Demon Lords), House Faen Tlabbar (connected to Patches' family), and numerous other noble houses locked in constant political intrigue. Bregan D'aerthe operates in the shadows outside the official power structure.

The party's journey to Menzoberranzan is driven by the quest to rescue Finn (Patches' son) and to participate in the ritual to banish the Demon Lords from the Underdark.
