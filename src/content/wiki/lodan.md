Lo'Dan is the kind of person who is never doing just one thing. A Drow operative leading [[Bregan D'aerthe]]'s regional operations, he appears throughout the campaign as employer, informant, co-belligerent, and spy — sometimes all at once. He is pragmatic to the bone, never sentimental, and always calculating the angle that benefits Bregan D'aerthe first and everything else second.

## First Contact

Lo'Dan first appeared in Wave Echo Cave, buying [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] from captivity — a transaction that immediately established his operating style. He does not rescue people; he acquires assets. He later hired the party to reclaim the celestial vault beneath Neverwinter's Chasm, a mission that served Bregan D'aerthe's interests while conveniently putting the group in the path of [[Kangaxx]].

## The Chasm

When Kangaxx revealed his true nature and the vault collapsed, Lo'Dan intervened — not out of loyalty, but because the golden lich was a threat to his operations. His forces fought alongside the group, and [[Kimmuriel]]'s psionic teleportation provided the escape route that saved their lives. Lo'Dan's assistance was real, but so were his ulterior motives.

## Double Agent

Lo'Dan serves at least two masters beyond Bregan D'aerthe. He reports to [[Jarlaxle]], the mercenary company's enigmatic leader, but he was also revealed to be spying on [[Aliyah Faen Tlabbar|Patches]] for her mother [[Vladalma]], the Matron Mother of [[House Faen Tlabbar]]. Whether Lo'Dan's true loyalty lies with Jarlaxle, Vladalma, or simply with his own survival is a question the group has never been able to answer — and Lo'Dan seems to prefer it that way.
