Lo'Dan is the leader of Bregan D'aerthe operations in the region. He first appears buying Gundren in Wave Echo Cave, later hiring the party to reclaim the Chasm vault beneath Neverwinter.

Lo'Dan operates as a pragmatic spymaster, maintaining a complex relationship with the party — sometimes ally, sometimes employer, always serving Bregan D'aerthe's interests. He ultimately intervenes against Kangaxx and uses Kimmuriel's psionic teleportation to help the group escape the collapsing celestial vault.
