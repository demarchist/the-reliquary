The Amber Temple is an ancient structure built high on Mt. Ghakis in Barovia, serving as a prison for dark powers — shards of the malevolent entity Atropos. The temple contains amber sarcophagi housing these imprisoned entities, which offer immense power to those willing to sacrifice their souls.

The temple is guarded by the ancient, senile lich Exethanter and houses the arcanaloth Nefron, who guards Mordenkainen's Staff of the Archmagi. The party's expedition to the Amber Temple reveals crucial connections between Atropos, the Dark Powers, and the overarching threat facing the world.
