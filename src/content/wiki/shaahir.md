Shaahir is a powerful Amnian Archmage from Athkatla, identified by his distinctive solid gold staff. He arrived in Silverymoon three days before the coup with his apprentice S'Olaa — Cyrrus's brother — and served as the primary magical asset in the Amnian invasion.

While the army marched through the western gate and the Amnian champions fought the group in the Plaza of the Watchers, Shaahir led a separate and arguably more dangerous operation: a direct assault on the Palace of Silverymoon, targeting the Senior Council itself. The attack was devastating — powerful spells slagged walls, blasted through floors and turned some of the Sundabarian dwarves trapped inside to stone. A massive hole was punched through all three floors. Lances of ruby energy crackled into the sky.

When the Palace assault failed — the Senior Council ultimately surviving and counterattacking — Shaahir was among the dozen figures seen flying east out of the city, abandoning the army he had helped bring to slaughter. The Amnian champions in the plaza downed flight potions and followed his lead moments later.

His robed figure was also present at the head of the Amnian column that marched through the western gate at dawn. When Cyrrus threw up a Wall of Force across the gate, the mage at the column's head disintegrated it with a single spell — likely Shaahir himself, given the power displayed.
