Gowain, known as the Shadow Abbot, is a tall, leather-clad servant of Strahd Von Zarovich driven to madness. Possessing teleportation abilities, he relentlessly hunts the party throughout Barovia, appearing when least expected.

## The Feast of St. Andral

Gowain orchestrated the Feast of St. Andral — a devastating attack on Vallaki involving a coordinated vampire assault. He murdered the priest Lucien of Lathander and commanded the enslaved vampire adventurers in a massive battle through the streets. The fight was chaotic and brutal, with the party defending the town against waves of undead while Gowain teleported between positions to direct the carnage.

## Death

Strahd Von Zarovich personally killed Gowain during the Feast of St. Andral, apparently displeased with the servant's lack of restraint or the damage to his holdings. The vampire lord's willingness to destroy his own agent in front of the party demonstrated both his power and his unpredictability — a reminder that Strahd's court operated under rules the group did not fully understand.
