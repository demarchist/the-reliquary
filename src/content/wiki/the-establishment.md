The Establishment is a bustling underworld commercial complex located at a crossroads within the Barony of Thunder Bluff. It is owned and operated by Aliyah Faen Tlabbar, who uses it both as a business venture and as a way to cement her network of connections among the shady underbelly of the region.

## Layout

The Establishment is a conglomeration of inn, brothel, and casino. Its labyrinthine layout and subdued lighting make it an ideal place for covert planning and meetings. The Faerûn Defense Force often uses it as a base of operations for their missions.

## Culture

The Establishment is a popular gathering place for members of the criminal underworld — a place where deals are made, secrets are traded, and alliances are formed. Aliyah enforces a strict code of conduct and does not tolerate violence or illegal activities within its walls.

Despite its reputation as a den of iniquity, The Establishment serves a valuable function within the Barony by providing a neutral ground where members of the criminal underworld can conduct business without resorting to violence, helping keep the streets of the barony safe.
