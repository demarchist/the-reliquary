Lord Dagult Neverember is the Lord of Neverwinter and Buumi's uncle. He rewards the party 2,000 gold for destroying Venomfang and commissions them to investigate the Chasm beneath the ruined section of Neverwinter.

Neverember officially founds the Spellforged Adventuring Company under his writ of patronage, giving the party the authority to accept questing contracts from bounty boards throughout the region. His political connections and resources make him a powerful — if sometimes demanding — patron.
