Juiblex, the Faceless Lord, is the demon lord of oozes, slimes, and all manner of amorphous abominations. Unlike other demon lords who scheme and plot with cunning intelligence, Juiblex is a being of pure dissolution, seeking only to consume and absorb all matter into its formless bulk. Its layer of the Abyss is a festering swamp of acidic slime, and its followers are among the most deranged cultists in existence, worshipping the concept of dissolution itself.

Juiblex's influence was felt during the demonic incursions in the Underdark, where the boundaries between the Abyss and the Material Plane grew dangerously thin. The presence of oozes and slimes in the deep tunnels served as a constant reminder of the Faceless Lord's corrupting reach.
