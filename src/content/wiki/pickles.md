Mr. Pickles is a blue goblin who serves as a loyal servant and companion to Patches (Aliyah Faen Tlabbar) and the Spellforged Adventuring Company. First encountered working as a drink-carrying servant, Mr. Pickles was killed by a startled Tark but promptly revived by Buumi's Lay on Hands, after which the resilient goblin simply got right back to work. This inauspicious introduction belied the deep loyalty Mr. Pickles would show the party over the course of their adventures.

Mr. Pickles has served in a variety of roles, from running errands and delivering messages to leading groups of dwarven miners back to the Barony. Despite his small stature and limited combat ability, he has accompanied the party through Barovia, the Underdark, and beyond, often being sent on escort missions or carrying out tasks that require discretion. His unwavering dedication makes him one of the Spellforged's most enduring companions.
