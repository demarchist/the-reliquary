Shuushar is a kuo-toa who introduces himself to the party as a pacifist, a remarkable rarity among his violent and superstitious kind. Known as Shuushar the Awakened, he accompanies the Myconid companion Toadstool and guided the party toward the Darklake and his people's settlement at Sloobludop after their escape from Velkynvelve. Despite the chaos erupting around him, Shuushar maintained his commitment to nonviolence, preferring to stand and watch during combat encounters.

During the demon attack on Sloobludop, Shuushar rallied his fellow kuo-toa around the Idol of the Sea Mother, leading them in prayer. The sanctuary spell emanating from their meditation pushed back an attacking demon. Shuushar also demonstrated keen perception, seeing through an Incubus disguised as a kuo-toa that was manipulating Ront. After the battle, he thanked Doc B. for her Plant Growth spell that would enrich the local ecosystem, showing his connection to his community's wellbeing.
