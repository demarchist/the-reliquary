Neverwinter is a major city on the Sword Coast, overlooked by a dormant volcano. The city is scarred by a massive chasm that splits its ruined section — a crevasse sealed by magical wards that descends deep underground into spider nests, undead-filled tunnels, and an ancient celestial vault.

The party arrives during the Refounding Festival, a celebration of Neverwinter's independence from the Thayans and Netherese. The festival features tournament combat, archery competitions, a bards stage, merchant pavilions, and gambling — though it is disrupted by a coordinated cultist assault. Lord Dagult Neverember rules the city and commissions the party to investigate the Chasm.
