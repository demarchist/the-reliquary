Carp Alderleaf is a halfling child living in Phandalin. He discovered a secret tunnel leading into the caverns beneath Tresendar Manor — the Redbrand Ruffians' hideout. When the party heard rumors of the tunnel at the Stonehill Inn, they tracked down Carp and followed his directions to the hidden passage, using it to infiltrate the manor and clear out the bandits.
