Lady Faye is a noblewoman in Baldur's Gate who serves as [[Aliyah Faen Tlabbar|Patches]]' benefactor and employer. She commands a network of champions — including Patches and the Moon Elf warrior [[Zhink]] — and maintains connections throughout the city's upper society.

## The Vault Job

Lady Faye hired the Spellforged to infiltrate Lord Fendrel's vault as a test of its security system, presenting the mission through her associate Lord Hufflebram. The job was accessed through a masquerade party at the lord's manor. However, the entire operation turned out to be a Duergar trap — the deep dwarf [[Veygar]] had been impersonating Lord Faendral, and both Lady Faye and Patches were captured and held as bait in the deepest chamber of the ancient ruins beneath the estate.

The group fought through the ruins, battled Veygar's forces, and ultimately rescued both Lady Faye and Patches. Patches later sent a letter to Lady Faye from the Baldur's Gate docks upon the group's initial arrival in the city, suggesting an ongoing correspondence and reporting relationship.

## Champions

Lady Faye employs champions to carry out her interests. Patches serves as one such champion, and Zhink — an eccentric Moon Elf warrior — serves as another. The full scope of Lady Faye's influence and the nature of her operations remain unclear to the rest of the group, though her connections in Baldur's Gate's upper society are considerable.
