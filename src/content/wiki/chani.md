Chani is a human monk who serves as a retainer and bodyguard within the Amnian diplomatic delegation, working alongside the Earth Genasi warrior Gneiss. Alert and disciplined, Chani is a skilled martial artist who fights with her fists and a quarterstaff. The party first encountered her and Gneiss as opponents during the Amnian Coup in Silverymoon before meeting them again under diplomatic circumstances at the Bumidere estate.

During the assassin attack on the estate, Chani fought bravely, deflecting crossbow bolts and overwhelming enemies with her flurry of blows. When Gneiss was killed by poisoned bolts, Chani was devastated, sobbing into his arms after JmJm raised him from the dead. She later traveled with the party to the Barony of Selunia, where she and Gneiss became regular companions, often spending time with other party members like Snorbul. JmJm's persistent flirtation with Chani is a running source of tension, with Gneiss having admonished the bard for being "creepy" toward her.
