A piwafwi is a dark cloak of elvenkind crafted by the drow, enchanted to enhance the wearer's ability to hide and move unseen. These cloaks are standard equipment for drow warriors and scouts, complementing their natural affinity for darkness and stealth. The magic woven into a piwafwi helps the wearer blend into shadows and move silently, making them nearly invisible in the dimly lit tunnels of the Underdark.

Piwafwi cloaks are prized possessions among the drow and are sometimes taken as trophies by surface dwellers who manage to defeat their original owners. The cloaks' enchantments are tied to the Underdark's unique magical properties, and some lose their power when exposed to prolonged sunlight, a limitation that reflects the drow's own vulnerability to the surface world.
