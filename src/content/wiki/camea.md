Camea is a halfling shaman from Al Askar who served as the party's guide through the dangerous wilderness of that world. Knowledgeable about the local geography, she led the group across the Great River to Aina Pulu and helped them navigate the ruins and swamplands. Her people have been suffering under the influence of the dark entity Hohonu, whose corrupted worshippers have brought violence and chaos to the halfling communities.

Camea proved her courage by accompanying the party into the ruins where Hohonu's followers gathered, even posing as a captor presenting the disguised Patches and Tark as prisoners to infiltrate the enemy. During the battle against Hohonu's forces, Camea was killed when her soul was pulled toward the Death Wyrm's vortex, but Tark managed to grab her soul in the Ethereal Plane and store it in a waterskin. The party revived her with a diamond, and a shaken Camea later negotiated on behalf of her people, maintaining contact with the group through magic.
