Longsaddle is a wizard town located three days' travel from Phandalin, home to the Harpell Family and their estate, Ivy Mansion. The town is a hub of arcane learning and eccentric magical experimentation.

The party visits Longsaddle to have a wardstone crafted by the Harpells and Gundren, and receives the Megascope communication device. It is also here that Harkell Harpell accidentally summons a Balgura demon whose dying prophecy foreshadows the campaign's central threat from Orcus.
