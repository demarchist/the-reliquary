Yeenoghu is the demon lord of gnolls, a towering beast of carnage and destruction who embodies the savage hunger of the pack. He wields a massive triple-headed flail and commands hordes of gnolls, hyenas, and other bestial servants. Gnolls are said to have been created when hyenas fed on the corpses left in Yeenoghu's wake as he rampaged across the Material Plane, transforming into the first of their kind through exposure to his abyssal corruption.

The party encountered gnolls influenced by Yeenoghu's savage nature during their travels, particularly in the wilderness around the Barony where gnoll war bands posed a persistent threat to settlers and travelers.
