Kossenberg is a village that lies to the north of Thunder Bluff, nestled at the base of the magical forest known as the Moonwood. It is the primary settlement within the Barony of Thunder Bluff and the home of most of the region's human population.

## Old Kossenberg

At the base of the bluff itself lie the ruins of Old Kossenberg — the original town, destroyed two years prior by the Orcish Horde during its devastating sweep through the region. The ruins were offered by the group as a settlement site for Luumsh's tribe of Orc deserters, with the ranger Moogie volunteering to break the news to Kossenberg's current residents over the coming months. A century of peaceful coexistence between humans and orcs in the region prior to the Horde's invasion gives some hope that the arrangement can work.

## Surrounding Landmarks

The barony's other notable features include Lake Selûna and its ranger lodge, the Red Hill with its iron deposits and the Glittering Caves beneath, and Oldstone — a sacred menhir older than local memory.
