---

The Derro are a race of dwarf-kin who dwell in the deepest reaches of the Underdark, known for their collective madness and unpredictable behavior. Descended from dwarves subjected to mind flayer experiments in ages past, the Derro are paranoid, sadistic, and prone to delusions of grandeur. They organize themselves under the Council of Savants, a body of warlocks with patrons ranging from Archfey to Demons and Devils, who cooperate when convenient but readily betray one another.

In Gracklstugh, the Derro occupy the West Cleft and other marginal areas of the city, operating in the shadows of Duergar society. The party was tasked with capturing the Derro courier Droki, which led them into the complex underworld of Derro politics and the Whorlstone Caverns. Multiple Derro factions were observed operating in the city, each with its own agenda, making them a wildcard element in the already volatile politics of the Dark Iron City.
