Lady Fiona Wachter is a noblewoman of Vallaki and a practising necromancer who openly opposes Burgomaster Vargas Vallakovich. She leads a faction seeking to overthrow the Burgomaster, believing accommodation with Strahd Von Zarovich is preferable to tyranny, forced festivals, and oppression. Cunning and politically shrewd, she cultivates allies among the discontented citizens while maintaining a devil-summoning circle in her basement.

## In Vallaki

Patches asked Lady Wachter at the dinner with Strahd how her husband was doing — a pointed question that froze the woman mid-stride and earned a venomous glare. Cyrrus publicly accused her of orchestrating the attempt to kill Ireena, but Strahd sided with his vassal in a case of word against word.

## The Final Battle

Lady Wachter served as Rahadin's last line of defence at the gates of Castle Ravenloft, commanding waves of skeleton warriors and a zombie ogre. She wielded significant necromantic power — summoning a cloudkill that enveloped JmJm, a Bigby construct, and repeated skeleton reinforcements. But every spell she threw was countered or destroyed: Fëanon's fireball incinerated her first skeleton wave, Cyrrus dispelled her construct, and Gwen's lightning bolt shattered her ogre and blasted through the skeletons to hit her directly.

Her composure disintegrated as the battle turned. She began frothing at the mouth, screaming insults, and launching increasingly desperate spells. Gwen leapt from concealment and sank mithril teeth into her hamstring. She pointed a finger of death at Fëanon — he batted it aside with his staff in a shower of green sparks. Bleeding, foam-mouthed, and raging, Lady Wachter saw her last aspiration dissolve as Fëanon's fireball washed over both her and Rahadin, burning the necromancer of Vallaki to death.
