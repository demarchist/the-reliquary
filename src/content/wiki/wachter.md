Lady Fiona Wachter is a noblewoman of Vallaki who openly opposes Burgomaster Vargas Vallakovich and his tyrannical rule. She leads a faction within the town that seeks to overthrow the Burgomaster, believing that accommodation with Strahd Von Zarovich is preferable to the current regime of forced festivals and oppression. Lady Wachter is cunning and politically shrewd, cultivating allies among the discontented citizens of Vallaki.

The party encountered Lady Wachter during their time in Barovia, where the political tensions of Vallaki added another layer of complexity to their already dangerous situation. Her opposition to the Burgomaster created opportunities and complications for the Spellforged as they navigated the treacherous politics of the town while pursuing their larger goals of confronting Strahd and his servants.
