Venomfang is a young green dragon who resides in the old mage's tower of Thundertree. Cunning and deceitful, he initially tricks the party and nearly kills them during their first encounter.

Venomfang later attacks Phandalin, where he is slain — only to rise again as a Dracolich with a glowing orange gemstone heart. His necrotic breath kills half the town's population and raises them as zombies. The party ultimately destroys the Dracolich and claims its phylactery, but the devastation of Phandalin is catastrophic.
