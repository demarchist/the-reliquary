Anduriel is a Planetar — a powerful celestial servant of Lathander — who has lived for centuries in the walled village of Krezk, disguised as the Abbot of the Abbey of St. Markovia. Behind the guise of a mortal clergyman, he conceals six cream-feathered wings and softly glowing blue eyes.

## The Abbey

During his long vigil in Krezk, Anduriel constructed a flesh golem in the likeness of Ireena — a hollow, emotionless replica intended as a gift for Strahd, though the angel's true motivations remain unclear. When Mordenkainen detected a celestial presence in Krezk during his research on the crystal blade, the group sought out the Abbot and found Anduriel instead.

## The Sacrifice

The crystal greatsword recovered from Sergei's tomb was powerless — a celestial artifact whose divine spark had been extinguished. Reforging it required a terrible price: the death of a celestial, its grace drawn fully into the blade. Anduriel refused. The group argued. The angel held firm.

Then he turned and saw the Wild Hunt bearing down on Krezk — an army of darkness that would overwhelm even a Planetar. He relented. He presented his chest and told Tark to impale him.

Tark drove the blade through the angel. Glowing cracks spread across Anduriel's form as his essence flowed into the sword. The process was agonisingly slow, and the group fought wave after wave of the Wild Hunt to buy time. When Anduriel finally exploded, the beacon of Argynvostholt streaked across the valley and poured into the weapon, which blazed with sunlight and named itself: the Ashbringer.

The spirit of Anduriel later appeared as a golden halo around Patches during the final battle against Rahadin, speaking through her to condemn the corrupted dragon before departing to the afterlife.
