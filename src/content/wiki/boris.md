Boris Goodsman was a resident of Neverwinter and the husband of Della Goodsman, who owns a general store by the rift. He became the most recent victim of the serial killer known as the "Red Grin Killer," found dead in an alleyway with all his teeth ripped from his skull and his lips missing, matching the pattern of 43 other victims. In the days before his death, Boris suffered from vivid night terrors of being burned alive, which connected to a childhood trauma of escaping a burning building.

The party investigated Boris's murder as part of their efforts to track down the Red Grin Killer. Della provided details about her husband's nightmares, and the group searched the alleyway where his body was found. Fey discovered a long, stringy hair matching the warlock responsible for the killings, which served as a focus for scrying to locate the murderer.
