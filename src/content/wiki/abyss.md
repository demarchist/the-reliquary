The Abyss is an infinite plane of chaos and evil, comprised of countless layers each more horrifying than the last. It is the home of demons and their lords, from the relatively minor dretch and manes to the terrifyingly powerful demon princes like Demogorgon, Orcus, Baphomet, and Juiblex. Each demon lord claims one or more layers as their domain, and the constant warfare between them prevents any single entity from conquering the whole.

The Abyss has been a persistent source of danger throughout the campaign. The demonic incursions in the Underdark drew power from the Abyss as the boundaries between planes weakened, and multiple demon lords have had direct or indirect influence on the party's adventures. Orcus, the Goat Prince, has been a particularly significant threat, with his agents and cultists working to spread undeath across the Realms.
