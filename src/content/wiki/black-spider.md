The Black Spider is a Drow agent who orchestrated much of the villainy surrounding Phandalin in the early days of the campaign. Operating through noble connections in Neverwinter, the Spider recruited Iarno (Glasstaff) to form the Redbrand Ruffians, sent bugbears to assist the operation, and directed the Cragmaw goblins — including the bugbear Klarg — to kidnap Gundren Rockseeker.

The Spider's ultimate goal was to locate and seize the Spellforge within Wave Echo Cave. Gundren had discovered the cave's location, making him a target. When captured, Iarno confirmed that the Black Spider was Drow and was actively searching the cave.
