Sergei Von Zarovich was the younger brother of Strahd, a noble and devout paladin of Lathander whose relationship with Tatyana became the catalyst for Barovia's eternal curse.

## The Truth

The traditional account held that Strahd murdered Sergei out of jealousy over Tatyana's affections. The reality, revealed through the combined journals of Strahd and Sergei, is far more tragic. Sergei and Tatyana were secretly in love — and she was pregnant with his child. Sergei's penultimate journal entry agonises over how to tell Strahd, planning to beg his brother to claim the child as his own while Sergei exiled himself.

Then Rahadin came to Sergei and told him that Strahd had killed Tatyana in a rage upon discovering the affair. Sergei's final entry is raw anguish: *"I CANNOT BEAR THIS! I WILL AVENGE MYSELF UPON HIM!"* He charged at Strahd with the power of Lathander. Meanwhile, Rahadin told Strahd that Sergei had thrown Tatyana from the tower. Brother was turned against brother — both believing the other a murderer — and the resulting conflict corrupted Strahd into the vampire lord, creating the demiplane prison of Barovia.

## Legacy

In his pristine white marble tomb beneath Castle Ravenloft, the party found Sergei's perfectly preserved body in fine noble clothing. Ireena stumbled forward, recognising him across lifetimes. They recovered his journal, the Armour of the Ravenlord trimmed in iridescent raven feathers, and a platinum greatsword hilt with a ruby pommel — the match for the crystal blade that would become the Ashbringer.

Sergei's journal was the key to everything. Presented to Strahd in the chapel by Ireena during the final battle, it was the evidence that convinced the vampire lord of Rahadin's millennia of betrayal and turned him against the corrupted dragon.
