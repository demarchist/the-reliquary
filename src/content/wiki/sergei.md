Sergei Von Zarovich was the younger brother of Strahd, a noble and well-regarded figure whose relationship with Tatyana became the catalyst for Barovia's eternal curse. According to the traditional account, Strahd murdered Sergei out of jealousy over Tatyana's affections, but the journals discovered by the party tell a more complex story. Sergei's own journal entries, read alongside Strahd's, suggest that Rahadin manipulated events to create the rift between the brothers.

The party considered various plans involving Sergei's memory, including using a wish spell to resurrect him and disguising themselves as him to reason with Strahd. Ultimately, his journal proved to be the key to unlocking the truth about Rahadin's treachery, and artifacts connected to Sergei, including his sword, were used by Fey in deep dives to restore Ireena's past-life memories.
