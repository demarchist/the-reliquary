Bolg is a Mountain Giant who was hired by Cirrus Al Kayan to serve as a mercenary for the Barony of Selunia. The party first encountered Bolg guarding a Duergar mining operation and, through extensive persuasion, mayonnaise, and a contest of strength, Cirrus convinced the giant to switch allegiances for twenty thousand gold. Bolg was further enticed by the mention of a Fire Giant presence in the Barony, as fire giants rank higher in the Ordening, the divine caste system of giantkind.

Bolg arrived at the Barony with a Hellhound and a strange eyeball-tailed feline as companions, immediately impressing and unnerving the residents. He was assigned to patrol the southern border near the Evermoors, a task he accepted readily. When a disturbance erupted in the Evermoors, Bolg was sent with scouts to investigate, only to be found dead, though his Ring of Regeneration was slowly healing his massive body. The party worked to move him to safety and revive their giant mercenary.
