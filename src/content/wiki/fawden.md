Fawden is the goddess of Chaos in the world of Al Askar, one of the last remaining deities being slowly devoured by Vecna (operating through Zalaam). Her consumption has been the cause of the increasing wild magic and highstorms plaguing the world. As Vecna consumed more of her essence, the moon dipped lower and magical instability worsened across the land.

The party undertook a desperate plan to deny Vecna the full measure of Fawden's power. In her final communication with Cirrus, Fawden acknowledged that she was dying but refused to let Vecna win. She proposed one last great act of chaos: surrendering her power during a ritual at the Font, allowing the majority of her divine energy to flow to Selûné through a portal, with only fragments going to Vecna and other gods. A small piece of Fawden would survive as an aspect of the new Moon goddess. The party executed this plan, and Fawden was destroyed in a flash of light, her sacrifice ensuring Vecna could not claim her full power.
