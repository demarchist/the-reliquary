The Bedine are a proud nomadic people who wander the vast desert of Anauroch. Living in tribal groups, they have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Great Desert, surviving where others would perish. The Bedine have a rich oral tradition and a deep spiritual connection to the land, and they guard their territory fiercely against outsiders. Their knowledge of the desert's hidden oases, ancient ruins, and dangerous creatures makes them invaluable guides for those who can earn their trust.

The Bedine's territory overlaps with the remnants of ancient Netheril, and they have coexisted with the buried ruins and lingering magic of that fallen empire for centuries. With Castle Ravenloft now transplanted to the Anauroch under Anaxtrasa's control, the Bedine have new neighbors to contend with in their ancestral homeland.
