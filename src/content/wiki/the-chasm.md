The Chasm is a massive crevasse that splits the ruined section of Neverwinter, sealed by magical wards at the surface. It descends deep underground through spider nests and undead-filled tunnels to an ancient celestial vault.

The vault contains one of five celestial artifact shards — fragments of an ancient radiant weapon used to defeat Orcus in ages past. Bregan D'aerthe maintained a base of operations within the vault, and the party is commissioned by Lord Neverember to investigate its depths. The expedition leads to the climactic confrontation with Kangaxx.
