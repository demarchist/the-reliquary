Barthen's Provisions is the general store in Phandalin, owned and operated by Elmar Barthen. The party's very first job was to escort a wagon of supplies from Neverwinter to this shop on behalf of the Rockseeker brothers. When they arrived and reported Gundren's kidnapping, Barthen offered a reward and loaned them resources to aid in the rescue.
