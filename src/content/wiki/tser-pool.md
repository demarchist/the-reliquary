## Description

Tser Pool is a body of water at the base of a waterfall in Barovia. It is the site where the archmage Mordenkainen supposedly fell after his battle with Strahd above the falls. Trolls inhabit the area around the pool.

## Significance

The party discovers the Wand of Lightning Bolts at Tser Pool and encounters Madame Eva's Vistani camp nearby. The pool's connection to Mordenkainen's failed assault on Castle Ravenloft foreshadows the dangers the party will face.
