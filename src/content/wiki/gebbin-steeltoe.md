Gebbin Steeltoe is a Dwarven patrol captain commanding a twelve-dwarf bridge patrol along the river Rauvin near Sundabar. He was first encountered in desperate straits — his patrol holding a squat stone bridge against a horde of goblinoids, dozens of orcs, goblins, ogres and two hill giants.

The group's arrival turned the battle decisively. Fëanon's fireballs incinerated one flank, Cyrrus raised a Wall of Force between the dwarves and their attackers, and the rest of the party dismantled the horde with overwhelming firepower. Two of Gebbin's dwarves died in the opening moments but were revived by Buumi and Cyrrus. The patrol captain was in shock at the saviours who had appeared at his time of need.

Gregarious and proud of his kinsmen's work, Gebbin assumed Gundren was the party's leader — one dwarf recognising another — and immediately fell into easy conversation with him. He escorted the group into Sundabar's Undercity with full military honours, ordering the dead hill giant butchered for a feast at the Hopping Hair tavern and assuring Fëanon that his lads would guard the wagon with their lives. His cousin Nora served as a cleric at the Undercity entrance, scanning for evil artefacts.
