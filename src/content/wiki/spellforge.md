## Description

The Spellforge is an ancient magical artifact located within Wave Echo Cave, manifesting as a glowing vortex of arcane energy. When activated, it can forge and shape magical spells in ways lost to modern wizardry.

## Properties

The Spellforge activates the Jade Frog golem that guards it, which grows into a larger construct when threatened. Within the Jade Frog lies an artifact shard — one of the fragments of a greater celestial artifact split across the multiverse.

## History

The Spellforge was the reason the Rockseeker brothers originally sought Wave Echo Cave. Its discovery leads the party to their first artifact shard and sets them on the path that defines the rest of the campaign.
