## Description

The Labyrinth is an enormous maze-like structure located within the Bog beneath the Tavern of Doors. Its walls and corridors constantly shift and rearrange themselves, making navigation extraordinarily difficult.

## Significance

The party must traverse the Labyrinth during their adventures in the Bog, facing its ever-changing passages and the creatures that dwell within. The structure's magical nature suggests ancient origins beyond simple goblin construction.
