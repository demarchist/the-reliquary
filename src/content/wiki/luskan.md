Luskan, the City of Sails, is a rough and lawless port city on the northern Sword Coast. Once a proud trading hub, Luskan fell under the control of pirates, criminals, and the Arcane Brotherhood, a cabal of powerful wizards who manipulate the city's affairs from the Hosttower of the Arcane. The city's five High Captains nominally rule, but true power lies with whoever commands the most ships, gold, and magical might.

Luskan's reputation as a den of piracy and intrigue makes it both a dangerous destination and a useful source of information and black market goods. Its position north of Waterdeep and south of Icewind Dale places it at a crossroads of northern maritime trade and the darker dealings of the Sword Coast's criminal underworld.
