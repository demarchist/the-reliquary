The Leanansidhe is an Archfey who operates through an economy of debts and obligations. Her true form is that of a striking red-headed Eladrin, though she is a consummate shapeshifter — appearing during the Reaver cleansing ritual in Sundabar disguised as Nora, a female Dwarven cleric and Gundren's cousin.

Her intervention during the ritual was subtle and uninvited. When Patches fought the Drider manifestation of her greatest fear — a nightmarish byproduct of the cleansing — the disguised Leanansidhe rushed in to help, healing the rogue of the creature's poison and assisting Fëanon and Gundren with the swarming spiders. Nobody questioned the timely arrival of a helpful cleric until the battle was won.

Only then did the Archfey reveal herself, winking with cat-like green eyes before dropping the disguise entirely. She announced that her debt with Patches was repaid — implying a prior arrangement the rogue had made to secure the conditions for the ritual. In the same breath, she declared that Gundren and Fëanon now owed her for the assistance she had rendered during the fight. She paralysed Tark with a touch when he rushed to attack and vanished in a flurry of snow and wind before anyone could argue.

The Leanansidhe's true motives and the nature of the debts she claims remain unclear. The group was left wondering what the Archfey might eventually demand in payment.
