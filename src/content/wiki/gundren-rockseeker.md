Gundren Rockseeker is a male Mountain Dwarf Gunslinger and a member of the Faerûn Defense Force. He is renowned both as a fearsome marksman and as perhaps the greatest Artificer in all of Faerûn.

## Appearance

Gundren stands just under four feet tall with a hardy, compact frame. His thick, gray-brown skin is rough and bristly, and he sports an enormous braided beard that hangs down below his waist, adding to his rugged and imposing appearance.

## Personality

Gundren has a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor and a rough-and-tumble attitude toward life. He is not afraid to use force and violence to solve problems, and believes in working hard to earn what he has. He is practical and straightforward, focused on achieving his own goals. He is not known for his generosity.

## Combat

In battle, Gundren fights with an enormous magical cannon, lobbing exploding shells and grapeshot at enemies. He is always accompanied by Guinevere, his astoundingly sophisticated clockwork lion — his magnum opus as an Artificer and the envy of Artificers the world over.

## The Rockseeker Manufactory

Gundren built and operates the Rockseeker Manufactory within the walls of the Keep of Thunder Bluff. It is a massive, sprawling complex of forges, foundries, and workshops where his extended family — renowned for their expertise in metalworking — produce some of the finest weapons and armor in Faerûn. The Manufactory is a major employer in the region.
