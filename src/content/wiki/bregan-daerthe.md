Bregan D'aerthe is a Drow mercenary and intelligence organization with operations across Faerûn. Their local operations are led by Lo'Dan, who maintains a complex and pragmatic relationship with the party.

The organization maintained a base of operations in the celestial vault beneath Neverwinter's Chasm and hires the party for multiple missions. Their agent Raylen operates undercover as a Moon Elf merchant, and the psionicist Kimmuriel provides teleportation capabilities. Bregan D'aerthe's interests often align with — but do not always match — those of the party.
