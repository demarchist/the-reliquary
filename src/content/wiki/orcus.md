Orcus is a Demon Lord known as the Prince of Undeath and the primary cosmic antagonist of the campaign. He seeks to collect five celestial artifact shards — fragments of an ancient radiant artifact that was used to defeat him in ages past.

His influence manifests through the necromantic mists that plague the world, raising the dead and destabilizing entire regions. His servants — including Kangaxx, Zenghi the Lich, and various cultists — execute his plans across Faerûn. Ancient vault murals depict him wielding a radiant artifact and skull staff before being defeated by celestials, hinting at the cyclical nature of his threat.

The Balgura Prophecy foretells his return: *"The Planet Born Dead waxes... The Goat Prince commands and his children are reborn; one of Gold, one of Adamantite and one of Obsidian."*
