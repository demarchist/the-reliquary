The Spellforged Adventuring Company is the official adventuring company founded by the party under Lord Dagult Neverember's writ of patronage. The charter allows them to accept questing contracts from bounty boards throughout the region.

The company is named after the Spellforge encountered in Wave Echo Cave — a fitting tribute to the adventure that first brought the party together as a cohesive group.
