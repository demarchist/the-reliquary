Urwen is a wereraven and member of the Keepers of the Feather — a secret organisation of shapechangers who oppose Strahd Von Zarovich from the shadows. He operates as the Martikov family's representative in Vallaki, running the Blue Water Inn and serving as a critical ally to the party throughout their time in Barovia.

## The Keepers of the Feather

Urwen revealed his true nature as a wereraven to the group, transforming between raven and human form mid-flight to loose arrows during the escape from Castle Ravenloft. His family — wife Danica, brothers Kurt and Derik, and nieces Herti and Gibra — formed a fighting force that accompanied the group on the final assault. They served as scouts, archers, and aerial support throughout the campaign's climax.

## The Final Battle

Urwen fought in the grand hall of Castle Ravenloft against Rahadin. He dispelled the dragon's globe of darkness with a cutting gesture, took poisoned daggers in the gut, healed himself with a prayer to Lathander, and continued fighting despite grievous wounds. After dispelling the darkness and retreating to cover, Rahadin plunged his blade into the injured Waldo and followed with a spinning dagger into the back of Urwen's head. The wereraven fell dead.

His death devastated Danica, who fought on with grief-fuelled fury — sinking daggers into Rahadin's back in a screaming assault. After the battle, Danica donned the Armour of the Ravenlord that Cyrrus returned to her, scooped up Urwen's body, and flew away as a giant raven with her children on her back.
