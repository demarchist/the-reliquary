description: "An ally in Vallaki who received bodies and messages for the party."

Urwen is a trusted contact in Vallaki during the party's time in Barovia. When the Spellforged needed to send the body of a fallen individual back to safety, they dispatched Mr. Pickles and Chekhov to deliver the corpse to Urwen in Vallaki. Urwen served as a reliable point of contact within the town, handling sensitive matters for the party while they ventured into the more dangerous reaches of Barovia.

Urwen's role as an intermediary in Vallaki placed them at the intersection of the town's complex political landscape, where the Burgomaster Vargas Vallakovich maintained his grip on power through forced festivals and Lady Wachter schemed to overthrow him.
