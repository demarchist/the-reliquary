Nezzan, known as the Black Spider, is a Drow agent who infiltrated Wave Echo Cave in search of the legendary Spellforge. He stole the wardstone from the Rockseeker brothers to gain access to the cave and orchestrated the kidnapping of Gundren.

His machinations included hiring the Cragmaw goblins and supporting the Redbrand Ruffians through their leader Iarno/Glasstaff. Nezzan's schemes come to an end when he is killed by Gundren with a thundercannon blast in Wave Echo Cave.
