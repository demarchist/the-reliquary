## Description

The Crystal Tuning Fork is a planar travel device recovered from the Sanctum of Krasus within Shatterpeak mountain. Crafted from crystal, it enables travel between different planes of existence.

## Properties

When properly attuned and activated, the Crystal Tuning Fork can open pathways between planes, serving as a key component for the spell Plane Shift. Its Netherese origin suggests capabilities beyond standard planar forks.
