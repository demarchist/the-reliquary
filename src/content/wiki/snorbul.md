Snorbul is a male Svirfneblin (deep gnome) Barbarian and a member of the Faerûn Defense Force. He is the owner, operator, and champion-in-residence of Snorbul's Hole, an underground fighting arena within the Barony of Thunder Bluff.

## Appearance

Snorbul is four feet tall with a peculiarly muscular, toned, and well-defined physique. His skin has a stone-like texture and appearance with a dark blue tone. He is bald and beardless with no body hair, and his eyes are red with long, pointed ears. Snorbul tends to wear as little clothing as possible — when he does, he prefers tight-fitting net shirts and leather short shorts that showcase his muscles.

## Personality

As a Barbarian, Snorbul has a tempestuous temperament with a barely-restrained primal rage always lurking below the surface. This rage fuels his unrelenting battle frenzy and grants him uncanny reflexes, resilience, and almost supernatural strength. He views the trappings of civilization as a sign of weakness, embracing extreme animalism instead.

As a Svirfneblin, Snorbul is most comfortable underground and in the dark, where his acute senses and innate abilities make him an apex predator. He is fiercely loyal to those he considers friends but quick to exact revenge against those who have wronged him. Despite his rugged exterior and volatile reputation, Snorbul harbors a deep compassion for individuals in vulnerable situations, particularly children and animals.

## Snorbul's Hole

Snorbul's Hole is a labyrinthine complex of underground tunnels and chambers. At surface level, it is an unassuming hole in the ground surrounded by piles of dirt and stones. Underground, however, it is a bustling hive of activity centered around spectated martial competitions — some with strict rules, others no-holds-barred cage matches to the death. The denizens are a famously rowdy crowd, and gambling is encouraged.
