description: "Tark's beloved old master — a monk enslaved by Zhengyi's forces and later rescued by Kenshi of Kara-Tur."
---

Gaddock is Tark's former master and the person who shaped the halfling monk into the fighter he became. Through a dream spell in the Nether Mountains, Tark found his master for the first time since their separation — a lone figure huddled in darkness, all skin and bone with wispy white hair and milky blind eyes. Gaddock thought it was a trick until Tark performed a stunning strike exactly as he had been taught. Recognising the truth, the old man broke down and told Tark of his enslavement at the hands of Zhengyi's followers.

The news sent Tark spiralling. He walked out of camp without a word, shadowstepped to the forest and spent the night attacking trees and smashing branches to work through his anguish. From that moment, freeing Gaddock became one of Tark's driving motivations.

A Sending spell eventually brought the news the monk had been desperate to hear: Gaddock had been rescued. A powerful monk from Kara-Tur named Kenshi, along with his disciples, had stormed the prison complex and freed Gaddock and all the other prisoners. In a dream meeting at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, Tark found his master with more colour in his cheeks — still bedridden but alive and safe.

Gaddock proved as wise as he had ever been. When Tark wanted to rush to Damara immediately, the old master refused to allow it, arguing that Tark's skills were needed with his friends. Zhengyi, backed by Orcus, was too powerful to face without allies. He promised to stay in touch through dream spells and to teach Tark new techniques as Kenshi revealed them.
