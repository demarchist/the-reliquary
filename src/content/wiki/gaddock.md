## Background

Gaddock is Tark's former master and mentor, a skilled practitioner who trained Tark in the ways of combat and discipline. He was captured by the forces of Zhengyi the Lich and later rescued by the monk Kenshi.

## Role in the Campaign

Gaddock's rescue initially brings relief, but his later appearances suggest he may have been corrupted during his captivity, potentially now serving Zhengyi as a Lich himself. This tragic transformation represents one of the most personal threats the party faces.

## Notable Traits

- Tark's beloved former master and mentor
- Rescued from Zhengyi's forces by Kenshi
- Possibly corrupted and turned into an undead servant of the Witch King
