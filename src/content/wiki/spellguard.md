## Overview

The Spellguard is Silverymoon's specialized magical enforcement agency. They protect the city's arcane infrastructure, investigate magical crimes, and maintain defensive wards and enchantments.

## Operations

The Spellguard regulates spellcasting within city limits, monitors dangerous artifacts, and investigates crimes with magical elements. Officers like Captain Mikael (who proved to be a traitor) and Officer Li serve in its ranks.

## Significance

During the Amnian invasion, the Spellguard's divided loyalties — with some members like Captain Mikael secretly collaborating with the enemy — create a crisis of trust within Silverymoon's magical defenses.
