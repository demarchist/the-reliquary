Rahadin is a dusk elf who serves as Strahd Von Zarovich's chamberlain and most trusted servant — or so it appeared for over a millennium. A figure of cold efficiency and quiet menace, he is surrounded by an aura of the screaming souls of those he has slain, a chilling reminder of his long history of violence. In truth, Rahadin is an adult silver dragon who has been manipulating events in Barovia since before the curse began.

## The Architect of Barovia

Rahadin's treachery is the foundation upon which the entire curse rests. He murdered Tatyana — Strahd's wife — by throwing her from the highest tower of Ravenloft. He told Strahd that Sergei did it and told Sergei that Strahd did it, turning brother against brother. He then accompanied Strahd to the Amber Temple, where dark powers corrupted the grieving king into a vampire. Every reincarnation of Tatyana's soul across more than a thousand years, Rahadin found and killed — using monsters, accidents, blades in the dark — to ensure Strahd would never find peace and the demiplane would never be broken.

His conspiracy extended to Baba Lysaga, whom the group identified as his co-conspirator through a prophetic dream and a crystal communication orb in his office. He referred to the ancient witch as his "beloved." Together they worked to maintain Barovia's prison while plotting to use the Fragment of the Last Word to escape to the mortal world with Strahd's army of undead.

## The Dragon

Nothic visions in the Amber Temple first revealed Rahadin's true nature as a silver dragon. The group confirmed it beyond doubt when, surrounded and wounded in the grand hall of Castle Ravenloft, Rahadin roared that he would not be slain — and a vortex of shadow erupted from his form, revealing an adult silver dragon wreathed in dark energy and crackling orange lightning.

In dragon form, Rahadin was a terrifying combatant. His shadow aura absorbed damage, regenerated through an Atropal entity that lived inside him and drained life force from nearby creatures, and shielded him from the worst of the party's attacks. He fought the entire group, their allies, two young dragons he had commanded, vampire thralls turned against him by Strahd, and Strahd himself — and it took all of them to bring him down.

## Death

Strahd tore Rahadin's throat out after Ireena presented Sergei's journal. Danica's crossbow bolt through the eye finished him. From the dragon's ear poured a deluge of blood and the small Atropal that had been living inside him, wailing as it died. Patches stabbed it with the Reaver, feeding the cursed blade and destroying it utterly. The beautiful silver dragon lay dead, surrounded by enemies and covered in the wounds of hundreds of strikes.

Tark sat beside the corpse in a beam of sunlight afterward, placed a hand on the dragon's head, and prayed that the majestic creature find peace in the afterlife.
