Rahadin is a dusk elf who serves as Strahd Von Zarovich's chamberlain and most trusted servant. A figure of cold efficiency and quiet menace, Rahadin has faithfully served the Lord of Barovia for centuries, carrying out his master's will with ruthless precision. He is surrounded by an aura of the screaming souls of those he has slain, a chilling reminder of his long history of violence.

The party discovered that Rahadin's treachery ran far deeper than mere servitude. Through the journals of Strahd and Sergei, they uncovered evidence that Rahadin murdered Tatyana repeatedly across her reincarnations, keeping Strahd and his beloved apart as part of a cruel manipulation. This revelation proved instrumental in turning Strahd against his chamberlain, as Ireena presented Sergei's journal entries that exposed Rahadin's centuries of deception.
