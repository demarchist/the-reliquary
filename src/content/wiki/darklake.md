The Darklake is an enormous subterranean body of water in the Underdark, connecting numerous settlements and cavern systems through its dark, still waters. It serves as a major transportation route for the denizens of the deep, with Duergar barges, kuo-toa rafts, and other vessels plying its lightless surface. The lake is home to dangerous aquatic creatures and the settlements along its shores include the kuo-toa village of Sloobludop.

The Spellforged traversed the Darklake aboard Hemeth's Duergar barge after freeing the merchant from kuo-toa captivity. The journey took them through dark, watery caverns and a series of locks leading to the Duergar city of Gracklstugh, though they were shocked to find the final lock gates had been ripped apart. The Darklake also served as the backdrop for the demonic incursions that plagued the region, with Demogorgon's influence corrupting the waters and their inhabitants.
