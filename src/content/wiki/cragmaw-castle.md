Cragmaw Castle is a goblinoid fortress run by a Bugbear chief, containing a large goblin garrison. Gundren Rockseeker was held captive here after being ambushed on the Triboar Trail.

The party assaults the castle to rescue Gundren, fighting through its defenders. The castle serves as the first major stronghold the party must overcome, and the intelligence gathered here leads them to Wave Echo Cave and the Black Spider's true plans.
