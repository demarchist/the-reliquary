Finn is the son of Aliyah Faen Tlabbar (Patches), kidnapped by the Drow and taken to Menzoberranzan where he is trained in wizardry and sorcery. His rescue becomes one of the driving motivations behind the party's dangerous journey into the Underdark.

The quest to free Finn takes the party through the Underdark's most perilous locations — from Velkynvelve to Gracksuluth to Menzoberranzan itself — and involves negotiations with Jarlaxle and Bregan D'aerthe. Finn later resides in Dokkar among the good-aligned Drow of Svartalfheim.
