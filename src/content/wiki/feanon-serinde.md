Fëanon Sërindë is a wizard of considerable age and learning, who has dedicated his later centuries to the preservation of knowledge. From his sanctuary on Sërindë Isle, he and his acolytes compile accounts of significant events across the realms.

The Reliquary — his greatest work — is an ever-growing archive of histories, maps, and lore gathered from adventurers, merchants, and travelers who pass through the isle.
