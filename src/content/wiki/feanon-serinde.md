Fëanon Sërindë is a High Elf Wizard and one of the founding members of the Spellforged Adventuring Company. He resides within an enormous tower built into the rocky prominence of Sërindë Isle, in the middle of Lake Seluna within the Barony of Thunder Bluff. He is a scholar of formidable intellect, a collector of dangerous knowledge, and — increasingly — a wizard willing to compromise his principles when the stakes demand it.

## Appearance

Fëanon has fine, symmetrical facial features and stands five feet eleven inches tall with a slender, elegant build. His long, flowing hair is almost bluish-white in color, framing his face beautifully. His wide-set green eyes are striking and captivating, and his copper-colored skin gives him a warm, exotic appearance. He has no facial hair, and his overall bearing is one of refinement and sophistication — a truly commanding figure wherever he goes.

## Philosophy

As a wizard, Fëanon has a deep understanding of the arcane arts and a strong belief in his own abilities. He views reliance on divine intervention as a form of intellectual dependency — a crutch that prevents people from achieving their full potential. Instead, he advocates for a rational, secular approach to problem-solving, relying on one's own knowledge and skills.

This belief in the power of the individual is central to his philosophy. He teaches his students and acolytes to rely on their own abilities rather than seeking guidance from the divine. His followers see him as forward-thinking and rational, though his beliefs are considered controversial or even heretical by those who hold more traditional views.

## The Jade Frog

Fëanon's most unusual companion is a jade frog golem — originally a small statue carried in the group's packs. When the group passed through the [[Spellforge]] beneath Wave Echo Cave, the statue sprang to life, becoming an animated construct of living stone with the Spellforge's power absorbed into its form. The frog has since developed a personality of its own: snatching an earring from a passerby's ear at the tournament, and — in one harrowing moment — swallowing the celestial artifact shard in the vault beneath Neverwinter, swelling and splitting with glowing cracks before regurgitating it just in time.

## Tactical Brilliance

Fëanon's combat contributions are defined by precision and control rather than raw power. He put four brawlers to sleep with a single spell during a festival scuffle. He stopped the Doppelganger Tarla's escape with a perfectly timed hold spell. He conjured lightning bolts against the Hydra beneath the Neverwinter docks and fireballs against the spider matriarch in the Chasm. During the cult attack at the Refounding Festival, he was the first to detect the incoming fireball — catching sight of the caster mid-incantation and warning the group.

His enchantment work extends beyond combat. He crafted [[Tarkathee Daru|Tark]]'s enchanted blindfold alongside Penelope Harpell — transforming the monk's devastating injury into a tactical advantage. He theorized that the [[Tavern of Doors]] was not a pocket plane at all but a portal to somewhere else entirely. And he determined that the group's companions were trapped in the Shadowfell during their sleep — a discovery that required both magical expertise and the intuition to investigate in the first place.

## The Amber Temple

Fëanon's most significant test of character came in the Amber Temple of Barovia, where dark powers offered gifts in exchange for fragments of the soul. Fëanon made a calculated choice: he accepted a dark entity's offering, took its fragment of power into himself, and then expelled it into his Ring of Spell Shielding — trapping the entity where it could be called upon for scrying without corrupting his soul. The maneuver demonstrated both his magical control and his willingness to dance at the edge of corruption for the sake of knowledge.

In the same temple, he discovered golden scrolls containing High Magic rituals of staggering power — Weave Mythal and Move Mountain — spells that required multiple archmages to cast. He also transcribed Wish and Power Word: Kill from the temple's library. The experience was humbling in a way that few things are for Fëanon: even with all his knowledge, he could not cast the most powerful spells alone.

## The Devil's Bargain

In the celestial vault beneath Neverwinter, the group faced a trial that split them between a demon warband and a devil patrol. Fëanon was escorted to a Malbranche devil and, acting as though he were a servant of Asmodeus, delivered a performance convincing enough to get one of the bearded devils executed on the spot. He secured the devils' key to the next trial — a feat of deception that would have impressed even [[Aliyah Faen Tlabbar|Patches]].

## Mentorship

As the campaign has progressed, Fëanon has evolved from a solitary scholar into something approaching a mentor. He agreed — with initial reluctance — to teach Patches' son wizardry. He took the apprentice Ruthir under his wing. In a conversation with Tark about the responsibility of teaching, he acknowledged the danger of powerful mages losing touch with reality — showing a self-awareness about his own potential for corruption that his younger self might not have possessed.

## The Tower

Fëanon's tower is eight hundred feet tall, predominantly round, and consists of fifty above-ground floors and a large relic chamber in the basement called the "Reliquary" — rows upon rows of arcane artifacts and ritual components. The tower houses a community of like-minded wizards, sorcerers, and other arcane practitioners who study under Fëanon's guidance.

The tower's defenses are an invisible masterwork of Antipathy and Sympathy enchantments, keyed to color-coded visitor badges. Unauthorized visitors find themselves gently but firmly guided away from restricted areas without ever realizing why.

Hidden on floors 45 through 47 lie Fëanon's most closely guarded secret: cloning and consciousness-transfer facilities dedicated to his ambitious project of achieving effective immortality.

## Rivalries and Relationships

Fëanon and [[Cirrus Al Kayan]] maintain a friendly rivalry rooted in their opposing philosophies — secular rationalism versus divine devotion. The heights of their respective towers are a constant source of competition, with Fëanon's tower being slightly taller — a point of pride for Fëanon and mild irritation for Cirrus.

His closest bond within the group is with Patches — they climbed a tree together on watch during the early days, trusted each other during infiltrations, and share a mutual understanding that needs few words. He is comfortable joking with Tark, coordinates closely with [[Gundren Rockseeker]] on magical projects, and maintains a productive working relationship with [[Doctor Breakfast|Doc]] and [[Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews|JmJm]].
