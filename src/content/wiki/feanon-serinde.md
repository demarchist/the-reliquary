Fëanon Sërindë is a High Elf Wizard and one of the founding members of the Faerûn Defense Force. He resides within an enormous tower built into the rocky prominence of Sërindë Isle, in the middle of Lake Seluna within the Barony of Thunder Bluff.

## Appearance

Fëanon has fine, symmetrical facial features and stands five feet eleven inches tall with a slender, elegant build. His long, flowing hair is almost bluish-white in color, framing his face beautifully. His wide-set green eyes are striking and captivating, and his copper-colored skin gives him a warm, exotic appearance. He has no facial hair, and his overall bearing is one of refinement and sophistication — a truly commanding figure wherever he goes.

## Philosophy

As a wizard, Fëanon has a deep understanding of the arcane arts and a strong belief in his own abilities. He views reliance on divine intervention as a form of intellectual dependency — a crutch that prevents people from achieving their full potential. Instead, he advocates for a rational, secular approach to problem-solving, relying on one's own knowledge and skills.

This belief in the power of the individual is central to his philosophy. He teaches his students and acolytes to rely on their own abilities rather than seeking guidance from the divine. His followers see him as forward-thinking and rational, though his beliefs are considered controversial or even heretical by those who hold more traditional views.

## The Tower

Fëanon's tower is eight hundred feet tall, predominantly round, and consists of fifty above-ground floors and a large relic chamber in the basement called the "Reliquary" — rows upon rows of arcane artifacts and ritual components. The tower houses a community of like-minded wizards, sorcerers, and other arcane practitioners who study under Fëanon's guidance.

The tower's defenses are an invisible masterwork of Antipathy and Sympathy enchantments, keyed to color-coded visitor badges. Unauthorized visitors find themselves gently but firmly guided away from restricted areas without ever realizing why.

Hidden on floors 45 through 47 lie Fëanon's most closely guarded secret: cloning and consciousness-transfer facilities dedicated to his ambitious project of achieving effective immortality.

## Rivalries and Relationships

Fëanon and Cirrus Al Kayan maintain a friendly rivalry rooted in their opposing philosophies — secular rationalism versus divine devotion. The heights of their respective towers are a constant source of competition, with Fëanon's tower being slightly taller — a point of pride for Fëanon and mild irritation for Cirrus.

Despite their philosophical differences, both respect and value each other as fellow members of the Faerûn Defense Force.
