## Description

Blingdenstone is a Deep Gnome (Svirfneblin) city located in the Underdark. Led by Chief Dorbo and his wife Senni, the settlement serves as one of the few bastions of order and civilization in the dangerous subterranean world.

## Significance

Blingdenstone provides the party with a safe haven during their Underdark travels. It is home to Snorbul's uncle Gruttag and his clan, giving the gnome party member a personal connection to the city. Traders from Blingdenstone maintain commerce routes throughout the Underdark.
