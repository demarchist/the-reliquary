The Fane of Selune is a massive tower of twisting white marble on the mainland shore of Lake Seluna, built by Cirrus Al Kayan as both his residence and the headquarters of the Cult of Selune. It is an architectural marvel that encapsulates Cirrus' love for himself and his devotion to the moon goddess.

## Exterior

Outside the Fane are sprawling English-style gardens and well-manicured hedges forming labyrinthine passages. White and silver motifs dominate the grounds, with symbols of Selune — most notably the crescent moon — omnipresent. Through powerful divine magic, the Fane is shrouded in the perpetual umbra of a total solar eclipse, making the tower and its grounds surreal, otherworldly, and subtly unsettling. How the gardens thrive without direct sunlight is unexplained.

## Interior

The interior is dominated by a massive statue carved in the likeness of Cirrus himself. The statue extends up the core of the tower, housing a hidden elevator system. A platform extending from the statue's "mouth" overlooks the pews and serves as Cirrus' pulpit for delivering sermons. Beyond the statue, the interior is austere, with silvery moon motifs as the dominant aesthetic.

## The Peak

At the top of the Fane is a flat platform open to the sky, where Cirrus can often be heard chanting prayers to Selune during the night. His chanting — which audibly resembles yodeling — is objectively bad, often dissonant or off-key, and usually far too loud.

## Den of Dreams

The basement houses a magical sanctum called the Den of Dreams, open to the public for a fee.

## Administration

Day-to-day operations are overseen by Topsy and Turvy, two were-rat siblings who were among Cirrus' initial converts.
