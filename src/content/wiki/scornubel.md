Scornubel, known as the Caravan City, is a bustling trading hub situated on the River Chionthar in the Western Heartlands of Faerûn. The city serves as a major nexus for overland trade routes, where caravans from across the continent converge to buy, sell, and resupply. Its population is transient and diverse, with merchants, teamsters, and adventurers from every corner of the Realms passing through its gates.

Scornubel's reputation as a place where anything can be bought or sold, few questions asked, makes it a vital part of the commercial infrastructure of western Faerûn. The city's loose governance and mercantile focus create an atmosphere of freewheeling commerce that attracts both legitimate traders and those operating in the shadows.
