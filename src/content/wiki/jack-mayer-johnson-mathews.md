Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews, commonly known as JmJm or simply Jack, is a Half-Elf Bard with a flair for the dramatic and a shadowed past. He is a member of the Spellforged Adventuring Company, owner of the JMJM Theater, and — as has recently come to light — a native of the planar city of Sigil.

## Appearance

Standing at five feet ten inches, Jack possesses thin, angular features accentuated by sharp cheekbones and a perpetually expressive face. His style is as bold as his personality — short, spiky hair dyed in a spectrum of vibrant colors, colorful suits, dramatic costumes, flamboyant hats, flowing scarves, and elaborate turbans. His room in the [[Tavern of Doors]] reflects the same excess: opulent and ridiculous to the extreme, with a four-poster curtained bed and a back door that opens onto a magical portal.

## The Performer

On stage, Jack is a master of his craft — a charismatic performer whose dynamic, energetic presence captivates audiences across Faerûn. His greatest triumph came at the Neverwinter Refounding Festival, where the entire group worked in perfect harmony to stage a performance the likes of which few had ever seen. Stage lights dimmed as a gout of flame announced his arrival. He winked into view center stage, mounted a spectral steed engulfed in faerie fire as petals rained upon the crowd, and performed against a backdrop of standing stones, fireworks, smoking bottles, and erupting lightning bolts. He charmed his rival [[Lorde]] into joining him on the spectral mount, and the two galloped off together — the audience in raptures — only for Lorde to break free of the enchantment mid-kiss and tumble from the horse. JmJm refused her challenge to a bard-off, shouting that he'd see her in Baldur's Gate.

## The Dark Whistler

Before joining the Spellforged, Jack was infamous as The Dark Whistler — a ruthless assassin whose reputation was built on cold efficiency, brutal tactics, and the chilling whistle that accompanied each kill. This persona was a manifestation of Jack's trauma-induced dissociative disorder, a coping mechanism that allowed him to mentally transform horrors into surreal stage performances. Blood became ribbons, death scenes were choreographed dances, and the terror of victims was drowned out by imagined applause.

A fateful encounter with a target's family shattered this illusion, forcing Jack to confront the consequences of his actions and sending him on a long journey of self-discovery and redemption. Despite his efforts, The Dark Whistler lingers as a shadowy presence in his mind — a constant reminder of the violence that once defined him.

## Charm and Manipulation

JmJm's bardic magic is most potent in the realm of enchantment. He charmed four goblins in the Cragmaw eating hall into turning on their fellows with savage enthusiasm, tearing a goblin limb from limb. He charmed a bearded devil into swinging at its own companion. During the martial tournament, he cast under-the-radar spells from the stands — afflicting knight Verith with a madness spell that caused him to throw his sword away and charge Tark bare-handed, handing Tark the victory. His charm magic operates at the boundary between performance and manipulation, and he wields it with cheerful ruthlessness.

## Gold and Greed

Gold is JmJm's truest motivator. He paused mid-dungeon to lick a gold ore vein in Wave Echo Cave. He immediately agreed to Lo'Dan's dangerous mission into the Chasm the instant a sack of gold was placed on the table. He attempted to steal a dead dwarf's beard at a grave — stopped only by a furious Buumi. He has shown "signs of insanity, compulsively biting down on a gold coin" after traumatic magical experiences. His greed is not malicious but deeply instinctive, as though gold exerts a gravitational pull on him that he cannot resist.

## The Rivalry with Lorde

JmJm's most persistent antagonist is [[Lorde]] — a small, attractive bard accompanied by Gronk, her hulking barbarian backup singer. Their rivalry is both professional and personal. Lorde verbally dismantled JmJm upon their first meeting at the Keep of Thunder Bluff and challenged him to the festival stage. JmJm answered with the legendary performance that charmed her mid-show. Later, the group discovered Lorde imprisoned in Goblin Town — she was a Harper agent sent to prevent the Goblin King from consuming JmJm's mind and using his body to access the prime material plane. Their rivalry sits atop a complicated web of grudging respect and unresolved tension.

## The Sigil Connection

JmJm is a native of Sigil, the City of Doors — a fact that emerged during the Goblin King crisis. The Goblin King had been attempting to consume JmJm's mind and take over his body to escape into the prime material plane. This planar origin may explain his strange relationship with reality: he has disappeared into mist during battles in Barovia, reappearing later with no explanation. His room in the Tavern of Doors contains a portal to unknown planes. The full implications of his Sigil heritage remain unclear, but they suggest depths to JmJm that even his companions do not fully understand.

## The Tavern of Doors

JmJm received the [[Tavern of Doors]] from Sharess, goddess of hedonism, after she appeared in his room one night. The magical door opens from anywhere into a pocket dimension that has grown steadily throughout the campaign — adding rooms, a forge, and even a stable of astral goblins. It serves as the group's mobile base, escape route, and home between adventures.

## The Shapeshifting Cloak

One of JmJm's prized possessions is a custom-crafted cloak: a mantle of crow feathers stitched to doppelganger skin and dyed with goblin blood, with a collar of green dragon scales fastened by a ruby-encrusted adamantite clasp. Beneath hangs a midnight blue silk cloak with mithril flecks and a cat fur hem. The garment grants disguise magic and a bonus to defense — as flamboyant in function as it is in form.

## The JMJM Theater

Jack owns, operates, and stars at the Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews Theater (The JMJMT), an elaborate venue featuring a technologically advanced stage designed by [[Gundren Rockseeker]].
