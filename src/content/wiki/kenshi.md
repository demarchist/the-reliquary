Kenshi is a powerful monk from the distant land of Kara-Tur. Little is known of his background beyond the fact that he commands a contingent of disciples and possesses the martial skill — and the audacity — to assault a prison complex run by the followers of a lich.

When Gaddock, Tark's master, had all but given up hope of rescue, Kenshi and his disciples stormed the facility, freed the prisoners and carried the emaciated old monk to safety. A Sending spell reached Tark with the news, and a subsequent dream meeting at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose confirmed Gaddock's rescue.

Gaddock spoke of Kenshi with deep respect and mentioned that the Kara-Turan monk would be teaching him new techniques — knowledge he intended to pass on to Tark through their dream meetings. The connection to Kara-Tur is notable given that one of Cyrrus's warlock visions showed an Elven samurai in the far east, suggesting the group's path may eventually lead to Kenshi's homeland.
