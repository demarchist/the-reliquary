Krezk is a small, walled village in the western reaches of Barovia, situated near the Abbey of Saint Markovia high on the mountainside above. The village is one of the few settlements in Barovia that maintains some semblance of normalcy, with its residents living behind sturdy walls and trying to eke out an existence under the ever-present shadow of Strahd Von Zarovich. The Burgomaster of Krezk is protective of his people and wary of strangers.

The Abbey above the village is home to the Abbot, a celestial being who has been driven mad by centuries of isolation in Barovia. The proximity to this powerful but unpredictable figure adds another layer of danger to life in Krezk, though the village itself remains one of the quieter corners of Strahd's domain.
