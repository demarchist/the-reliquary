---

Arkto is a figurine of power belonging to Gundren Rockseeker that, when activated, summons a great winged owlbear. Gundren first used the figurine during the party's escape from Velkynvelve in the Underdark, where Arkto carried him, Snorbul, and the Svirfneblin twins safely to the cavern floor below. Since then, the winged owlbear has become Gundren's primary aerial mount, providing him with a stable platform from which to fire his Thundercannon during battles.

Arkto has been instrumental in countless engagements, from air support during the defense of the Barony to dramatic rescues such as plucking Cirrus from danger in mid-dive. The owlbear has also served as general transportation for the party, carrying children to safety, ferrying groups through Ringed Veils, and enabling Gundren's signature fighting style of raining fire from above.
