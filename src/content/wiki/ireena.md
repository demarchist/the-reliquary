Ireena is a striking young woman living in the village of Barovia who bears an uncanny resemblance to Tatyana — the long-dead bride of Strahd Von Zarovich. As Tatyana's latest reincarnation, she is the object of Strahd's centuries-long obsession, making her both a key figure in the Barovia chapter and a person in constant mortal danger.

## Character

Ireena carries herself with a quiet strength that belies her circumstances. She accepted the overwhelming truth of her identity — that she was Tatyana reborn, that she had been murdered dozens of times across more than a millennium — with a stoic composure that earned the group's respect. When Fëanon dove into her mind to unlock her past-life memories using Sergei's crystal sword, the trauma of dozens of deaths nearly destroyed her. Fëanon and Cyrrus worked frantically to stabilise her, and she emerged damaged, furious, but herself.

She is not a passive figure. At the dinner with Strahd, she fought alongside the group when the vampires lost control. She charged skeletons with daggers in the bone-decorated dining hall. During the final assault on Castle Ravenloft, she was smuggled into the castle in a bag of holding, emerged to fight Strahd's vampire brides with a spear and sabre, and personally presented Sergei's journal to Strahd in the chapel — pushing through waves of artifact energy that could have killed her to reach the husband she had loved in a former life.

## The Truth

The party discovered that Rahadin — not Strahd — was responsible for Tatyana's deaths. The chamberlain had murdered her in every reincarnation, using monsters, accidents, and blades in the dark to prevent her soul from ever reaching Strahd. The very first death was the simplest: Rahadin threw her from the highest tower of Ravenloft without a word. She died confused, murdered by a man she had considered a dear friend. He then told Strahd that Sergei had done it, and told Sergei that Strahd had done it — turning brother against brother and creating the curse.

## End

When Strahd was finally convinced of the truth and the castle was transported to the mortal world, Ireena took his hand one final time. Lathander offered every Barovian soul a choice: live on or find rest. Ireena crumbled to dust, accepting the call to move on. Behind her, Strahd walked into the sunrise.
