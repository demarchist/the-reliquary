Ireena is a striking young woman living in the village of Barovia who bears an uncanny resemblance to Tatyana — the long-dead bride of Strahd Von Zarovich. As Tatyana's latest reincarnation, Ireena is the object of Strahd's centuries-long obsession, making her both a key figure in the Barovia chapter and a person in constant mortal danger.
