## Description

The Old Bonegrinder is a windmill perched on a hill outside Vallaki in Barovia. It served as the lair of Morgantha and her daughters, a coven of night hags who produced cursed pastries made from the flesh of captured children.

## Significance

The party assaults the Old Bonegrinder to rescue Chekov and other captured children, ultimately destroying the hag coven and the windmill itself. The Destruction of the Old Bonegrinder marks a significant victory against Barovia's dark forces and the end of Morgantha's predatory operation.
