Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden, is the drow goddess of beauty, song, dance, swordwork, hunting, moonlight, and the redemption of the drow. She is the daughter of Corellon Larethian and Lolth, and chose exile alongside the drow out of love for her people, hoping to one day lead them back to the surface and the light. Her followers are rare among the drow but fiercely devoted, often living on the surface in small communities hidden within forests.

Eilistraee represents hope for a better future for the dark elves, standing in direct opposition to her mother Lolth's tyranny. Her faithful celebrate life through moonlit dances, song, and the hunt, seeking to prove that drow can live in harmony with the surface races.
