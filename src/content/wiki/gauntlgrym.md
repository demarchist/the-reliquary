Gauntlgrym is a legendary dwarven city of immense antiquity, once the crown jewel of dwarven civilization. Built deep beneath the surface, the city was powered by a primordial of fire bound within its Great Forge, which produced weapons and artifacts of unparalleled quality. The city was lost for millennia, its location becoming the stuff of myth and legend, until it was rediscovered in recent years.

Gauntlgrym's legacy is reflected in the dwarven craftsmanship and engineering that the party has encountered throughout their journey, from the Delzoun Instant Fortress to the Rockseeker Manufactory. The city represents the pinnacle of what dwarven civilization can achieve and serves as an inspiration for Gundren Rockseeker's own ambitious creations.
