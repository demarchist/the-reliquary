Li Xian is a powerful Oni lord and necromancer who serves the Corpsetaker. A blue-skinned shapeshifter of immense power, he is responsible for the murders of Buumi's parents — making him a deeply personal enemy of the party.

Li Xian's defeat by the party avenges Buumi's family, though the Corpsetaker escapes after its servant falls. His necromantic abilities and connections to the broader conspiracy make him one of the campaign's most dangerous individual antagonists.
