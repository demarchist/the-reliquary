The Saurians were an ancient and technologically advanced race that once dominated the world of Al Askar. They possessed capabilities far beyond what other civilizations could achieve, including the construction of the Ringed Veils (fargates) that enabled interplanar travel, the creation of Firelance weapons, and the mining of spell-infusable crystals. Murals depict them as humanoid-reptilian beings from a planet with two suns, and their ruins are scattered across Al Askar.

The Saurians were destroyed approximately a thousand years before the party's arrival, breaking their world in the process and unleashing the chaos that entangled magic and sorcery ever since. They had been fighting the Phaerimm, finding their enemy even in Faerûn, suggesting a conflict that spanned multiple worlds. The ancient Saurian engineer Hasrala, preserved as a soul in a phylactery crystal, provided the party with crucial information and combination keys to access Saurian technology.
