The Underdark is a vast, interconnected network of caverns, tunnels, and subterranean seas stretching beneath the surface of Faerûn. It is home to numerous civilizations and creatures, from the drow cities of Menzoberranzan to the deep gnome settlement of Blingdenstone, the Duergar stronghold of Gracklstugh, and countless dangers lurking in the lightless depths. The Underdark is divided into three layers: the Upperdark, the Middledark, and the Lowerdark, each more dangerous than the last.

The Spellforged spent a significant portion of their journey traversing the Underdark after being captured and imprisoned in Velkynvelve. They escaped alongside fellow prisoners including Shuushar, Ront, and Mr. Pickles, navigating through the Darklake, Sloobludop, Gracklstugh, and Blingdenstone while being pursued by Ilvara Mizzrym and contending with the demonic incursions that were tearing the subterranean realm apart.
