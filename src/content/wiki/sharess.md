Sharess is a goddess who appears to JmJm during the night and gifts him the Tavern of Doors — a magical extradimensional space contained within a small box. She departs exasperated by JmJm's characteristic insolence.

Her symbols are found on JmJm's magical harp, suggesting an ongoing — if perhaps one-sided — divine patronage of the bard.
