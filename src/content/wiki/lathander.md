Lathander, the Morninglord, is the god of dawn, spring, birth, renewal, creativity, and youth. His faith is one of the most widely practiced in Faerûn, with temples and shrines in nearly every settlement. Lathander's clergy are optimistic and active, encouraging new beginnings and the pursuit of creative endeavors. His symbol, a stylized sunrise, is a beacon of hope across the Realms.

The Morninglord's influence is felt in the Barony of Selunia, where local religious festivals honor him. One such celebration involves locals running to the top of the Red Hill and cliff-diving into Lake Selunia to demonstrate their courage and vigor before the Morning Lord.
