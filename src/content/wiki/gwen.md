Gwen is a mechanical lion belonging to Gundren Rockseeker, one of the party's most reliable companions and mounts. Crafted through artifice and enchantment, the lion serves as both a combat asset and a means of transportation, capable of carrying riders and hauling equipment across difficult terrain. Gwen has been with the party since their early adventures in the Bog and has proven invaluable in countless engagements.

Over the course of the campaign, Gwen has been lent to other party members when needed, including serving as a mount for Buumi and Patches during critical missions. The mechanical lion's durability and loyalty make it one of the Spellforged's most cherished possessions, and Gundren's bond with the construct is evident in how often he deploys Gwen alongside his other inventions in battle.
