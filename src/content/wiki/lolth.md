Lolth, the Spider Queen, is the chief deity of the drow and the demon queen of spiders. She dwells in the Demonweb Pits, a layer of the Abyss spun from her own dark webs. Lolth demands absolute loyalty and obedience from her followers, and drow society is structured around her matriarchal priesthood, where females hold positions of supreme power and males are subjugated. Her clergy are ruthless and cruel, enforcing her will through treachery, poison, and fear.

Lolth's influence is felt throughout the Underdark, particularly in Menzoberranzan, the great drow city. Her priestesses command the noble houses and wage constant political warfare against one another in her name. The party encountered the consequences of Lolth's dark worship during their time in the Underdark, where her followers pursued and hunted them relentlessly.
