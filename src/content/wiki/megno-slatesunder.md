Megno Slatesunder is a Dwarven Enchanter who maintains a workshop near the Everfire in Sundabar's Undercity. An old friend of Fëanon's, he was initially apprehensive when the wizard appeared wearing an Illithid mask — a reaction that melted into genuine joy once Fëanon removed it and Megno realised his friend was free of the Mind Flayers' enthralment.

Megno is a gifted craftsman whose workshop is cluttered with half-finished prototypes, many of them admirable but imperfect attempts to replicate Gundren's artificing work — a fact that amuses both dwarves and fuels a companionable rivalry. His true talents lie in enchantment and ancient languages, particularly Old Delzoun. When the group brought him a mysterious Dwarven adventurer's journal, he attacked the translation with enthusiasm, eventually uncovering information significant enough to leave even Fëanon speechless.

His most remarkable collaboration was the prosthetic arm for Buumi. Working alongside Fëanon and Gundren over the course of a month in his Sundabar workshop, the three created a metal cap and brace that generates a glowing hand of energy upon command — restoring to the paladin something of what Barovia had taken.

Megno fought bravely during the Battle for Silverymoon, leading the Sundabarian Dwarven delegation from the front with sheets of flame and defensive magic. His experience during the invasion strengthened his belief in the treaty between Silverymoon and the dwarves, and he volunteered to attend the Council of Helm's Hold personally. He has a human apprentice named Molly, a gangly teenage girl whose skills he vouches for despite appearances.
