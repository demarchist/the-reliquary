## Description

Sharza, known as the City of the Dead, is an ancient ruined city in Al Askar. At its heart stands the Black Pyramid of Barzak, which houses a fragment of the Last Word. The city is guarded by Ajak, Jareem's mate who was killed and transformed into a Hollow Dragon.

## Significance

Sharza is a critical destination for the party, as they must retrieve the Last Word Fragment from within the Black Pyramid. The presence of the Hollow Dragon Ajak and other undead guardians makes the city one of the most dangerous locations they encounter in Al Askar.
