The Ashbringer is a celestial crystal greatsword born from the sacrifice of the Planetar Anduriel at the Abbey of Krezk. Originally recovered as a powerless hilt and broken blade from Sergei Von Zarovich's tomb in the crypts of Castle Ravenloft, the weapon was reforged when the angel's divine grace flowed into the crystal and the beacon of Argynvostholt poured in after it.

## Properties

The sword blazes with holy sunlight that causes vampires and undead to flinch and burn at its approach. Its most devastating ability is a chain reaction effect: when an undead creature is slain by the Ashbringer, it detonates in a sunburst that can ignite the next undead, and the next — cascading through ranks of undead in seconds. At the Battle of Krezk, this effect destroyed hundreds of the Wild Hunt in a single chain. A voice speaks to its wielder: *"Leave nothing but ash in your wake."*

## Wielders

Tark wielded the Ashbringer during the Battle of Krezk, using the harsh shadows cast by the sword's own radiance to shadowstep across the battlefield. He later entrusted the blade to Buumi for safekeeping, preferring his beloved Staff of the Dragon King. During the final battle in Castle Ravenloft, Buumi wielded the Ashbringer to devastating effect against Rahadin and his undead servants, the crystal sword's sunbursts burning away the dragon's shadow aura and destroying skeletal warriors in cascading detonations.
