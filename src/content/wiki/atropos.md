Atropos is a vast malevolent entity approaching the material plane, whose fragmentary dark powers are imprisoned within amber sarcophagi in the Amber Temple of Barovia. The campaign itself — *The Rise of Atropos* — is named for the growing threat this entity poses to all existence.

Atropos represents the ultimate cosmic antagonist behind the campaign's events. While Orcus, Zenghi, Strahd, and other villains serve as more immediate threats, the shadow of Atropos looms over everything — a force of annihilation whose influence corrupts and empowers the lesser evils the party faces.
