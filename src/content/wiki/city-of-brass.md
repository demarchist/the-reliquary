The City of Brass is the legendary capital of the efreeti, situated on the Plane of Fire. It is a vast metropolis built of brass, bronze, and flame, where the powerful efreeti sultans hold court amidst opulence that defies mortal comprehension. The city floats above a sea of fire, its towers and minarets gleaming in the eternal conflagration, and its markets trade in goods from across the multiverse, including slaves, magical items, and elemental materials impossible to find elsewhere.

The City of Brass represents the pinnacle of efreeti civilization and serves as a nexus for planar trade and intrigue. The party's possession of an Efreeti Bottle hints at connections to this extraordinary place, where genies of immense power broker deals that can reshape the fates of worlds.
