## Description

Tresendar Manor is an old manor house in Phandalin that has been taken over by the Redbrand Ruffians as their base of operations. Beneath the manor lies a network of cellars and tunnels used by the gang.

## Significance

The party raids Tresendar Manor early in the campaign to dismantle the Redbrand Ruffians' operations in Phandalin, discovering that their leader Iarno (Glasstaff) has been working with darker forces. This is one of the party's first major dungeon-clearing operations.
