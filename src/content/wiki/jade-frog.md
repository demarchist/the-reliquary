## Description

The Jade Frog is a golem constructed from jade that guards the Spellforge in Wave Echo Cave. When the Spellforge activates, the Jade Frog springs to life and grows into a larger construct to defend the artifact.

## Properties

The golem contains an artifact shard within its body — a fragment of a celestial artifact that the party must retrieve. Its activation is tied directly to the Spellforge's magical energy.
