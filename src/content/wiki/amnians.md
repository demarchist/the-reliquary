The Amnians are the citizens and agents of the mercantile nation of Amn, known throughout Faerûn for their commercial acumen, political cunning, and willingness to use military force to protect their trade interests. Amnian merchants dominate trade routes across the continent, and their nation's wealth funds a sophisticated network of diplomats, spies, and soldiers. The Amnian approach to international relations is fundamentally transactional, viewing every interaction through the lens of profit and advantage.

The party has had extensive dealings with the Amnians, beginning with the hostile coup attempt in Silverymoon and continuing through the diplomatic delegation to Helm's Hold that included S'Olaa Al Kayan, Abdul Al Selemchant, Leigham Al Selemchant, Gneiss, and Chani. The assassin attack on the Bumidere estate during these negotiations revealed deep divisions within the Amnian ranks, with figures like Gneiss and Chani proving honorable while others, like the assassin Xor, served darker agendas.
