The Ringed Veils — also known as Fargates — are a network of interconnected portals connecting multiple worlds and planes of existence. Built by an ancient Saurian civilization, the gates consist of massive ring structures that open dimensional passages when activated.

The network includes hub locations called Crossroads where multiple gate platforms converge. The party discovers and uses the Ringed Veil network to travel between Faerûn, Al Askar, and other worlds. Cultists and automated defenses guard many of the gates, and the network itself becomes a key strategic asset in the party's quest to locate the scattered fragments of the Last Word.
