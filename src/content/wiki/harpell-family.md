The Harpell Family is a clan of eccentric wizards residing at Ivy Mansion in the wizard town of Longsaddle. Notable members include the ancient Harkell Harpell (who accidentally summons a Balgura demon), Quetzee Harpell, and Penelope Harpell.

The Harpells provide crucial support to the party throughout the campaign — crafting the wardstone needed to enter Wave Echo Cave, enchanting Tark's blindfold, gifting the Megascope communication device, and providing teleportation and research services. Their eccentricity is matched only by their considerable magical power.
