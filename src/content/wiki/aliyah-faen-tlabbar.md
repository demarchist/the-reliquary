Aliyah Faen Tlabbar is a Drow woman and Rogue who escaped the ruthless underdark societies of the dark elves to make her way on the surface world. She is a member of the Faerûn Defense Force and the owner and proprietor of The Establishment.

## Appearance

Aliyah is a small, slender woman with deep purple skin, silvery-white hair, sharp angular features, and piercing almond-shaped eyes that glint like cut gems in shadowy environments. Her movements are stealthy and efficient — she seems to melt from shadow to shadow when she wishes to avoid attention, yet moves with lightning quickness when threatened. Her skin bears the scars of many hard-fought battles. She prefers dark, severely minimal clothing for ease of movement, though her weapons and equipment are clearly of fine make.

## Personality

Raised in the brutal underdark, Aliyah learned harsh lessons about trust, deceit, and survival. This instilled a near-pathological sense of caution and suspicion — she is constantly watching the shadows for hidden threats. She nurtures the trauma of her early life as a motivational tool, believing that letting go of past suffering would blunt her reflexes. She keeps herself isolated and aloof, even from companions she has begun to trust, though she has formed a close bond with Fëanon and relies on Snorbul more than she would readily admit.

## The Establishment

Aliyah operates The Establishment — a bustling underworld complex of inn, brothel, and casino at a crossroads within the Barony. It serves as both a business venture and a way to cement her network of connections among the shady underbelly of the region. She maintains a strict code of conduct and does not tolerate violence within its walls.

## Relationships

Aliyah has an on-again, off-again romantic relationship with Horatio Von Bumidere. Drawn to each other despite vastly different temperaments and alignments, they have danced around mutual attraction for years. Her fierce independent streak and chaotic tendencies conflict with Horatio's lawful principles, and something always seems to pull them apart before long — yet the spark refuses to fade.
