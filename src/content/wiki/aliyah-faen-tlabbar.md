Aliyah Faen Tlabbar is a Drow woman and Rogue who escaped the ruthless underdark societies of the dark elves to make her way on the surface world. She is a founding member of the Spellforged Adventuring Company, the owner and proprietor of [[The Establishment]], a champion of the mysterious Lady Faye, and — beneath her guarded exterior — one of the most tactically gifted and darkly funny members of the group. She is approximately eighty years old.

## Appearance

Aliyah is a small, slender woman with deep purple skin, silvery-white hair, sharp angular features, and piercing almond-shaped eyes that glint like cut gems in shadowy environments. Her movements are stealthy and efficient — she seems to melt from shadow to shadow when she wishes to avoid attention, yet moves with lightning quickness when threatened. Her skin bears the scars of many hard-fought battles. She prefers dark, severely minimal clothing for ease of movement, though her weapons and equipment are clearly of fine make. She wears tinted goggles crafted by [[Gundren Rockseeker]] to protect her light-sensitive eyes on the surface, and often wraps herself in a Drow Piwafwi — a cloak of elvenkind taken from the Doppelganger Tarla.

## Personality

Raised in the brutal underdark, Aliyah learned harsh lessons about trust, deceit, and survival. This instilled a near-pathological sense of caution and suspicion — she is constantly watching the shadows for hidden threats, stringing up tripwire perimeters around campsites, and positioning herself to flank before anyone else has assessed whether there's a threat at all. She nurtures the trauma of her early life as a motivational tool, believing that letting go of past suffering would blunt her reflexes.

Yet for all her severity, Patches has a dry, cutting humor and a talent for theatrical absurdity. She performs tea service during rests in the middle of dungeons — a gesture of domesticity so incongruous with her lethal profession that it has become the group's most reliable comfort. She convinced [[Horatio Von Bumidere|Buumi]] to keep his helmet on at all times after he annoyed her by correcting her about the difference between demons and devils. She got her tournament opponent Gasciogne spectacularly drunk the night before their bout, then hammered him in the arena while he could barely stand.

## Tactical Brilliance

Patches is the group's most surgically precise combatant. She operates from the shadows, striking at moments of maximum vulnerability with poisoned blades and retreating before retaliation. During the Cragmaw infiltration, she interrogated the Doppelganger Tarla and broke her for intelligence. She solo-looted the dragon's hoard while [[Venomfang]] raged overhead. She landed the paralysis-inducing sneak attack that shut down the cult mage at the Refounding Festival, and her poisoned blades ended [[Hendrell]]'s tournament bout before the Champion of the Moonwood could bring his full skill to bear.

Her crowning moment came atop the Demon Prince Demogorgon — she scaled the beast, flipped her blades over in her hands, and plunged them both home into its twin heads.

Her instinct for flanking and ambush extends beyond combat. When the group approached the Androsphinx in the vault's wheat field trial, Patches immediately broke off to flank through the tall grass — a habit so ingrained that she does it before even knowing whether there's a threat.

## The Reaver

Patches carries a cursed dagger known as [[The Reaver]] — a weapon that hungers for souls and must periodically feed. The sight of the drawn blade turns stomachs. When dark energy first flooded into her as the weapon attacked her soul, only [[Horatio Von Bumidere|Buumi]]'s healing magic kept her alive long enough to bring the dagger under mental control. She subdued it — and in horror realized the full extent of its evil power. When she tried to throw it away, it puffed into mist and reappeared at her side. It has been bound to her ever since.

When the Reaver's hunger gnaws, Patches has made dark sacrifices to keep it sated — once killing one of the [[Tavern of Doors]]' astral goblins in the night. When [[Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews|JmJm]] noticed the goblin missing the next morning and demanded a search, no trace was found. The Reaver's power is undeniable: it melted through [[Kangaxx]]'s golden ribcage when no other weapon could deal true damage.

A celestial Deva at the Temple of Oghma revealed the ritual to cleanse the weapon: four ingredients — a black opal, moonstone dust, an enchanted mithril mallet, and a hag's tooth — combined under a full moon to draw the hag bound within the dagger into the open, where it could be slain. The group has acquired several of the ingredients, including the hag's tooth — knocked from a hag's face by Buumi's thrown hammer during the destruction of Old Bonegrinder.

## The Drow in Disguise

Patches' Drow heritage is a constant complication on the surface. She hid her nature when the group first entered Neverwinter, knowing the suspicion her kind provokes. An older woman at the festival blanched upon realizing she was looking at a Drow and hurried away. [[Myria Brightlance]], wounded and delirious in the labyrinth, sneered at Patches when she approached — assuming treachery. Patches simply told her she was out of her league and should go home.

Yet she weaponizes her heritage with devastating effect. In the celestial vault's forest trial, she disappeared into the bushes and emerged in the revealing robes of a Drow priestess. With Mr. Pickles at her side, she marched up to a Balgura demon and demanded — by order of [[Lolth]] — to be taken to its master. The bluff worked. She negotiated with a Glabrezu and Chasme demon, secured their key, and walked out breathing considerably easier.

## Bregan D'aerthe

Patches was formerly an agent of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] — the Drow mercenary organization that operates across the surface world — before entering the service of Lady Faye. She recognized [[Raylen]]'s Bregan D'aerthe coin at the Neverwinter festival and used her knowledge to talk the group down from burning his tent after a poisoned crossbow bolt nearly killed [[Lothli]]. When [[Lo'Dan]] revealed himself and his Drow warriors materialized from the walls of the Moonstone Mask, he welcomed the group warmly and told Patches how much they all missed her. She responded by demanding a slap on Raylen for poisoning the group — then revealed her glove was itself poisoned, paralyzing him on the spot. She kicked him several times while the other Drow looked on in amusement.

## Finn

Patches has a son named Finn — around twenty-two years old — whom she left in the Moonwood two decades ago. She had not seen him since. During the campaign, Finn was kidnapped in a Drow attack on the Moonwood and taken into the Underdark, where he was dressed in Drow noble attire with his hair cut to denote his station. He showed the powers of both a wizard and a sorcerer.

When Patches reached him through a dream, his face contorted with a range of emotions. He marched close to her and screamed into her face: *LIAR!* The identity of Finn's father remains a mystery to the group, though [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] and [[Fëanon Sërindë|Fëanon]] have both privately bet it is Lo'Dan.

## The Establishment

Aliyah operates [[The Establishment]] — a bustling underworld complex of inn, brothel, and casino at a crossroads within the Barony. It serves as both a business venture and a way to cement her network of connections among the shady underbelly of the region. She maintains a strict code of conduct and does not tolerate violence within its walls.

## From Loner to Family

Patches' arc across the campaign is one of reluctant integration. In the early days, she preferred independent action — sniping from distance, shadowing the group from afar, scouting alone. Over time, the tea service became a ritual, the tree-climbing watches with Fëanon became trust, and the dark sacrifices to feed the Reaver became shared burdens. By the time she revealed her Bregan D'aerthe past and her abandoned son to the group, the transformation was complete — from lone operative to someone who asks [[Tarkathee Daru|Tark]] for parenting advice.

## Relationships

Aliyah's relationship with [[Horatio Von Bumidere|Buumi]] is one of the group's longest-running threads. Drawn to each other despite vastly different temperaments, they have danced around mutual attraction for years. The stakes deepened when Patches proposed a marriage — framed as a binding protection pact for their children, Finn and Cercei, in the eyes of noble houses and their gods. When Buumi decided to stay behind during the Underdark expedition, Patches was genuinely upset but understood — eventually handing over Neero's blade as a gesture of trust.

Her closest platonic bond is with [[Fëanon Sërindë|Fëanon]] — they climbed a tree together on watch during the group's earliest days, and their trust deepened through infiltrations and shared dangers. She asked Tark who should teach Finn wizardry, and Tark advised her that Fëanon was the right choice — noting it was the group's job to keep the wizard grounded.
