Al Askar is an alien world with twin suns, accessed through the ancient Ringed Veil portal network. It serves as the primary setting for the later chapters of the campaign, offering a dramatically different landscape from Faerûn.

The world features desert landscapes, coastal cities like Ras Alkan, the vast Thueba Swamp, and the city of Iyum — the largest settlement, ruled by Sultan Bashir and the Usurpers of Rudjek. The Cult of Zalaam (servants of Vecna) and the Obsidian Order (desert elves fighting against them) vie for control of the world's fate.
