The Thundercannon is Gundren Rockseeker's signature weapon, an artificed firearm of devastating power that has been his primary instrument of destruction since the earliest days of the party's adventures. The weapon fires explosive shells capable of killing demons in a single critical hit, blasting open frozen doors, and raining destruction on enemies from aerial positions atop his winged owlbear mount Arkto. Over time, Gundren has continued to modify and improve the weapon, adding an underslung grenade launcher and other enhancements.

The Thundercannon has become iconic in the campaign, with Gundren's fighting style built around combining aerial mobility with the weapon's long-range firepower. Its distinctive reports have signaled the dwarf's presence in countless battles, from the Underdark to the Barony's defense to the deserts of Al Askar. The weapon drew admiring attention from the dwarven smith Dogran, who expressed eagerness to see what the Rockseeker Manufactory would produce in the future.
