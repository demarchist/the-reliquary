Gravenhollow is a legendary demi-plane of earth housing an enormous library maintained by three Stone Giant archivists. The library contains knowledge spanning all planes of existence, organized into chambers of Past, Present, and Future.

The demi-plane is guarded by a Basilisk named Veldyskar and can be summoned using an ancient red-stone ring. The party visits Gravenhollow to gain crucial knowledge about the threats they face — including the locations of the Last Word fragments and the plans of their enemies.
