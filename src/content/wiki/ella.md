Ella is a highly skilled Harper agent in her late twenties, raised and trained by the Harpers from a young age. She possesses a diverse skill set encompassing combat, espionage, and subterfuge, with a particular talent for adapting quickly to new environments and roles.

## Appearance

Ella has a lithe, athletic build honed by years of rigorous training. Her sharp, observant eyes are a deep green, often hidden behind carefully crafted expressions that rarely betray her true thoughts. Her rich auburn hair is usually kept in a practical braid or bun.

## Personality

Initially, Ella presents as coolly professional, focused, and detached — a perfect agent capable of compartmentalizing her emotions. However, beneath this exterior lies a woman grappling with doubts about her purpose and the morality of her actions. She has a dry, sometimes dark sense of humor that surfaces in tense situations, and she is deeply introspective and observant.

## Journey

Ella's rigid worldview begins to crack through her experiences at the JMJM Theater, her unexpected connection with JmJm, and her time with Tark. These relationships challenge her ingrained isolation and push her toward personal growth. Despite her training to avoid attachments, she forms meaningful connections that transform her from a weapon wielded by others into a woman forging her own path — carrying the weight of her past actions while striving toward a more ethically grounded future.
