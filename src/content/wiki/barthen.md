Elmar Barthen is the owner of Barthen's Provisions, the general store in Phandalin. He is an associate of the Rockseeker brothers and the party's original employer — they were hired to deliver a wagon of supplies from Neverwinter to his shop.

When the party arrived and informed Barthen that his associate Gundren Rockseeker had been kidnapped, he offered 150 gold pieces for Gundren's safe return and loaned the party his wagon and oxen to aid in their search.
