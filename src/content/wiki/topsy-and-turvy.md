Topsy and Turvy are were-rat siblings who serve as the primary administrators of the Fane of Selune, overseeing its day-to-day operations on behalf of Cirrus Al Kayan. They were among Cirrus' initial converts to the Cult of Selune.

## Divergent Views

Despite their shared faith, the siblings have cultivated profoundly differing perspectives on religious dogma. While one sibling adheres to more conventional religious ideals, the other has adopted a decidedly more radical stance, characterized by participation in self-mutilating religious rituals. This divergence creates an unusual dynamic within the Fane's administration.
