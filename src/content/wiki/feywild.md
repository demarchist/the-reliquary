The Feywild is a parallel plane of existence that mirrors the Material Plane but is suffused with vibrant, untamed magical energy. Colors are brighter, emotions more intense, and the natural world grows with exuberant, almost aggressive vitality. It is home to the fey creatures: pixies, sprites, satyrs, eladrin, and the powerful archfey who rule domains of breathtaking beauty and terrible danger. Time flows differently in the Feywild, and visitors may return to find that years have passed in moments, or moments in years.

The party has encountered the Feywild's influence in multiple contexts, from the Bog and its fey inhabitants to the Summer Sidhe in the Underdark. In Al Askar, one of the potential routes back to Faerûn lay through that world's version of the Feywild, and the party had to weigh the risks of traversing this unpredictable realm against other options for returning home.
