Tark's Treehouse is situated high up in a towering oak deep in the forests of Thunder Bluff. It is an elaborate structure cobbled together from an assortment of boards, ropes, canvas, and other found materials — reflecting Tark's creative and resourceful nature.

## Layout

The treehouse has multiple levels anchored to several thick branches of the massive oak trunk, connected by rope bridges, ladders, and ropes:

- **Main living space** — A hodgepodge of mismatched furniture and eclectic decor gathered from Tark's adventures, with brightly colored tapestries, exotic masks, weapons, piles of pillows, and hammocks
- **Kitchen** — A stone hearth with makeshift counters and shelves stocked with food from the forest
- **Library** — Shelves crammed with scrolls and books, some neatly ordered, others strewn haphazardly
- **Meditation room** — The highest room, with windows open to the forest on all sides, cushions and incense burners, and a small herb garden outside
- **Guest quarters** — Sleeping spaces for visitors

The somewhat precarious construction echoes Tark's carefree, wandering lifestyle. Though disorganized and messy at times, the treehouse radiates charm and reflects the joy Tark takes in his simple life.
