The drow, or dark elves, are a subterranean elven race that dwells primarily in the Underdark. Cast out from the surface world millennia ago in the Crown Wars, the drow built a civilization of terrible beauty and cruelty beneath the earth, dominated by the worship of Lolth the Spider Queen. Drow society is matriarchal and ruthlessly competitive, with noble houses constantly scheming against one another for power and the favor of their dark goddess.

The drow have been a persistent presence throughout the campaign, from the party's imprisonment in Velkynvelve under Ilvara Mizzrym to the political intrigues of Menzoberranzan and House Faen Tlabbar. Patches (Aliyah Faen Tlabbar) is herself a drow, and her complex relationship with her people has driven much of her personal story. Not all drow serve Lolth; some, like the followers of Eilistraee, seek redemption and a return to the surface world.
