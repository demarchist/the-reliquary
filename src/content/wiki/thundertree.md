Thundertree is a desolate town ravaged by volcanic eruptions some thirty years ago. Now largely abandoned, it is infested with twig blights and home to the green dragon Venomfang, who lairs in the old mage's tower.

The druid Reidoth lives here and provides the party with crucial information, including the location of Cragmaw Castle and warnings about the dragon. The party's encounter with Venomfang in Thundertree sets in motion events that ultimately lead to the Dracolich attack on Phandalin.
