Auril, the Frostmaiden, is the goddess of winter's harshest aspects: bitter cold, killing storms, and the predatory hunger that comes with the frozen months. She is a cruel and capricious deity, demanding tribute from those who wish to survive her season. Her clergy frequently extort communities in exchange for the promise of milder winters, making her worship a blend of devotion and fear across the northern reaches of Faerûn.

The Sage Beryan provided the party with detailed information about Auril during their research into divine threats. Thorna's connection to the goddess and the magical hammer Issgard prompted significant investigation into the Frostmaiden's nature, with Beryan sending inquiries to the libraries of Evermeet for further knowledge.
