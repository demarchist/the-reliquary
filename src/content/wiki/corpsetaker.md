The Corpsetaker is an ancient entity capable of possessing living bodies to carry out its dark purposes. It orchestrates coordinated attacks on the party, including the assault on the Bumidere Estate in Neverwinter where it possesses the body of a young girl named Cercei.

The Corpsetaker's ability to jump between hosts makes it an elusive and terrifying foe. It maintains connections to other villains including Li Xian the Oni and various Amnian operatives, and continues to pose a threat even after individual encounters are resolved.
