Theodemir was a powerful wizard and Fey'Anon's mentor, who sacrificed his very life force to cast the spell that kept the lich Zhengyi the Witch-King sealed away. His spirit was preserved within Fey's Ring of Mind Shielding after the party managed to expel an Atropal fragment that had been corrupting the ring. From within the ring, Theodemir continued to guide and teach his star pupil, imparting knowledge of time and space magic that allowed Fey to develop new spells.

Theodemir warned that the spell restraining Zhengyi had been failing for a year as a greater power worked to unravel it, giving him only nineteen hours before the enchantment collapsed entirely. Despite the urgency, Theodemir used his remaining time to share crucial magical knowledge with Fey, including insights that led to the creation of the spell Manipulate Mass. His spirit is slowly degrading within the ring, with months before it becomes critical, though he slumbers more as the degradation progresses.
