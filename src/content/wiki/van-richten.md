Van Richten is an elderly but formidable vampire hunter — one of the most experienced in the known world — operating in Barovia under the disguise of a flamboyant bard named Rictavio. Beneath the colourful persona lies a hardened killer with decades of undead-slaying expertise and a personal vendetta against the creatures of the night.

## In Barovia

Van Richten's disguise as Rictavio fooled most of Vallaki, though the party eventually unmasked him during the Festival of the Blazing Sun. He became a key ally, sharing intelligence on Strahd's forces and the valley's dangers. His apprentice Ezmerelda searched for him across Barovia, and finding traces of his work at Argynvostholt led her to the party.

Van Richten was captured during the group's time in the valley and imprisoned in the dungeons beneath Castle Ravenloft. By the time Tark found his cell, it was too late — two puncture wounds on his neck told the story. Van Richten's eyes snapped open, fangs gleaming, skin pallid. He recognised the monk and begged to be killed. Tark gripped his holy staff, impaled the old man through the heart, and sawed through his neck until the head came free and crumbled to dust.

## Legacy

Van Richten's death hit the group hard, particularly Ezmerelda. After the fall of Barovia and the destruction of Strahd, Fëanon told her that the old hunter went out exactly as he would have wanted — and that the mantle of vampire hunter now fell to her. Ezmerelda accepted the burden, departing into the wider world to carry on her master's work.
