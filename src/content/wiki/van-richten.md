Van Richten is an elderly but formidable vampire hunter operating in Barovia under the disguise of a flamboyant bard named Rictavio. His decades of experience hunting undead make him an invaluable ally in the campaign against Strahd Von Zarovich.

His apprentice Ezmerelda searches for him across Barovia, and their eventual reunion strengthens the party's efforts against the vampire lord.
