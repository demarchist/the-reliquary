The Megascope is a holographic communication device gifted to the party by the Harpell family. It consists of three brass tripods with mounted brass spheres, crystals, lenses, and gears atop a marble slab.

The device can contact other megascopes for long-distance communication and also functions as an astral meditation focus. It serves as the party's primary means of staying in contact with allies across great distances throughout the campaign.
