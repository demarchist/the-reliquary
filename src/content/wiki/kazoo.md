Kazoo is a cat-creature strikingly similar in appearance to [[Doc|Doctor Breakfast]] — the resemblance strong enough that they may actually be related. She works as the bouncer for the cauldron shop in [[Goblin Town]], where she guards the Goblin Bog Brew with the authority of someone carrying an enormous battleaxe and no patience for nonsense. Her first words to the group were to tell them to piss off.

She has a singular weakness: clams. [[Demetrius]] — who is visibly afraid of Kazoo and her axe — told the group as much, and when [[Doc|Doctor Breakfast]] presented her with a bucket of them, Kazoo's demeanour shifted entirely. The two discovered they might be gnome-sisters, separated by the demiplane's distorting influence.

Kazoo joined the group's war party when they marched on the labyrinth to rescue [[Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews|JmJm]], though like everyone else in the Bog, her primary motivation was that the [[The Goblin King|Goblin King]] had wronged her.
