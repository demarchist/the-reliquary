---

Fëanon's Tower is an enormous structure built into the rocky prominence of Sërindë Isle. Its elegant spire reaches eight hundred feet into the sky — a testament to its creator's power, philosophy, and mastery of the arcane arts. As an "Up-wizard," Fëanon built his tower to be seen, to inspire, and to serve as a beacon of knowledge and arcane learning.

## Structure

The tower is predominantly round, constructed from finely hewn and finished stone by skilled dwarven architects. It consists of fifty above-ground floors and a large relic chamber in the basement called The Reliquary. The floors contain a mix of living quarters, libraries, laboratories, workshops, and specialized rooms for the study and practice of magic.

## The Entrance Hall

The ground floor is entirely dedicated to a grand Entrance Hall — a circular space fifty feet high with domed ceilings. Massive fifty-foot iron-and-gold double doors open into an interior adorned with magical relief sculptures depicting key events in Fëanon's life. The polished dark gray marble floor is veined with gold, and enchanted strips of glowing material provide dramatic yet welcoming illumination.

## Notable Floors

- **Floors 45–47**: Highly confidential cloning and consciousness-transfer facilities — Fëanon's secret project to achieve immortality
- **Floor 48**: Fëanon's Laboratory, filled with arcane instruments and powerful artifacts
- **Floor 49**: Fëanon's private chambers, spacious and lavishly decorated
- **Floor 50**: The Observation Deck, offering stunning panoramic views through enchanted, damage-proof glass

## Security

Rather than guards and physical barriers, the tower is protected by a complex network of Antipathy and Sympathy enchantments keyed to color-coded visitor badges. Unauthorized visitors find themselves unknowingly guided away from restricted areas, while authorized personnel are drawn toward their intended destinations. The result is a tower that appears entirely unsecured — an illusion that conceals defenses far more effective than any physical security.
