Sërindë Isle is a small, wind-swept island far from the major trade routes of the known world. It serves as the home of the wizard Fëanon Sërindë and the seat of The Reliquary.

The isle's remoteness has proven both a blessing and a challenge — while it remains safe from the wars and upheavals that periodically sweep the mainland, its acolytes must work tirelessly to gather and verify accounts from distant lands.
