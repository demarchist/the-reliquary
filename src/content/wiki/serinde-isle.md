Sërindë Isle is a rocky and densely forested island in the middle of Lake Seluna, named in honor of Fëanon Sërindë. It lies within the political boundaries of the Barony of Thunder Bluff. The only way to reach the island is by boat.

## Fëanon's Tower

The island's dominant feature is Fëanon's enormous tower, built into the rocky prominence of the isle. The tower's elegant spire reaches eight hundred feet into the sky and houses fifty above-ground floors of libraries, laboratories, workshops, and living quarters — as well as a basement relic chamber called The Reliquary.

## The Courtyard

The base of the tower is surrounded by a courtyard that tastefully incorporates the natural landscape of the island into its design, including gardens and outdoor spaces influenced by elven aesthetics. At night, the courtyard is lit by floating magical lanterns, creating a place of elegant beauty with graceful columns, intricate carvings, and a sense of harmony and balance.
