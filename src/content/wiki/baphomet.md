Baphomet, the Horned King, is the demon lord of minotaurs, savagery, and labyrinths. His layer of the Abyss, the Endless Maze, is a sprawling labyrinth that shifts and changes with his dark will. Baphomet delights in the hunt, stalking prey through his ever-changing corridors, and his minotaur servants carry this predatory instinct into the mortal world. He is locked in an eternal rivalry with Yeenoghu, and the two demon lords despise each other above all other enemies.

Baphomet's influence extends into the Underdark, where his corruption can twist passages into maddening mazes and turn beasts into savage killers. The Labyrinth that the party encountered bears the hallmarks of his chaotic domain.
