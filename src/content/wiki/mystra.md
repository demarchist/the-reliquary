Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries, is the goddess of magic and the guardian of the Weave, the invisible fabric of raw magic that permeates all of Toril and allows spellcasters to channel arcane power. Without Mystra's stewardship, magic itself would become wild and unpredictable, as it did during the periods when the goddess was slain. Several mortals have held the mantle of Mystra over the ages, each ascending to maintain the crucial balance of magical energy.

Mystra's influence touches every wizard, sorcerer, and arcane practitioner in the Realms, whether they worship her directly or not. The Weave she maintains is the foundation upon which all arcane magic is built, making her one of the most important deities in the pantheon. The Netherese archwizard Karsus once attempted to steal her power, an act that caused catastrophic devastation.
