Wave Echo Cave is an ancient cave system in the Sword Mountains, containing the remains of ancient dwarven mining operations and the legendary Spellforge — a green glowing energy vortex atop a pedestal.

The Black Spider (Nezzan) infiltrated the cave searching for the Spellforge, having stolen the wardstone from the Rockseeker brothers. The party fights through the cave's dangers, defeats Nezzan, and witnesses the Spellforge flare and die, transforming into a Jade Frog Golem. The cave is also guarded by the wraith of the ancient wizard Mormesk and the Spectators Igi and Gladi.
