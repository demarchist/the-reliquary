Baldur's Gate is a large coastal city where the party arrives by ship during the third chapter of their adventures. The city is suffering from the spreading undead mists and is protected by the Flaming Fist mercenary company along with an augmented city guard.

The party's time in Baldur's Gate involves dealings with Lady Faye, confrontations with the fanatical Brotherhood cult, and an encounter with the Duergar leader Veygar who impersonates Lord Faendral to lure them into a trap.
