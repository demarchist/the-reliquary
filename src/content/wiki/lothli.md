Lothli is a Wood Elf Ranger who joins the group with her tamed wolves. She participates extensively in combat, scouting, and tournaments throughout the early chapters of the campaign.

During the Neverwinter Refounding Festival martial tournament, Lothli is defeated by Hendrell, the Champion of the Moonwood — a loss that sparks an unexpected infatuation with the elven champion.
