## Description

Shatterpeak is a dramatically split mountain in the northern reaches of Faerûn. Within its fractured interior lies the Sanctum of Krasus, an ancient Netherese tower containing powerful magical artifacts. The mountain also hosts a frost giant settlement led by the matriarch Ingrbotha.

## Significance

The party's expedition to Shatterpeak, guided by Megno Slatesunder, yields discoveries of immense importance including the Mythallar, Crystal Tuning Fork, and other Netherese artifacts. The frost giant community provides both challenges and allies during the party's time on the mountain.
