Mediocris Dente is the creature behind the children's legend of the tooth fairy — and the reality is far uglier than the tale. A Wild Fae Archfey, winged and gaunt, its neck and body draped in necklaces of teeth, Mediocris Dente is the kind of patron that takes everything and gives just enough to keep its warlock crawling back.

Cyrrus Al Kayan served under this creature's pact. The terms were humiliating: regular payments of treasure and a tooth placed under his pillow each night. Every night, Cyrrus dreamed the same dream — trapped in a desolate expanse of blackness, a plane of water stretching endlessly as the only floor. There, the Tooth Fairy would whisper to him and accept his offerings. If pleased, it returned small gifts — a ring of protection, scraps of power. If not, Cyrrus remained alone in the dreamscape, fully conscious, for hours.

[[Horatio Von Bumidere|Buumi]] discovered the nature of Cyrrus's patron through divine insight in the ruins beneath [[Baldur's Gate]] and was deeply disturbed. The group chose to press forward rather than intervene, but the knowledge sat poorly with everyone.

## Death

When the Bog demiplane began collapsing after the [[The Goblin King|Goblin King]]'s defeat, Mediocris Dente emerged from a portal — perhaps drawn by the chaos, perhaps fleeing like everything else. Cyrrus saw the creature and snapped. Something deeper than anger took hold. In ape form, he went into a frenzy, crushing goblins underfoot and hurling boulders at his former master. Buumi rode to his side and together they brought the Tooth Fairy down. Cyrrus, still a great ape, smashed the creature's head flat with a giant amethyst.

The pact was broken. Whatever Mediocris Dente had been — patron, tormentor, parasite — Cyrrus ended it himself, with his own hands. It was the most decisive thing the warlock had ever done.
