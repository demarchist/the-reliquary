Mediocris Dente is a Wild Fae and Archfey who serves as a patron to Cirrus Al Kayan. A sinister being, Mediocris Dente collects payment from mortals through offerings of teeth and treasure. The entity is the legendary basis for the Tooth Fairy myth, though the reality is far more unsettling than the children's tale.
