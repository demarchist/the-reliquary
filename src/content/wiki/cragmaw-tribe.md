The Cragmaw Tribe is a goblin tribe that operates out of multiple strongholds in the region around Phandalin, including the Cragmaw Hideout and the more formidable Cragmaw Castle. Under the direction of the Black Spider, goblins of the Cragmaw Tribe ambushed travelers along the Triboar Trail and kidnapped Gundren Rockseeker.

The bugbear Klarg commanded the Cragmaw Hideout, holding prisoners and stolen goods for the Spider. When the party infiltrated the hideout, they cleared out the goblins and tricked Klarg into surrendering his loot.
