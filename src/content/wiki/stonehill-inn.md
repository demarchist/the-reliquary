The Stonehill Inn is a tavern and lodging house in Phandalin, run by innkeeper Toblen Stonehill. Sildar headed here to rest after his rescue from the Cragmaw Hideout. The party's bard earned the group free room and board with a performance, and the inn became their base of operations in town. It was here that the party overheard rumors of a halfling child who had found a secret tunnel into the Redbrand hideout beneath Tresendar Manor.
