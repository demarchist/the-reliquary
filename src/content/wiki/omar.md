General Omar is an Amnian military commander — an older man in his fifties with a huge bristly grey moustache, serious dark eyes and rich armour beneath a white turban and gold helm. He leads from horseback and carries himself with the gravity of a professional soldier who has seen too many bad decisions made by politicians.

The group first encountered Omar after the Illithid hive's destruction, when his two-hundred-strong force had been devastated by the colony's sentry golems, leaving barely thirty survivors. The group healed as many as they could, and Omar was saddened but immensely grateful. When Abdul Al Suyuuk arrived and tried to order an attack on the group, Omar was instrumental in talking him down. As the group departed, Omar tossed a ring to Cyrrus as a token of gratitude.

During the Battle for Silverymoon, Omar led the Amnian army through the gates — a thousand strong — but conducted himself with restraint. He promised Tark that no civilians would be harmed and that the intent was to secure Amnian holdings, not start a massacre. His soldiers largely followed those orders, using blunt edges and shields against the citizenry.

The true measure of Omar's character was revealed in the aftermath. Abdul had ordered his own men to stab Omar in the back during the confusion of battle. The General survived with multiple wounds and was brought out of the surrendering army by his loyalists. Buumi rushed to heal him. Disgusted by the attempted assassination, the group ensured that Arasume treated Omar well in custody — a courtesy the High Marshal granted willingly.
