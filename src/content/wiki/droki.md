Droki is a Derro warlock who operated as a courier moving between the West Cleft and the Blade Bazaar in Gracklstugh. The Flameguard were actively seeking him when the party was tasked with his capture. Cirrus intercepted the smaller and weaker warlock, intimidating him into compliance and demanding a meeting with his master, Bilrigger the Savant, one of the Council of Savants that governed the Derro underbelly of the city.

After capturing Droki, Cirrus performed an hour-long ritual to dedicate the reluctant Derro to Selûné, stripping him of his warlock powers in the process. Droki provided intelligence about the Council of Savants, revealing they were composed of many warlocks with patrons ranging from Archfey to Demons and Devils. Left broken-armed, powerless, and despondent after the ritual, Droki initially fled but was coaxed back by Patches, who offered healing and a discussion about his future.
