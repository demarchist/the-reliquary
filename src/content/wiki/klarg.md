Klarg is a bugbear who commanded the Cragmaw Hideout, a goblin-infested cave system along the Triboar Trail south of Neverwinter. He operated under the authority of the Black Spider, holding captured prisoners and stolen goods.

When the party infiltrated the hideout, they snuck down a chute to ambush Klarg from behind. Rather than fight, they charmed the bugbear and convinced him they were agents of the Black Spider. Klarg obligingly carried his own loot out for them and surrendered a goblin slave before the party moved on toward Phandalin.
