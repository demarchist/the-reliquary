Ceregorach, the Laughing God, is a trickster deity whose domain encompasses cunning, humor, and deception used for benevolent ends. Unlike malicious trickster gods, Ceregorach's jests serve a greater purpose, often humbling the proud and revealing hidden truths through laughter and misdirection. His followers tend to be entertainers, jesters, and those who use wit as their sharpest weapon.

Little is known about the Laughing God's direct involvement in mortal affairs, but his influence can be felt in the unpredictable nature of fate and the cosmic irony that seems to follow adventurers who take themselves too seriously.
