Dokkar is an extra-planar city of good-aligned Dark Elves devoted to the goddess Elistraee, located in Svartalfheim on the plane of Ysgard. Unlike the treacherous Drow cities of the Underdark, Dokkar represents what Dark Elf civilization could be — a place of art, community, and devotion to a benevolent deity.

The city is accessed through magical means including a Well of Many Worlds. It contains the Penitent Gardens, the Cathedral of Twilight, and the workshops of artisans like Madame Toux who crafts Moonweave cloth. Finn eventually resides here, and Patches discovers connections to her ancestor Kallista, a priestess of both Elistraee and Selune.
