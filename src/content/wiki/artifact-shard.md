The Celestial Artifact Shard is one of five pieces of an ancient radiant artifact, hidden in a celestial vault beneath Neverwinter's Chasm. The shard has the power to drive back the necromantic mists that plague the world.

After the party recovers the shard, it is incorporated into Buumi's shield. Orcus seeks to collect all five shards, and his servants — including Kangaxx — are dispatched to seize them. The existence of the other four shards and their locations drive much of the campaign's overarching quest.
