Harold Ophrella was the commander of High Hold when the Orcish Horde swept through the region two years prior, destroying the castle and killing its garrison. His spirit remained bound to the ruins — a well-dressed, ghostly man leaning over a phantom desk in his shattered office, open to the night sky, the actual furniture lying broken beneath a layer of snow.

Harold's haunting was not malicious but tragic. He was stuck in a loop of duty, alternating between not paying attention to visitors and not understanding their words. His spectral guards still patrolled the walls, gazing out over the Evermoor, and one stood sentry at the keep entrance. The ghosts had been hurting the Orc tribe whenever they were spotted — not out of hatred, but because Harold's garrison was still defending against an invasion that had already succeeded.

Cyrrus broke through by framing the situation in terms the ghost could process: they were from Silverymoon, they were assuming command, and Harold's people were to evacuate to safety. The simple act of being relieved of his post — of hearing that reinforcements had finally come — was enough. Harold sighed with relief and evaporated. The spectres passed on with him.
