The Well of Many Worlds is a legendary magical item that appears as a fine black cloth about 6 feet in diameter. When placed on a solid surface, it creates a two-way portal to another plane of existence, chosen either randomly or through the will of the user. This extraordinarily rare and powerful artifact allows instantaneous travel between the planes, making it one of the most coveted items in the multiverse.

The Well's ability to bridge the gap between planes makes it an object of immense strategic value, particularly for a group like the Spellforged who have traveled extensively across multiple planes and dimensions. The portals created by the Well are temporary but reliable, offering a means of escape or access that few other magical items can match.
