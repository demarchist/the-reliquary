Amn is a powerful mercantile nation located south of the Sword Coast, governed by the Council of Six, a shadowy ruling body whose members' identities are officially secret. The nation's wealth is built on trade, with Amnian merchants and caravans reaching every corner of Faerûn. Amn's capital, Athkatla, is a city of immense prosperity, but the nation's pursuit of profit often puts it at odds with its neighbors.

Amn has been a significant antagonist in the campaign, launching a coup attempt in Silverymoon and sending diplomatic delegations to Helm's Hold with mixed intentions. The Amnian retainers Gneiss and Chani initially fought against the party during the Silverymoon invasion before defecting after the assassination attempt at the Bumidere estate. The party has had to navigate Amnian political machinations throughout their efforts to build alliances across the North.
