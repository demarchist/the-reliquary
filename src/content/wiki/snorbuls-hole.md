Snorbul's Hole is a labyrinthine complex of underground tunnels and chambers located within the Barony of Thunder Bluff. It is owned, operated, and championed by Snorbul himself.

## Surface

At surface level, Snorbul's Hole is an unassuming, unadorned hole in the ground surrounded by piles of dirt and stones — giving no hint of the bustling complex below.

## Underground

Beneath the surface, Snorbul's Hole is a hive of activity centered around spectated martial competitions. Some matches follow rules strictly enforced by Snorbul and his associates, while others are no-holds-barred cage matches to the death. In either case, the denizens are a famously rowdy crowd and gambling is strongly encouraged.

As a "Down-wizard" style complex (though built by a Barbarian rather than a wizard), Snorbul's Hole reflects its creator's preference for underground spaces and his Svirfneblin heritage.
