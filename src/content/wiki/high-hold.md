## Description

High-Hold, also known as Moorwatch, is a ruined castle that was destroyed two years before the party's arrival. The ruins are now inhabited by an Orc tribe led by Luumsh, with the ghost of the former commander Harold Ophrella still haunting its halls.

## Significance

The party negotiates with Luumsh's orcs and encounters Harold Ophrella's ghost, learning about the castle's history and the events that led to its destruction. The site lies near Old Kossenberg at the base of Thunder Bluff.
