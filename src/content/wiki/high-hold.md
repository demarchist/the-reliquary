High-Hold — known locally as Moorwatch — is a ruined castle perched atop the thousand-foot cliff of Thunder Bluff, overlooking the thunderous rapids of the river Rauvin. Destroyed two years prior by the Orcish Horde during their devastating sweep through the region, the castle's walls are broken, its keep partially collapsed, and its corridors open to the sky.

## The Orc Occupation

After the war, a tribe of Orc deserters led by Luumsh sheltered in caves beneath the bluff until a spirit troll called Shadowclaw drove them to the surface. The tribe settled in the ruins for the winter, using the old barracks as shelter. Despite their dire circumstances — wounded, haunted by spectres and barely surviving — Luumsh maintained order and proved willing to negotiate when the group arrived.

## The Haunting

The ruins were haunted by several spectres and the ghost of Harold Ophrella, the castle's last commander, who had been killed when the Horde attacked. Harold lingered in his shattered office, still going through the motions of command, alternating between inattention and confusion. Cyrrus managed to get through to the ghost by framing the situation in terms Harold could understand — reinforcements from Silverymoon had arrived, and his people were to evacuate. Harold sighed with relief and passed on, taking the spectres with him.

## The Caverns

Beneath the bluff, a network of caves descends into the earth. The entrance lies at the river level, accessible via a narrow stone stairway cut into the cliff face. Two tunnels at the back of the main cavern lead into the Upper-Dark — a dangerous transitional zone between the surface and the Underdark. The group plans to have Gundren seal these tunnels to prevent incursion.
