Thunder Bluff is a massive rocky prominence that towers over the surrounding region on the continent of Faerûn. It is situated on the shore of the mighty River Rauvin along the Trade Way between Neverwinter and Silverymoon, overlooking a vast marsh called The Evermoors to the south. The village of Kossenberg lies to the north, and beyond it the magical forest known as the Moonwood.

## The Barony

Thunder Bluff and the entire region for miles around lies within the political boundaries of an independent polity called the Barony of Thunder Bluff. The Barony is governed by a council of powerful adventurers who call themselves the Faerûn Defense Force — though their detractors know them as the Heralds of Woe.

## Notable Landmarks

The Barony contains numerous notable locations, including the Keep of Thunder Bluff atop the bluff itself, Lake Seluna and Sërindë Isle, the Fane of Selune, The Establishment, Snorbul's Hole, Tark's Treehouse, and the JMJM Theater. It is a place of great beauty and natural wonder, home to many different creatures and beings.
