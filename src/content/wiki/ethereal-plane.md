The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-filled dimension that exists as a border between the Material Plane and the Inner Planes. Creatures on the Ethereal Plane can see into the Material Plane as ghostly, translucent images, and vice versa under certain magical conditions. The plane serves as a conduit for travel between dimensions and is home to ghosts, phase spiders, and other creatures that exist between states of reality.

The Ethereal Plane played a critical role during the battle against Hohonu in Al Askar. JmJm and Tark witnessed the ancient dragon's prison erupting in the Ethereal Plane as the Great Wyrm attempted to pull itself free. Tark bravely entered the Ethereal to grab the soul of the fallen Camea, storing it in a waterskin while swimming through a cloud of specters near the Death Wyrm. The plane's overlap with reality also allowed Hohonu to project his power through the weakened veil, striking at the party even from within his prison.
