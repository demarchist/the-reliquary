Vaketh is the god of Power in the world of Al Askar, worshipped at a temple perched atop a pillar jutting from a magma lake. The Temple of Vaketh was one of the few sacred sites left undefended by the Shadowfell creatures that guarded the other temples, and the party was drawn there by a prophecy from the Temple of Carthus promising Snorbul great power at Vaketh's shrine.

Vaketh ultimately formed an alliance with Tark, lending the monk his divine intervention during critical battles, including the final confrontation at the Font of Fawden. With his power, Tark's prosthetic arm and eyes glow red, and he gains the ability to fly. As part of their agreement, Vaketh left Al Askar, presumably accompanying Tark back to Faerûn, where the god of Power continues to empower his chosen champion in the ongoing struggle against the forces of darkness.
