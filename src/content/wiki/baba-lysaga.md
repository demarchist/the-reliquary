Baba Lysaga is an immensely powerful witch and high priestess of Atropos who resides in the swampy ruins of Berez — a village she herself annihilated. She serves as the master of Morgantha and the other night hags operating in Barovia, and is Rahadin's secret co-conspirator in maintaining the curse.

## Madness and Power

Lysaga is obsessed with Strahd Von Zarovich, whom she considers her child. In her ramshackle hut — an animated structure that walks on root-like legs — she keeps an illusory baby in a beautiful crib and fawns over it as though it were Strahd himself, praising what the man has become. Her true form is monstrous: skeletal arms far too long for a human, tipped with filthy claws, an elk skull covering her head with huge antlers strung with flayed human skin, and dirty black robes dangling with grisly trophies.

She is a master of deception, projecting a programmed illusion of breathtaking beauty to lure enemies into a central, exposed position before attacking from above on a disembodied giant skull. Her arsenal includes finger of death, fireball, polymorph, and the ability to command druids, zombies, swarms of insects, and twig-blights.

## The Conspiracy

The group identified Lysaga as Rahadin's co-conspirator through a prophetic dream and later confirmed it by using a crystal communication orb found in Rahadin's office in Castle Ravenloft. Cyrrus impersonated Rahadin's voice on the orb and extracted confirmation of their plot. During the final battle, Rahadin referred to Lysaga as his "beloved" — a detail that both horrified and amused the party.

## Death

The battle at Berez was gruelling. Lysaga commanded aberrant druids, the Genoskwa, a night hag, zombie werewolves, swarms of insects, and twig-blights from her floating skull while Fëanon counterspelled her most devastating attacks. After Tark cleaved the skull in two and sent her plummeting, the group fought through waves of defenders until Fëanon incinerated her with a bolt of flame that scattered gore across the swamp.
