The Duergar, or grey dwarves, are a subterranean race of dwarves who dwell deep in the Underdark. Enslaved long ago by the mind flayers, the Duergar eventually won their freedom but were forever changed by the experience, becoming grim, humorless, and cruel. They possess innate psionic abilities, including the power to turn invisible and enlarge themselves, and their society is built around industry, mining, and the exploitation of slave labor.

The party encountered the Duergar extensively during their time in Gracklstugh, the Dark Iron City. From the merchant Hemeth who provided river transport to the Stoneguard and Flameguard military forces, the Duergar represented both allies of convenience and potential threats. The party navigated the city's complex political landscape, dealing with rival factions and corrupt officials while pursuing their goals in the Underdark.
