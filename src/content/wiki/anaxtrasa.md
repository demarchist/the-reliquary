Anaxtrasa is an adult blue dragon who, following the party's liberation of Barovia, claimed Castle Ravenloft as her own domain after it was transported to the Anauroch desert. She typically appears as a blonde elf in a blue gown when interacting with humanoids. Anaxtrasa is the daughter of a dragon with connections to the Storm Giants, a fact she prefers to keep private, as revealed when Aurinax inadvertently mentioned it within earshot of the party.

Anaxtrasa has proven herself a valuable ally to the Spellforged on multiple occasions. She and the gold dragon Aurinax responded to the dragon attack on Neverwinter, engaging an Ancient Red dragon in aerial combat above the city docks and pursuing it when it teleported away. She participated in the Council of Helm's Hold, confirmed the location of Ravenloft castle in the Anauroch, and has been counted among the party's most powerful allies alongside other notable figures such as Lady Faye and Lady Avelyere.
