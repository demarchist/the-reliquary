Foxy Crazy is a small goblin woman with hedgehog quills and a cute snout nose, living in a cramped hovel at the bottom of the staircase that connects the [[Tavern of Doors]] to the [[The Bog|Bog]] below. She occupies the peculiar role of gatekeeper — the last friendly face before the descent into the demiplane, and the first one waiting when survivors come back up.

She is loud, pragmatic, and entirely without pretence. When the group told her they were looking for [[Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews|JmJm]], she warned them that the [[The Goblin King|Goblin King]] had taken him to [[Goblin Town]] and that anyone entering without a disguise never returned. Her solution was a cart full of garbage, which she used to "decorate" the group with enthusiastic pride. [[Horatio Von Bumidere|Buumi]] resisted until he heard about the fate of the undisguised, then grudgingly draped clean bedsheets over himself as a barrier beneath a filthy burlap tarp.

Foxy Crazy fell immediately and completely for Cyrrus Al Kayan. When the warlock dropped his illusion and appeared in his true form — an emaciated blue tiefling covered in filth — she was smitten. The feeling was mutual. Their tryst in her hovel, while the entire group stood outside in garbage waiting in awkward silence, set the tone for the Bog arc's particular brand of comedy.

She also gave the group a riddle that proved essential: *When night turns to day and day to night, you'll find the key with guiding light.* It unlocked the entrance to the labyrinth.

When the Bog collapsed, Foxy Crazy's tower was the escape route — the staircase from Goblin Town led through her home and back to the Tavern of Doors. Whether she survived the demiplane's destruction or escaped along with the group is unclear, but her home was the last door standing.
