Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, is the king of the metallic dragons and the god of justice, honor, and nobility. He opposes the dark goddess Tiamat and her chromatic dragon servants in an eternal struggle between good and evil dragonkind. Bahamut often appears as an old man accompanied by seven gold canaries, who are in truth ancient gold dragons in disguise. His followers champion the cause of the weak and fight against tyranny wherever it is found.

During the Council of Helm's Hold, the party discussed plans involving Bahamut as a potential ally. The Platinum Dragon's influence extends through his metallic dragon servants, including allies like Aurinax and Anaxtrasa who have aided the Spellforged in their battles against the rising darkness.
