## Description

The Iron Tome is a sentient magical spellbook distinguished by its red leather cover, which conceals eleven eyes that open and survey the surroundings when the book is activated. When unfolded for use, it spreads out before its wielder covered in metal lettering. The Tome possesses its own will and intelligence, capable of independently acting to protect and assist its bonded master.

## History

The Iron Tome came into Fëanon's possession in Gracklstugh, in the Underdark. Unable to decipher the book on his own, Fëanon arranged an appointment at The Hall of Sacred Scrolls, where he and an Arcanaloth named Lolanaroth collaborated to translate it. Upon reading the first page, the cover transformed — eleven eyes opening across its surface — revealing the book's sentient nature. It asked after its old master, long dead, and with an influx of arcane power, Fëanon bonded the artifact to himself.

## Capabilities

The Iron Tome serves as Fëanon's primary spellbook and arcane research companion. Working in concert with Theodemir's spirit, the Tome assists with spell development and magical analysis. It has aided in the creation of new spells, including distortion magic and modifications to existing enchantments. The Tome also acts defensively, attempting to shore up its wielder's mental defenses when threatened — as when an Aboleth's psionic assault overwhelmed both the Tome and Theodemir simultaneously.

## Notable Events

The Tome has been used to store magical components, including fused sapphires deposited via Arcane Recall. Its power and rarity have drawn the attention of others — at least one NPC has expressed interest in acquiring it, though Fëanon rebuffed the offer. In the broken world beyond the party's own, Fëanon's open use of the Tome drew warnings from Liara, who cautioned that displaying arcane power so brazenly would invoke ire in a land where magic broke the world.
