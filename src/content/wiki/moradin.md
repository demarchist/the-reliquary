Moradin, the All-Hammer, is the chief deity of the dwarven pantheon and the god of creation, smithing, mining, and protection. Legend holds that Moradin forged the first dwarves from iron and mithral in the heart of a great mountain, breathing life into them with his divine bellows. His faithful revere the craft of smithing above all else, and dwarven temples to Moradin are always built around great forges where the clergy create works of art and utility in his name.

As the patron of dwarves everywhere, Moradin's influence runs deep through Gundren Rockseeker and the dwarven settlements the party has encountered, from Gauntlgrym to the Rockseeker Manufactory. His blessings are felt in every well-forged weapon and carefully constructed stronghold.
