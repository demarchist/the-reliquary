Veygar is a Duergar who first appears as a villain — impersonating Lord Faendral to lure the party into a trap in Baldur's Gate. He controls mechanical spiders and a Stone Golem, and summons an Alhoon through a portal before retreating.

Later in the Underdark, Veygar resurfaces as a member of the Grey Ghosts thieves' guild in Gracksuluth, contacting the group for a rescue mission and eventually becoming an unlikely ally.
