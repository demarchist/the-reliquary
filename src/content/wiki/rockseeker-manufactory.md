The Rockseeker Manufactory is a massive, sprawling industrial complex located within the walls of the Keep of Thunder Bluff. Built by Gundren Rockseeker, it is a hub of industry and innovation where skilled craftsmen and engineers create some of the finest weapons and armor in all of Faerûn.

## Operations

The Manufactory contains forges, foundries, and workshops filled with the sounds of hammering, grinding, and the roar of flames. The air is thick with black smoke and the grounds are coated with coal ash. Wagons loaded with materials are constantly coming and going. Despite the noise and chaos, the complex is well-organized and efficient.

Gundren serves as owner and foreman, and his extended family — renowned for their expertise in metalworking — run the operation with precision and efficiency. The Rockseekers are constantly experimenting with new techniques and materials.

## Economic Impact

The Manufactory is an important part of the economy of Thunder Bluff and a major employer in the region. The Rockseekers are respected members of the community, though they are not known for their generosity nor their willingness to help others.
