Vaelstraza is a young Red Dragon the group encountered lounging in a volcanic hot spring deep in the winter mountains between Sundabar and Silverymoon. Confident and casually dangerous, she introduced herself as a migrant drawn westward by the call of Magaera, the Fire Primordial bound beneath Gauntlgrym.

Despite the inherent tension of sharing a campfire with a chromatic dragon, the encounter proved surprisingly sociable. Vaelstraza was curious rather than hostile, particularly interested in Tark and his draconic connections — though she curled her lip at any mention of Bahamut. She repeatedly deflected Tark's requests for a sparring match, insisting it would be "beneath her," though everyone present understood that the real reason was self-preservation. When she casually mentioned eating one or two of the party, the group chuckled, and she had the sense not to press the point.

The dragon cooked the group's elk dinner with a single breath. She spent the night in conversation and by morning had shifted into the form of a small red-headed halfling girl to study Tark up close. The group advised her that the halfling shape would serve her far better among the dwarves of Gauntlgrym than her true form. She thanked them — genuinely surprised to find small folk worth talking to — transformed back and flew west into the falling snow.
