Toril is the planet upon which the continent of Faerûn, and the majority of the campaign's events, take place. It is one of many worlds within the prime material plane, orbited by a single moon (Selûné's Tears trail behind it) and illuminated by a single sun. Toril's magical nature is governed by the Weave, maintained by the goddess Mystra, and the world has been shaped by countless ages of divine intervention, magical cataclysms, and the rise and fall of civilizations.

Toril is home to a staggering diversity of life, from the frozen north of Icewind Dale to the steaming jungles of Chult, from the bustling cities of the Sword Coast to the ancient ruins beneath the sands of Anauroch. The party's adventures have taken them across vast stretches of Toril and even beyond it, to other planes and alternate worlds like Al Askar and Oerth.
