Hemeth is a Duergar merchant and barge captain who the party freed from Kuo-Toa captivity in exchange for transport on his vessel. Patches struck the deal, and Fey'Anon polymorphed Hemeth into a bat to facilitate his escape while the Kuo-Toa guards shrieked in alarm. His barge became the party's primary means of traversing the Darklake and the waterways leading to the Dark Iron City of Gracklstugh.

Hemeth proved to be a reliable, if pragmatic, ally during the journey. He assisted the party in navigating the dangerous underground waterways, warned them about approaching locks and hazards, and was visibly shaken when they discovered the final lock gates before Gracklstugh had been torn apart. He has a daughter aboard his ship, and his merchant sensibilities often led him to counsel caution over confrontation. Hemeth was later captured by Stoneguard forces during a raid on Veygar's operations, though the party eventually secured his release.
