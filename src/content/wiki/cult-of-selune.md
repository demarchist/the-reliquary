The Cult of Selune is a small but devoted group of followers dedicated to the worship of Selune, the goddess of the moon. It is headquartered at the Fane of Selune and led by Cirrus Al Kayan, who serves as its high priest.

## Practices

The cult is known for its extravagant ceremonies and rituals, which often involve chanting, incense, and the consumption of hallucinogenic substances. It emphasizes personal transformation and enlightenment through devotion to Selune and the cultivation of inner peace and understanding.

## Influence

Despite its small size, the Cult of Selune has significant influence on the Barony of Thunder Bluff, due largely to Cirrus' charisma and the power of his magic. Many in the region turn to the cult for guidance and spiritual fulfillment, and its ceremonies are often attended by large crowds.

## Controversy

The cult is also shrouded in mystery and controversy, attracting skeptics and detractors who view it as a dangerous and misguided group more interested in power and self-aggrandizement than in helping people. The divergent religious views of its administrators, Topsy and Turvy, reflect deeper tensions within the organization.
