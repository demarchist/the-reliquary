The Keep of Thunder Bluff is a formidable fortress standing atop the massive rocky prominence of Thunder Bluff. It was commissioned by the Faerûn Defense Force and built by skilled dwarven architects, engineers, and laborers.

Within its mighty walls stand two notable institutions: the Temple of Helm and the Rockseeker Manufactory. The Keep serves as the military and industrial heart of the Barony of Thunder Bluff.
