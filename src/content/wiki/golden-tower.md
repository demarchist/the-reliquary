## Description

The Golden Tower is a prominent structure in Iyum that formerly served as the residence of the vampire lord Rudjek. After the revolution, it was repurposed but became a site of dark magic rituals conducted by the practitioner Kumuzu Isa in its basement.

## Significance

The party investigates and cleanses the Golden Tower, discovering evidence of Kumuzu Isa's dark rituals and an Efreeti Bottle containing the trapped Insufferable One. The tower's purification represents another step in securing Iyum against supernatural threats.
