## Description

Sundabar is a dwarven citadel in the process of reconstruction after past devastation. Its undercity features the Everfire — a great lava pit surrounded by forges that forms the heart of dwarven industry. The upper city and undercity host various establishments including The Hopping Hair tavern and the Beardless Brawl Hall training ward.

## Significance

Sundabar serves as a major stop for the party during their northern adventures, providing access to dwarven craftsmen, enchanters, and military resources. The Vaultkeeper Darrak Goldhold manages the Northern Clan Vaults within the citadel.
