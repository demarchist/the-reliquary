Argynvost is an ancient silver dragon, long dead, whose ghostly form inhabits the ruined manor of Argynvolsthold in Barovia. He seeks to have his bones returned to his resting place, a quest that ties into the broader effort against Strahd.

His chamberlain Rahadin is revealed to be a silver dragon in humanoid form and Argynvost's brother, adding a layer of draconic intrigue to the Barovia chapter.
