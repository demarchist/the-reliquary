Lorde first appeared as a comedic foil — [[Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews|JmJm]]'s bardic rival, a performer talented enough to match him note for note, accompanied by Gronk, her hulking barbarian backup singer. The rivalry played out in festivals and competitions, all surface-level showmanship. Nobody took it seriously.

The truth was more complicated. Lorde is a Harper agent operating under deep cover, and the rivalry was never the point. The Harpers had identified the [[The Goblin King|Goblin King]] as a threat — a mind-devouring entity seeking to consume JmJm's consciousness and use his body as a vessel to escape into the prime material plane. Lorde was sent to prevent that. She failed, and the Goblin King captured her instead.

## In the Stocks

The group found Lorde locked in the town stocks in [[Goblin Town]], a prisoner on display. She was pragmatic about her situation — not panicked, not self-pitying, just clear-eyed about the facts. She told the group that JmJm was a native of Sigil, that the Goblin King had already taken him into the labyrinth, and that her mount — a purple celestial war-tiger named Borealis — was being held behind the ruined tower. She also mentioned a celestial mount somewhere south of town, giving the group every scrap of useful intelligence she had.

The group chose not to free her immediately, reasoning that it would provoke the entire town. They promised to return. Whether she believed them or not, she accepted it without complaint. Lorde is someone who understands operational reality — sometimes you get left in the stocks while the mission moves forward.
