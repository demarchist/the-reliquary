Daggerford is a small but strategically important town situated on the Trade Way south of Waterdeep, along the banks of the Delimbiyr River. Despite its modest size, Daggerford serves as a vital waypoint for caravans and travelers moving along the Sword Coast, and its duke maintains a small but capable garrison. The town has a long history of punching above its weight, having repelled invasions and survived threats that would have overwhelmed larger settlements.

Daggerford's position on the Trade Way makes it a natural stopping point for adventurers and merchants alike, and its proximity to both Waterdeep and the wilder southern reaches of the Sword Coast ensures a steady flow of news and opportunity through its gates.
