The Last Word is an ancient artifact of Creation, broken into seven fragments scattered across the multiverse. These fragments hold reality-warping power and are central to the conflict between the forces of creation and destruction.

Orcus seeks to reassemble the fragments to achieve ultimate power, while the party races to locate and secure them first. The shards have been dispersed across multiple worlds and planes — some held by dragons, others lost to fallen civilizations, and at least one recovered from the celestial vault beneath Neverwinter's Chasm.

The artifact's name and nature suggest it represents the fundamental power of creation itself — a word spoken at the dawn of existence whose fragmentation threatens the stability of all reality.
