Shar, the Mistress of the Night, is the goddess of darkness, loss, forgetfulness, and the void. She is the twin sister and eternal enemy of Selûné, and where the Moonmaiden brings light and hope, Shar seeks to extinguish all illumination and plunge the world into endless darkness. Shar's followers worship in secret, hiding their devotion behind masks of normalcy while working to undermine the forces of light. Her clergy specialize in shadow magic and the manipulation of memories.

As the dark counterpart to Selûné, Shar represents everything the party stands against. Her eternal war against the Moonmaiden has cosmic implications, and her agents work tirelessly to snuff out the light of the moon wherever Selûné's faithful gather strength.
