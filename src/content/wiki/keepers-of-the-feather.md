The Keepers of the Feather are a secret order of were-ravens sworn to protect the people of Barovia from the tyranny of Strahd Von Zarovich. Operating covertly, they use their shapeshifting abilities to gather intelligence, deliver messages, and aid those who oppose the vampire lord.

The innkeeper Urwen of the Bluewater Inn is among their number. The Keepers prove to be invaluable allies during the party's campaign against Strahd, providing shelter, information, and support at critical moments.
