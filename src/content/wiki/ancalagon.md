Ancalagon the Void is an ancient Black Dragon who seeks Mordenkainen for unknown purposes. He attacks the party in the Evermoors before fleeing south, and later reappears allied with the devils of the Doomstar Legion. His immense power and mysterious agenda make him one of the most dangerous individual threats the party encounters.
