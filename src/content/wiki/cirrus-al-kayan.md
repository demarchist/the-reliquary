Cirrus Al Kayan is an unusually tall and slender Tiefling male and a Divine Soul Sorcerer who derives his magical power from his spiritual connection to Selune, the moon goddess. He is the charismatic leader of the Cult of Selune and a member of the Faerûn Defense Force.

## Appearance

Cirrus is notably tall and slender for a Tiefling. His most distinctive physical feature is his teeth, which have been replaced with shiny, pointed metal dentures.

## Personality

Cirrus can charitably be described as a megalomaniac. His friends might call him self-absorbed or overly zealous; his enemies might describe him as an unhinged lunatic. He steadfastly believes the world revolves around him, and because his world revolves around Selune, he believes all life must revolve around Selune as well. He is known to willfully ignore evidence that contradicts his worldview, cherry-picking facts that bolster his megalomania — though he does not view these tendencies as shortcomings.

## Devotion to Selune

Cirrus' devotion to Selune is unflappable. He believes he owes his entire life to the moon goddess, who interceded on his behalf to save him from enslavement to an evil Archfey. He will take whatever means necessary to spread Selune's influence across Faerûn and across the entire Cosmos.

## The Fane of Selune

Cirrus built and resides within the Fane of Selune, a massive twisting spire of white marble on the mainland shore of Lake Seluna. He can often be heard from its peak platform during the night, chanting prayers to Selune — chanting that audibly resembles yodeling and is objectively bad, often dissonant, off-key, and far too loud.

## Rivalry with Fëanon

Cirrus and Fëanon maintain a friendly rivalry rooted in their opposing philosophies. The heights of their respective towers are a constant point of competition — Cirrus' tower rivals Fëanon's in grandiosity but is not quite as tall, which is a mild source of irritation for Cirrus.
