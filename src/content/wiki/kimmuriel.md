Kimmuriel is a powerful Drow Psionicist who serves as a lieutenant to Jarlaxle within Bregan D'aerthe. His psionic teleportation abilities provide critical tactical advantages, including enabling the party and Lo'Dan to escape the collapsing celestial vault beneath Neverwinter's Chasm.

He later operates within Menzoberranzan's political structures, playing a key role in Bregan D'aerthe's complex dealings with the Drow noble houses.
