Athkatla is the capital city of the mercantile nation of Amn, and one of the wealthiest cities in all of Faerûn. Known as the City of Coin, Athkatla is a sprawling metropolis where gold is the ultimate measure of power and influence. The Council of Six rules from here, and the city's vast marketplaces, banking houses, and trading companies drive commerce across the continent. Magic use is heavily regulated by the Cowled Wizards, who enforce strict licensing on spellcasting within the city.

As the seat of Amnian power, Athkatla is the origin point for much of the political and military maneuvering that has affected the party's campaign, from the Amnian coup attempt in Silverymoon to the diplomatic delegations sent to Helm's Hold. The city's merchants and agents operate throughout the Sword Coast, making Amnian influence an ever-present factor in regional politics.
