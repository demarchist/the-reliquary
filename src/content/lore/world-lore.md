# World Lore

Imagine a fictional Cosmos that teems with a myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the planes of existence.

Within this Cosmos exists a plane of existence called the Material Plane.

Within the Material Plane exists a planet called Toril.

In the world of Toril, between the windswept Sea of Swords to the west and the mysterious lands of Kara-Tur to the east, lies the continent of Faerûn. A place of varied cultures and races, Faerûn is dominated by human lands, but interspersed among the lands of humans are old dwarven kingdoms and hidden elven enclaves, assimilated populations of gnomes and halflings, and more exotic folk.

Thunder Bluff is a notable geographic feature on the continent of Faerûn. It is a massive rocky prominence that towers over the surrounding region, giving it its name. Thunder Bluff is known for its sheer size and imposing presence. The region surrounding Thunder Bluff is also named after the rocky prominence, and it is a place of great beauty and natural wonder. Many different creatures and beings call Thunder Bluff and the surrounding region home, making it a vibrant and diverse part of Faerûn.

Thunder Bluff is situated on the shore of the mighty River Rauvin along the Trade Way between Neverwinter and Silverymoon overlooking a vast marsh called The Evermoors to the south.

The village of Kossenberg lies to the north of Thunder Bluff and farther beyond lies a magical forest called the Moonwood.

Thunder Bluff and the entire region for miles around lies within the political boundaries of an independent polity called "The Barony of Thunder Bluff."

The Barony of Thunder Bluff is governed by a council of powerful adventurers who call themselves the Faerûn Defense Force, but whom their detractors know as the Heralds of Woe. The members of the Faerûn Defense Force live within the Barony of Thunder Bluff. The members of the Faerûn Defense Force are: a male High Elf Wizard named Fëanon Sërindë, A male Tiefling Divine Soul Sorcerer named Cirrus Al Kayan, a male Human Paladin named Horatio Von Bumidere a.k.a Buumi, a male Halfling Monk named Tarkathee Daru a.k.a Tark, a female Drow Rogue named Aliyah Faen Tlabbar a.k.a Patches, a male Dwarf Gunslinger named Gundren Rockseeker, a male Svirfneblin Barbarian named Snorbul, a male half-elf Bard named Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews a.k.a. JmJm, and an Air Genasi Cleric named Thorna.

Fëanon is a High Elf male.  He has fine, symmetrical facial features. He is five feet and eleven inches tall and has a slender build that gives him an elegant and graceful appearance. His long, flowing hair is almost bluish-white in color, and frames his face beautifully. His wide-set green eyes are striking and captivating, and his copper-colored skin gives him a warm, exotic appearance. He has no facial hair, and his overall appearance is one of refinement and sophistication. Overall, Fëanon is a truly striking figure, commanding attention wherever he goes.

As a wizard, Fëanon has a deep understanding of the arcane arts and a strong belief in his own abilities. This leads him to view reliance on divine intervention as a form of intellectual dependency, a crutch that prevents people from achieving their full potential. Instead, Fëanon advocates for a more rational, secular approach to problem-solving, relying on one's own knowledge and skills rather than divine intervention.

Fëanon's belief in the power of the individual is a central part of his philosophy and outlook. He believes that people are capable of great things if they are willing to work hard and apply themselves, and that faith in the divine is a hindrance to achieving one's full potential. This belief is reflected in the way he teaches his students and acolytes, encouraging them to rely on their own abilities and knowledge rather than seeking guidance from the divine.

Fëanon's skepticism of divine intervention is a defining characteristic of his personality and beliefs. His followers see him as a forward-thinking and rational, someone who values knowledge and skill over faith and tradition. However, his beliefs are seen as controversial or even heretical by others who hold more traditional views.

Cirrus Al Kayan is an unusually tall and slender Tiefling male.  His teeth have been replaced with shiny, pointed metal dentures.  Cirrus is a devotee of the moon goddess Selune.  As a Divine Soul Sorcerer, Cirrus derives his magical power from his spiritual connection to Selune. Cirrus is the charismatic leader of The Cult of Selune.  Cirrus is a member of the Faerûn Defense Force.

Cirrus can charitably be described as a megalomaniac. His friends might describe him as self-absorbed or overly zealous. His enemies might describe him as an unhinged lunatic. He steadfastly adheres to a belief that the world revolves around him. Because his world revolves around Selune, it therefore follows that he believes all life must revolve around Selune. Cirrus is known to willfully or intentionally ignore evidence that contradicts his worldview, and will often cherry pick facts that serve to bolster his megalomania. Cirrus, however, is unaware of these shortcomings, or, rather, he does not view them as shortcomings at all.

Cirrus’ devotion to Selune is unflappable. He believes he owes his entire life to the moon goddess, who interceded on Cirrus’ behalf to save him from enslavement to an evil Archfey. Accordingly, he will take whatever means necessary to spread Selune’s influence across Faerun and across the entire Cosmos.

Cirrus and Fëanon are both powerful and respected members of the Faerûn Defense Force, but their different backgrounds and beliefs have led to a friendly rivalry between the two. Fëanon, as a High Elf Wizard, believes in the power of the individual and the value of rational, secular approaches to problem-solving. In contrast, Cirrus, as a Tiefling Divine Soul Sorcerer, derives his magical power from his spiritual connection to Selune and values faith and devotion to the divine.

While Cirrus and Fëanon are friends and allies, they often find themselves at odds over their differing philosophies. Fëanon sees reliance on divine intervention as a form of intellectual dependency, while Cirrus sees faith in the divine as a source of strength and guidance. They often engage in friendly debates and discussions over which approach is better, and their rivalry has even led to friendly competitions where they try to outdo each other with feats of magic and skill.

Despite their rivalry, however, Fëanon and Cirrus respect and value each other as fellow members of the Faerûn Defense Force. They recognize that their different approaches and beliefs can complement each other, and they work together to protect the Barony of Thunder Bluff and its people. Ultimately, their rivalry is driven by a mutual desire to better understand each other and the world around them, and it serves as a constant reminder of the value of diversity and the importance of respecting different perspectives.

Gundren Rockseeker is a male Mountain Dwarf Gunslinger, known for his hardy and compact frame. He stands just under four feet tall, and his thick, gray-brown skin is rough and bristly. Gundren has an enormous braided beard that hangs down below his waist, adding to his rugged and imposing appearance. Despite his gruff and no-nonsense demeanor, Gundren is a hardworking and determined individual who approaches life with a rough and tumble attitude. He is not afraid to use force and violence to solve problems, and he believes in working hard to earn what he has. Gundren is not known for his generosity, and he does not feel obligated to give handouts to others. He is a practical and straightforward individual, focused on achieving his own goals and advancing his own interests.

Gundren is a renowned marksman and a specialist with firearms of all kinds. In battle Gundren fights with an enormous magical cannon, lobbing exploding shells and grapeshot at the enemy.  However, as fearsome a fighter as Gundren is, he is perhaps even more renowned for his skills as an Artificer.  Gundren is always accompanied by Guinevere, an astoundingly sophisticated clockwork lion that he built himself.  Guinevere is absolutely loyal to Gundren and obeys his every command. Guinevere is Gundren’s magnum opus, his crowning achievement as an Artificer, and the envy of Artificers the world over. However, to others it can appear terrifying, with glowing, intelligent red-gem eyes staring out from a conglomeration of threshing blades, snicking gears, and armor plates.

Aliyah Faen Tlabbar is a drow woman trying to make her way on the surface world. As a child in the ruthless underdark societies of the dark elves, she learned harsh lessons about trust, deceit and survival. This upbringing instilled in her a near pathological sense of caution and suspicion - she is constantly watching the shadows for hidden threats, struggling to silence the paranoid whispers in her mind.

Despite having escaped to the relative safety of the surface world, Aliyah nurtures the trauma of her early life like a smoldering ember. She embraces fear, pain, loneliness and distrust as a motivational tool, believing that letting go of past suffering would only blunt her reflexes and jeopardize her survival. She romanticizes the vicious mentality that enabled her to survive among the dark elves.

As such, Aliyah keeps herself isolated and aloof, maintaining as much distance as she can manage even from companions she is beginning to trust. While she has formed a close bond with Fëanon and relies more on Snorbul than she would readily admit, she still holds back in an effort to retain her self-reliance and vigilance against betrayal.

In appearance, Aliyah is a small, slender woman with deep purple skin, silvery-white hair, sharp angular features and piercing almond-shaped eyes that glint like cut gems in shadowy environments. Her movements are stealthy and efficient - she seems to melt from gloom to gloom when she wishes to avoid attention. Yet she moves with lightning quickness when threatened. Her skin holds the scars of many hard-fought battles of the past, some fresher than others despite her enhanced healing abilities. She prefers dark, severely minimal clothing for ease of movement, but her weapons and other equipment are clearly of fine make.

Aliyah has many aliases.  She is also known as "Patches" or "Stitches."

Aliyah operates The Establishment inn and tavern in town both as a business venture and as a way to cement her network of connections amongst the shady underbelly of the region. Her maintenance of the neutral ground affords her insight and leverage with all manner of criminals, outcasts and more. She is not above threatening or applying pressure to these contacts when needed to get intelligence for her allies. For those she calls friends, she is unflinchingly loyal. But her stoic, suspicious bearing means she often stands back from the rest of the group even during moments of camaraderie. Though she keeps most others at a wary distance, Aliyah has an on-again, off-again romantic relationship with Horatio. Drawn to each other despite vastly different temperaments and alignments, they have danced around mutual attraction and affection for years without ever quite coming together. Aliyah's fierce independent streak, emotional walls and chaotic tendencies conflict with Horatio's lawful principles and steadfast dedication to his oath as a paladin. And while Horatio may be the only one capable of drawing Aliyah out of her shell, she fears losing herself in his strong convictions. No matter how much they care for one another, something always seems to pull them apart before long. Yet the spark refuses to fade. In quiet moments together, hidden glances reveal the wistful longing both still feel. When duty permits, they come together briefly to sate pent-up desire before the same differences send them spinning onto their separate paths once more. Someday they may finally find the confluence of timing and willingness to compromise needed to sustain something real. For now, the unconsummated longing colors their interactions, hovering unresolved like an unfinished song refrain.

Aliyah is the owner and proprietor of a bustling underworld commercial complex called "The Establishment."

The Establishment is located at a crossroads within the Barony of Thunder Bluff. The Establishment is a conglomeration of Inn, Brothel, and Casino.  It is a popular gathering place for members of the criminal underworld in the Barony of Thunder Bluff. It is a place where deals are made, secrets are traded, and alliances are formed. Aliyah is a savvy businesswoman, and she uses her knowledge of the underworld and her connections to keep The Establishment running smoothly. She is known for her strict code of conduct, and she does not tolerate violence or other illegal activities within the establishment's walls.

Despite its reputation as a hub of criminal activity, The Establishment is also a popular gathering place for members of the Faerûn Defense Force. Aliyah is a member of the group, and she often uses the establishment as a base of operations for their missions. The establishment's labyrinthine layout and subdued lighting make it an ideal place for the group to plan and prepare for their missions without being detected.

Despite its reputation as a den of iniquity, The Establishment also serves a valuable function within the Barony of Thunder Bluff. It provides a place for members of the criminal underworld to conduct their business without resorting to violence, and it helps to keep the streets of the barony safe.

In this fictional Cosmos, sorcerers are not wizards.

**Wizards and Their Towers**

In the arcane traditions of Faerûn, all wizards are compelled to build towers as a testament to their power and knowledge. These towers are not mere structures but reflections of a wizard’s philosophy, magical practice, and relationship with the world. They fall into two archetypes: **Up-wizards**, whose spires reach skyward to embrace visibility, and **Down-wizards**, whose complexes delve into the earth to court obscurity. This distinction, defined by a wizard’s desire to be seen or unseen, is orthogonal to good and evil, shaped by intent, magic, and societal context.

**Up-Wizards: Towers of Visibility**

Up-wizards construct their towers on high ground, such as hilltops or islands, with elegant spires and grand staircases that proclaim their presence. These structures are designed to inspire, intimidate, or influence, serving as beacons of the wizard’s identity.

**Philosophy and Motivation**: Up-wizards seek visibility, whether to share knowledge, assert dominance, or draw followers. Their towers are stages for their ideals, reflecting a desire to connect with or control the world around them.

**Magical Affinity**: Up-towers often align with celestial, weather, or divine magic, leveraging their height for stargazing or signaling. The open sky amplifies their spells and their presence.

**Cultural Perception**: In free societies like the Barony, Up-towers are celebrated as symbols of progress and enlightenment. In authoritarian lands, they signify loyalty or oppression, looming over the populace as reminders of power.

**Down-Wizards: Towers of Obscurity**

Down-wizards burrow their towers into the earth, creating hidden complexes in remote or secluded locations. These lairs prioritize secrecy, protection, or solitude, shielding their inhabitants from scrutiny or danger.

**Philosophy and Motivation**: Down-wizards embrace obscurity, either to safeguard their work, protect others, or conceal illicit deeds. Their towers are sanctuaries or fortresses, reflecting a preference for independence from external gaze.

**Magical Affinity**: Down-towers suit earth, necromantic, or alchemical magic, drawing power from the ground or hiding volatile experiments. Their seclusion enhances defensive wards and private study.

**Cultural Perception**: In the Barony, Down-towers spark curiosity or suspicion unless their purpose is clear, as with Snorbul’s Hole. In tyrannical lands, they often signal rebellion or hidden schemes.

**Orthogonality to Morality**

The choice between Up and Down is not a moral divide but a spectrum of visibility versus obscurity. Benevolent Up-wizards like Fëanon use visibility to inspire; malevolent ones use it to dominate. Benevolent Down-wizards seek obscurity to protect; malevolent ones to plot. A wizard’s tower reflects their personal intent—be it to shine as a beacon or lurk in shadow—shaped by their magic, philosophy, and the society they inhabit.

Within the Barony of Thunder Bluff there exists a lake named Lake Seluna.

In the middle of Lake Seluna, there exists a rocky and densely forested island named Sërindë Isle which is named in honor of Fëanon Sërindë. Sërindë Isle is a part of the Barony of Thunder Bluff. The only way to reach the island is by boat.

Fëanon built an enormous tower into the rocky prominence of Sërindë Isle. Fëanon resides within the tower. The tower's elegant spire reaches hundreds of feet into the sky. Fëanon built his tower as a magical fortress from which he can study and refine his craft and as a repository for his knowledge and wisdom. The tower is filled with powerful and dangerous artifacts that Fëanon has recovered during his many adventures, as well as a large collection of rare and valuable books and scrolls.

In addition to being a place of study and contemplation, Fëanon's tower has come to house a community of like-minded wizards, sorcerers, and other arcane practitioners that Fëanon’s has invited to live in the tower as his students and acolytes. Fëanon's community of students and acolytes is a diverse group, with members coming from many different backgrounds and cultures. Some are young and inexperienced, while others are older and more experienced. Some are dedicated scholars and researchers, while others are more focused on practical applications of magic. Despite their differences, they are all united by their shared love of magic and their desire to learn from Fëanon and from each other. Within the tower Fëanon provides them with a safe and supportive environment in which they can learn and grow. Fëanon is a strict but fair teacher, demanding excellence from his students but also rewarding their hard work and dedication. He is also a mentor, offering guidance and advice to those who seek it.

Overall, Fëanon's tower is a place of knowledge, power, and community, a hub of arcane activity where powerful wizards can gather to study, practice, and share their expertise. It is a place where powerful wizards can come to learn and grow, and where a belief in the power of the individual is central to the way of life.  At the same time, Fëanon's tower is also a place of great danger. The powerful artifacts and magical objects that Fëanon has collected over the years are a temptation for those who seek to use magic for their own gain. Fëanon must constantly be on guard against those who would seek to use his tower and its resources for their own ends, and he must be prepared to defend his home and his community from those who would do them harm.

Fëanon’s tower is eight hundred feet tall, predominantly round, and consists of fifty above-ground floors and a large relic chamber in the basement called the "reliquary” that contains rows and rows of arcane artifacts and ritual components that Fëanon uses in his magic. The tower's above-ground floors contain a mix of living quarters, libraries, laboratories, workshops, and other specialized rooms for the study and practice of magic. The tower was constructed from finely hewn and finished stone by skilled dwarven architects, engineers, and craftsmen.

The floors of Fëanon’s tower is filled with a variety of rooms, including libraries, laboratories, workshops, and living quarters for the wizard and his acolytes. The upper floors of the tower contain Fëanon's personal quarters and laboratory, where he conducts his most important and sensitive research. The lower floors are where the community of wizards and sorcerers live and work, and where they have access to the tower's many resources and facilities.

The base of Fëanon’s tower is surrounded by a Courtyard that tastefully incorporates the natural landscape of Sërindë Isle into its design. It includes gardens or other outdoor spaces that allow visitors to connect with the natural world, and its architecture is influenced by elven design and aesthetics.  At night, the courtyard is lit by floating magical lanterns. The courtyard is a place of great beauty, with elegant arches, graceful columns, and intricate carvings that are influenced by elven design and aesthetics. These architectural elements are intended to create a sense of harmony and balance, and to reflect the elven heritage of Fëanon.

The ground floor of Fëanon’s tower is entirely dedicated to a grand Entrance Hall. There are massive double doors leading from the Courtyard into the tower's grand Entrance Hall. The doors are each fifty feet tall and are dwarven-made from solid iron and trimmed with gold. The doors are adorned from top-to-bottom with a single relief engraving depicting a magical rune. The doors are crafted and hung with such precision that the seam between them is invisible and they appear as a monolithic metal slab.

The interior of the Entrance Hall is a circular space fifty feet high and features domed ceilings atop thirty foot tall interior walls.  The walls are covered in magical, larger-than-life, floor-to-ceiling relief sculpture depicting key events and accomplishments in Fëanon's life. They show him as a young wizard, studying under a master and learning the secrets of magic. There are scenes of him conducting powerful spells and rituals, as well as scenes of him battling against evil creatures and saving the lives of others. The sculptures are incredibly detailed and lifelike, with a sense of movement and energy that brings the scenes to life.

The floor of the Entrance Hall is constructed from seamless, polished dark gray marble that is veined with gold.

There is a reception desk within the Entrance Hall. The desk is the only piece of furniture within the entrance hall. The desk is positioned in the center of the Entrance Hall. The desk faces the entrance doors.  The desk is twenty feet wide, ten feet deep, and four feet tall.. The desk features an angular design and it is crafted from matte gray metal and richly grained wood. 

Behind the reception desk is a grand staircase that rises up several flights to a balcony jutting out from the tower walls and overlooking the Entrance Hall. The staircase is made from the same dark gray marble as the floor and it is adorned with intricately carved wood railings.  Across the balcony from the staircase, a set of six-foot-high plain metal elevator doors are built into the wall, providing the only means of accessing the upper floors of the tower.

The Entrance Hall is indirectly lit by enchanted strips of material inlaid into the walls and ceiling that glow with magical light and provide dramatic, yet warm and welcoming illumination.

Simple, roughly hewn gray granite benches are positioned evenly around the perimeter of the Entrance Hall interior. The Entrance hall is intended to be a place of awe and reverence, where visitors can feel the weight of Fëanon's achievements and the power of his magic while also learning about Fëanon's life and accomplishments, and be inspired to pursue their own paths in the arcane arts.

The circular shape of the tower and the domed ceiling in the Entrance Hall symbolize the unity and interconnectedness of the arcane arts.

Located on the 45th to 47th floors of Fëanon's tower, hidden from public view and accessible only to Fëanon and his most trusted apprentices, lie the highly confidential cloning and consciousness-transfer facilities. These facilities are dedicated to Fëanon's ambitious long-term project to achieve effective immortality and augment his already considerable power by distributing his consciousness across multiple clones of himself.

The cloning facility is a sterile, brightly-lit laboratory filled with advanced magical and alchemical equipment. Large, bubbling vats line the walls, each containing a clone of Fëanon in various stages of development. These clones are meticulously crafted to be perfect physical replicas of Fëanon, grown from his own cells and imbued with his genetic material through arcane rituals and carefully controlled alchemical processes.

Adjacent to the cloning lab is the consciousness-transfer chamber. This circular room is dominated by a complex array of runes and sigils carved into the floor, walls, and ceiling. At the center of the array stands a raised platform upon which sits a crystal throne, wired to a web of pulsing, glowing conduits. It is here that Fëanon will attempt to transfer his consciousness into one of his clones, a delicate and dangerous process that requires immense concentration and precise control over the arcane energies involved.

The apprentices assigned to this project are hand-picked by Fëanon for their exceptional intelligence, unwavering loyalty, and expertise in the relevant fields of arcane magic, alchemy, and metaphysical theory. They work tirelessly to refine the cloning process, research new techniques for consciousness transfer, and monitor the progress of the experiments. The work is often grueling and emotionally taxing, as the apprentices are acutely aware of the immense responsibility placed upon them and the potentially catastrophic consequences should anything go wrong.

Access to these facilities is tightly controlled, with multiple layers of magical wards and physical barriers in place to prevent unauthorized entry. The very existence of the project is a closely guarded secret, known only to Fëanon and his inner circle of apprentices. Fëanon is keenly aware that the public may react with fear and revulsion if they were to learn of his experiments, seeing them as a perversion of the natural order and a dangerous tampering with forces beyond mortal understanding. As such, he takes every precaution to ensure that knowledge of the project does not spread beyond the confines of his tower.

Despite the challenges and risks involved, Fëanon remains committed to his vision of achieving immortality and unlocking the full potential of his magical abilities. He believes that by succeeding in this endeavor, he will be able to dedicate himself fully to the pursuit of arcane knowledge and the exploration of the cosmos' greatest mysteries, unencumbered by the limitations of a mortal lifespan. The cloning and consciousness-transfer facilities within his tower represent the first steps in this grand and audacious plan, a testament to Fëanon's boundless ambition and unwavering determination in the face of even the most daunting of challenges.

Fëanon’s Laboratory is a place of great power and potential, where Fëanon conducts his most important and sensitive research.  The Laboratory takes up the entire 48th floor of Fëanon’s Tower.  It is a place of experimentation and discovery, where Fëanon tests new spells and theories, and where he pushes the boundaries of what is possible with magic. The Laboratory is filled with arcane instruments and powerful artifacts. It is a place where Fëanon unlocks the secrets of the arcane and the full potential of his magical abilities.

Fëanon's private chambers are located on the 49th floor of the tower. They are spacious and lavishly decorated, with intricate geometric patterns on the floors and walls.

The Observation Deck is a spacious and elegant room, located on the 50th floor of Fëanon’s Tower. It offers a stunning panoramic view of the surrounding landscape, with large windows that wrap around the entire perimeter of the room. The windows are made of a special, enchanted glass that is impervious to both physical and magical damage, allowing for a clear and unobstructed view of the outside world.

The Observation Deck is furnished with a number of comfortable velvet chairs and sofas, arranged in small conversation areas throughout the room. The chairs and sofas are positioned to take advantage of the view, allowing occupants to gaze out at the surrounding landscape as they relax.

The floor of the Observation Deck is made of panels of rich, dark wood, and is adorned with intricate designs and patterns that glow with a faint, magical light.

The Observation Deck is a peaceful and serene space, ideal for relaxation and contemplation. It is a favorite spot for Fëanon, who often comes here to unwind after a long day of study and practice.

The Observation Deck is accessed by a private elevator that only Fëanon and his most trusted acolytes have access to. This ensures that the Observation Deck remains a peaceful and secluded space, free from interruptions and distractions.

Fëanon's tower, while an architectural marvel, is also a masterpiece of arcane security. Instead of relying on traditional guards and physical barriers, Fëanon has woven a complex network of Antipathy and Sympathy enchantments throughout the structure. This intricate web of spells serves to subtly guide and control the movement of visitors, ensuring that each person only has access to the areas Fëanon deems appropriate.

Upon entering the tower, visitors are greeted by a receptionist who provides them with a color-coded badge. These badges are key to navigating the tower's enchantments. Each color corresponds to a specific level of access, granting the wearer permission to enter certain areas while restricting them from others.

As visitors move through the tower, they unknowingly interact with the Antipathy and Sympathy spells. These enchantments are keyed to the color-coded badges, invisibly guiding the flow of foot traffic. If a visitor attempts to enter an area for which they lack authorization, they will suddenly find themselves filled with an intense desire to be elsewhere. The Antipathy enchantment gently but firmly steers them away, causing them to unconsciously alter their course.

Conversely, the Sympathy enchantment draws authorized individuals towards their intended destinations. Visitors with the appropriate clearance will feel a subtle tug, an inexplicable sense that they are meant to be in a particular place. This guides them effortlessly to the areas they are permitted to access.

The result is a tower that appears to be entirely unsecured, with no visible guards or barriers. Visitors are often surprised by this apparent lack of security measures, given the importance and sensitivity of the work conducted within the tower's walls. However, this is precisely the illusion Fëanon seeks to maintain.

In reality, the tower's defenses are far more effective than any physical security could hope to be. The Antipathy and Sympathy enchantments work tirelessly, 24 hours a day, to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas. Unwelcome guests may find themselves wandering in circles, inexplicably guided back to the lobby or other public spaces, never quite able to put their finger on why they cannot reach their intended destination.

This system is one of Fëanon's most closely guarded secrets. Few, if any, beyond his inner circle are aware of the true nature of the tower's defenses. To the outside world, it appears as though the tower is simply an open, welcoming space. But to those who understand the true power of the arcane, it is a testament to Fëanon's mastery of the magical arts.

The color-coded badges and the enchantments they interact with form a silent, invisible security force, one that never tires and never wavers. It is a system that allows Fëanon to maintain tight control over his domain while presenting a facade of openness and accessibility. A masterwork of both magic and psychology, the tower's defenses are a reflection of Fëanon himself: subtle, brilliant, and always in control.

On the mainland shore of Lake Seluna, there is a massive tower called the Fane of Selune. The Fane of Selune was built by Cirrus and he resides there.The heights of their respective towers are a constant source of rivalry between Fëanon and Cirrus. Although Cirrus’ tower rivals Fëanon’s tower in both height and grandiosity, it is not quite as tall. This is a point of pride for Fëanon and a mild source of irritation for Cirrus.

The Fane is a twisting spire of white marble. There is a flat platform at the peak of the Fane that opens to the sky. Cirrus can often be heard from the platform during the night as he chants prayers to Selune. Cirrus’ chanting, which audibly resembles yodeling, is objectively bad, often dissonant or off-key. It is usually far too loud.

The Fane is an architectural marvel that encapsulates the combination of Cirrus’ love for himself and his love of Selune.

Outside the Fane are sprawling English-style gardens and well manicured hedges that create a series of labyrinthine passages. There is a motif of white and silver throughout the grounds, and symbols of Selune, most notably the crescent moon, are omnipresent. Through powerful divine magic, the Fane is shrouded in the perpetual umbra of a total solar eclipse that makes the tower and its grounds a surreal, otherworldly, and subtly unsettling place. How the gardens thrive is unexplained as it is never exposed to direct sunlight.

The interior of the Fane is dominated by a massive statue carved in the likeness of Cirrus. The statue extends up the core of the tower and houses a hidden elevator system that Cirrus uses to access his personal quarters and various hidden, private sanctums. A platform extending out from the “mouth” of the statue overlooks the pews and is used by Cirrus to deliver sermons to the Cult of Selune. Aside from the statue, much of the rest of the Fane’s interior is austere. The silvery moon motifs are the dominant aesthetic.

The basement of the Fane houses a magical sanctum known as the Den of Dreams, which is open to members of the public for a fee. The Den is dark and smoky, filled with pillars and pillows, hushed whispers and the occasional sound of quiet sobbing. People using the Den of Dreams can pay to be magically transported into the dreams of others. Many, however, choose to pay a lesser fee to be chemically transported into dreams of their own design through the use of hallucinogenic smoke.

The day-to-day operations of the Fane are primarily overseen by two were-rat siblings, Topsy and Turvy, who were among Cirrus' initial converts to the Cult of Selune. These siblings have cultivated profoundly differing perspectives on religious dogma. While one sibling adheres to more conventional religious ideals, the other has adopted a decidedly more radical stance, characterized by participation in self-mutilating religious rituals.

The Cult of Selune, which is headquartered at the Fane of Selune, is a small but devoted group of followers who are dedicated to the worship of Selune, the goddess of the moon. The cult is led by Cirrus, who is considered the high priest of Selune. The cult is known for its extravagant ceremonies and rituals, which often involve chanting, incense, and the consumption of hallucinogenic substances. The cult is also known for its emphasis on personal transformation and enlightenment, which it believes can be achieved through devotion to Selune and the cultivation of inner peace and understanding.

Despite its small size, the Cult of Selune has a significant influence on the Barony of Thunder Bluff, due in large part to Cirrus' charisma and the power of his magic. Many in the region turn to the cult for guidance and spiritual fulfillment, and the cult's rituals and ceremonies are often attended by large crowds. However, the cult is also shrouded in mystery and controversy, and it has attracted its share of skeptics and detractors, who view it as a dangerous and misguided group that is more interested in power and self-aggrandizement than in helping people.

Atop Thunder Bluff, stands a formidable fortress called The Keep of Thunder Bluff.  The Keep of Thunder Bluff was commissioned by the Faerûn Defense Force and built by skilled dwarven architects, engineers and laborers. Within its mighty walls stand the Temple of Helm and the Rockseeker Manufactory.

The Temple of Helm is a grand temple located within the walls of the Keep of Thunder Bluff, in the fantasy realm of Faerûn. It is dedicated to Helm, the god of guardians, protectors, and watchmen. The temple is a place of worship through service for those who follow Helm and his teachings.

The temple is a large, imposing structure, with high walls and a tall, domed roof. The interior of the temple is spacious and open, with columns supporting the ceiling and a large, central chapel. It is a plain and functional place designed to serve the needs of the vulnerable, poor, and needy in the community. The temple is run by a group of devout followers of Helm, who work tirelessly to provide aid and assistance to those in need.

The Temple of Helm is an important part of the community of Thunder Bluff, and it is well-respected by the local population. The temple serves as a beacon of hope and a place of refuge for those in need, and it is a place where people of all walks of life can come to find solace and support. The temple is open to all, and its doors are always open to those in need of help or guidance.

The Rockseeker Manufactory is a massive, sprawling complex located within the walls of the Keep of Thunder Bluff. It is a place of industry and innovation, where skilled craftsmen and engineers create some of the finest weapons and armor in all of Faerûn. The Manufactory is a hub of activity, with forges, foundries, and workshops filled with the sounds of hammering, grinding, and the roar of flames. The Rockseeker Manufactory was built by Gundren Rockseeker who maintains his residence there.  Gundren is the owner and foreman at the Rockseeker Manufactory and his extended family, who are renowned for their expertise in metalworking, run the Manufactory with precision and efficiency.  The air around the Manufactory is filled with thick black smoke, and the grounds are coated with a layer of coal ash. The walkways between buildings are lit with guttering oil lanterns. Wagons loaded with materials are constantly coming and going, carrying supplies to feed the forges and transport the manufactured goods. Despite the noise and chaos, the manufactory is well-organized and efficient, with a clear division of labor and a focus on productivity.

The Rockseeker family is always looking for new ways to expand their business and improve their products. They are constantly experimenting with new techniques and materials, and they are always on the lookout for new opportunities to grow their business.

The Rockseeker Manufactory is an important part of the economy of Thunder Bluff and a major employer in the region. The Rockseekers are respected members of the community, but are not known for their generosity nor their willingness to help others.

Buumi is a Human male. He is a tall, strong, and handsome man and, as such, is popular with ladies. He has a loud and boisterous demeanor.  He has piercing blue eyes, a bold shock of red hair, and sports an elaborate mustache. His many years of martial campaigning have left his arms strong, and his hands calloused.  

Buumi is well-educated and an eloquent speaker, despite his boisterous demeanor. He is a skilled diplomat and negotiator, and he often uses his charm and intelligence to persuade others to see his point of view.

As a Paladin, Buumi derives his power from the divine but he is not a devout follower of any particular god.  Rather, Buumi has sworn a powerful oath to come to the defense of those who call for it and aligns himself with whatever deity champions that calling.

Buumi is the scion of a noble family, but his parents died tragically some time ago.

Buumi is the captain of the City Guard, a position of great responsibility and prestige. He takes his duties seriously, and he is always on the lookout for threats to the city and its people. He is a respected and well-liked leader, and his men and women trust and follow him without question.

In his youth, Buumi was fascinated by stories of dragon knights and their powerful, sinuous mounts. He dreamed of one day becoming a dragon knight himself, so he too could ride such a beautiful creature.  However, as he grew older, he realized that his attraction to them was more than mere fascination. These feelings were not something that was widely accepted or even considered normal, so he tried to suppress them, but they continued to haunt him, and he struggled with feelings of shame and isolation.

Despite his secret, Buumi remains a strong and capable paladin, dedicated to upholding his oath and protecting the innocent. However, he still struggles with his feelings for dragons, and he is not sure if he will ever be able to fully come to terms with them.

Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews, commonly known as JmJm or simply Jack, is a Half-Elf Bard with a flair for the dramatic and a shadowed past that haunts him. Standing at five feet ten inches, Jack possesses thin, angular features accentuated by sharp cheekbones and a perpetually expressive face. His style is as bold as his personality, often sporting short, spiky hair dyed in a spectrum of vibrant colors. Known for his eccentric fashion choices, Jack is rarely seen without his colorful suits, dramatic costumes, and an array of unusual accessories—from flamboyant hats to flowing scarves and elaborate turbans.

On stage, Jack is a master of his craft—a charismatic performer whose dynamic and energetic presence captivates audiences across Faerûn. As a Bard, his talents in song, speech, and magic are unparalleled, allowing him to weave powerful enchantments into his performances. His travels have made him a well-known figure, earning him recognition under various names in far-flung corners of the land. Yet, despite the adoration and acclaim, Jack harbors a dark and terrible secret.

Before joining the Faerûn Defense Force, Jack was infamous under another name: The Dark Whistler, a ruthless assassin whose reputation was built on cold efficiency, brutal tactics, and the chilling whistle that accompanied each kill. The Dark Whistler persona was not just an alias but a manifestation of Jack’s trauma-induced dissociative disorder—a coping mechanism forged in the fires of relentless violence and death. In this state, Jack would mentally detach, his mind transforming the horrors around him into a surreal stage. Blood became ribbons, death scenes were choreographed like macabre dances, and the terror of his victims was drowned out by the imagined applause of a phantom audience.

This dissociation allowed The Dark Whistler to carry out his gruesome tasks with inhuman precision, devoid of guilt or remorse. To those who encountered him, he was more ghost than man, an eerie specter whose haunting melody heralded certain doom. But the weight of his deeds bore heavily on Jack, even as he tried to escape into his twisted mental sanctuary.

Jack’s transformation from The Dark Whistler to the man he is today began with a fateful encounter—a target's family that reminded him of his own past, forcing him to confront the true consequences of his actions. This moment shattered the illusion he had built around himself, sending him on a long journey of self-discovery and redemption. Abandoning the assassin’s path, Jack wandered aimlessly, seeking to atone for his sins and reclaim the humanity he had lost.

Despite his efforts to leave The Dark Whistler behind, Jack remains tormented by the duality of his existence. The persona lingers, a shadowy presence in his mind, a constant reminder of the violence that once defined him. Every day, Jack battles the fear that a single moment of weakness could bring The Dark Whistler back, plunging him once again into the abyss of his former self. This internal struggle shapes his every action, driving him to be a better person while keeping him ever vigilant, lest the monster within reclaims its stage.

Jack’s journey eventually led him to a tavern where he encountered the group that would become the Faerûn Defense Force. Presenting himself as an itinerant performer and adventurer, Jack joined their quest, seeing in it a chance for a fresh start and an opportunity to use his skills for good. Though he now fights for a noble cause, the specter of his past remains, and Jack is ever aware of the fine line he walks.

Jack is also the owner, operator, and star performer at the Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews Theater, or The JMJMT, an elaborate venue featuring a technologically advanced stage designed by Gundren Rockseeker. JmJm's performances are a spectacle of high energy, magical flair, and captivating artistry, drawing crowds from near and far.

To the world, Jack presents a flamboyant and often difficult personality, a colorful facade that conceals the deeper struggles and regrets that define him. His journey from ruthless assassin to celebrated performer and force for good is a testament to his complex character and his ongoing quest for redemption—a man forever dancing on the edge of light and darkness, determined to keep the shadows at bay.

Snorbul is a Svirfneblin male. He is four feet tall and has a peculiarly muscular, toned, and well-defined physique.  Snorbul’s skin has a stone-like texture and appearance and a dark blue tone. He is bald and beardless with no body hair.  Snorbul’s eyes are red. His ears are long and pointed. Snorbul tends to wear as little clothing as possible, and when he does he prefers tight-fitting net shirts and leather short shorts that showcase his muscles. As a Barbarian, Snorbul has a tempestuous temperament with a barely-restrained primal rage that always lurks right below the surface. This rage fuels not just his unrelenting battle frenzy but also the uncanny reflexes, resilience, and almost supernatural strength that makes him feared and respected throughout the land. To Snorbul, the trappings of civilization are a sign of weakness. Instead, Snorbul embraces extreme animalism in which keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage are prized. As a Svirfneblin, Snorbul is most comfortable when underground and in the dark where his acute senses and innate abilities make him an apex predator. Snorbul is known to be fiercely loyal to those he considers friends, but quick to exact revenge against those who have wronged him. Snorbul has a reputation for being unpredictable and volatile, and many people are afraid to cross him. Despite his rugged exterior and the tough reputation he carries, Snorbul harbors a deep compassion for individuals in vulnerable situations, particularly children and animals.

Snorbul is the owner, operator, and champion-in-residence of Snorbul’s Hole, a labyrinthine complex of underground tunnels and chambers located within the Barony of Thunder Bluff.  At surface-level Snorbul’s Hole is an unassuming, unadorned hole in the ground surrounded by piles of dirt and stones. Underground, however, Snorbul’s Hole is a bustling hive of activity centered around spectated martial competitions in which only the strongest remain standing.  Some matches follow rules that are strictly enforced by Snorbul and his associates; however, others are no-holds-barred cage matches to the death.  In either case, the denizens of Snorbul’s Hole are a famously rowdy crowd and gambling is encouraged.

Tarkathee Daru, known simply as Tark, is a male Halfling Monk and a respected member of the Faerûn Defense Force. Standing between three and four feet tall, Tark possesses a well-defined, muscled, athletic build that belies his small stature. He has a boyishly handsome face with perpetually tousled hair and tan, weather-worn skin that speaks to a life spent outdoors.

Tark's most striking feature is his warm, welcoming demeanor. He exudes an aura of calm and wisdom that draws others to him. His frank, honest, and unfailingly positive outlook on life is infectious, often helping to diffuse tense situations and bring out the best in those around him.

Despite his lack of formal education (he is illiterate and challenged by basic arithmetic), Tark possesses a profound worldly wisdom and an unerring moral compass. He has an extraordinary ability to see the potential for good in others, even when they can't see it in themselves. This empathy, combined with his patience and non-judgmental nature, makes him an excellent mediator and counselor.

As a Monk, Tark has mastered the art of harnessing ki, a magical energy that flows through living bodies. This mastery grants him extraordinary physical abilities, including uncanny speed and strength. Through the use of ki and years of mental discipline, Tark has learned to sustain his body such that he does not age physically, does not require food or water, and is immune to disease and poison.

Tark's fighting style is a graceful blend of acrobatics and powerful strikes, making him a formidable opponent despite his small size. However, he prefers to resolve conflicts peacefully whenever possible, using violence only as a last resort.

Tark lives alone in an elaborate treehouse deep in the forests of Thunder Bluff. His home is a whimsical structure cobbled together from repurposed materials, reflecting his creative and resourceful nature. The treehouse is a haven of tranquility, mirroring Tark's inner peace.

While Tark would prefer a secluded life of meditation and training, his strong sense of responsibility and compassion often draw him into the affairs of Thunder Bluff and its inhabitants. He frequently visits the town to offer his services in exchange for goods, and his wisdom and combat skills make him an invaluable asset to the Faerûn Defense Force.

Tark's philosophy centers around the belief that everyone deserves kindness and has the potential for growth and redemption. He sees challenges as opportunities for learning and personal development. His patience seems infinite, and he has a knack for helping others see the best in themselves.

Despite his generally cheerful demeanor, Tark carries the weight of past experiences. The scars visible on his body hint at a history of violence and hardship, yet these experiences have only served to deepen his compassion and reinforce his commitment to peaceful resolution.

Tark's role within the Faerûn Defense Force is often that of a moral compass and peacekeeper. His friends and colleagues respect his wisdom and often seek his counsel in difficult situations. While he can be a fierce warrior when necessary, Tark's true strength lies in his ability to see the humanity in everyone and his unwavering belief in the power of redemption.

Tark's treehouse is situated high up in a towering oak deep in the forests of Thunder Bluff. It is an elaborate structure, cobbled together from an assortment of boards, ropes, canvas, and other found items. The treehouse has multiple levels, including a main living space, kitchen, library, meditation room, and guest sleeping quarters. The base of the treehouse is anchored firmly to several thick branches sprouting from the massive oak trunk. A series of ladders and ropes provide access to the various levels and rooms.

The main living space is a hodgepodge of mismatched furniture and eclectic decor, with items gathered from Tark's many adventures. Brightly colored tapestries hang on the walls alongside exotic masks and weapons. Piles of pillows serve as seating and there are several hammocks strung up for sleeping. The kitchen consists of a stone hearth and makeshift counters and shelves stocked with food from the forest.

A small library area houses shelves crammed with scrolls and books, some neatly ordered while others are strewn haphazardly about. Tark's meditation room is the highest room in the treehouse, with windows open to the forest on all sides. Cushions and incense burners create a relaxed atmosphere suited to Tark's daily meditation. Outside the meditation room is a small garden where Tark grows herbs and vegetables.

Rope bridges connect the various sections of the treehouse. The somewhat precarious construction echoes Tark's carefree, wandering lifestyle. Though disorganized and messy at times, the treehouse radiates charm and reflects the joy Tark takes in his simple life in the forests of Thunder Bluff.

Ella is a highly skilled Harper agent in her late twenties, with a lithe, athletic build honed by years of rigorous training. Her sharp, observant eyes are a deep green, often hidden behind carefully crafted expressions that rarely betray her true thoughts. Her hair, a rich auburn, is usually kept in a practical braid or bun, allowing her to blend in or stand out as her missions require. Raised and trained by the Harpers from a young age, Ella possesses a diverse skill set that makes her a formidable operative. She's proficient in various forms of combat, espionage, and subterfuge, with a particular talent for adapting quickly to new environments and roles. Her time in the theater adds another layer to her abilities, as she becomes adept at the technical aspects of stagecraft. Ella's personality is complex and evolving throughout the story. Initially, she presents as coolly professional, focused, and detached – a perfect agent capable of compartmentalizing her emotions to get the job done. However, beneath this exterior lies a woman grappling with doubts about her purpose and the morality of her actions. As the story progresses, Ella's rigid worldview begins to crack. Her experiences at the theater, the unexpected connection with JmJm, and her time with Tark all contribute to a profound internal conflict. She struggles with questions of loyalty, redemption, and personal identity. Her natural curiosity and intelligence, once primarily tools for her missions, become the means by which she critically examines her own beliefs and actions. Ella has a dry, sometimes dark sense of humor that occasionally surfaces, especially in tense situations. She's introspective and observant, with a keen eye for detail that serves her well both in her covert activities and in her journey of self-discovery. Despite her training to avoid attachments, Ella finds herself forming meaningful connections with several characters, most notably Tark and, indirectly, JmJm. These relationships challenge her ingrained isolation and push her towards personal growth. As she grapples with the consequences of her actions and the possibility of redemption, Ella displays a growing courage that goes beyond physical bravery. She shows the courage to confront her own flaws, to admit when she's wrong, and to actively choose a different path. By the end of her journey, Ella emerges as a complex, multifaceted character – still skilled and intelligent, but now with a deeper understanding of herself and the world around her. Her experiences have transformed her from a weapon wielded by others into a woman forging her own path, carrying the weight of her past actions while striving towards a more ethically grounded future.
