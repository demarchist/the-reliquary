## Camp in the Desert

After putting distance between themselves and the bandit massacre, the group pulled the wagon to a stop for the night. Patches strung a tripwire perimeter while Fëanon camped on the wagon bed, combing through treasure, identifying items, and transcribing spells. Buumi and Cercei talked for a while before Tark came over, full of questions — could she fly? Tentatively, the girl said yes, but not in human form. To put her at ease, Tark activated his staff's flight and flitted around the camp. Cercei transformed into her hatchling shape — a small dragon the size of a hunting dog — and flew after him. Buumi smiled, then the smile faded as he realised his daughter's nature would change as she outlived her shorter-lived friends and family.

Patches showed Gundren the revolver she had taken from Castle Ravenloft. The dwarf and his brothers crowded around in astonishment. Patches set old bottles on a log and shot them with cracks of thunder. The whole camp stared. She returned to the fire smiling.

Buumi stuffed Cercei's pillow with coins — thinking a dragon would appreciate such things — and draped the ornate fur cloak around the little girl. At dinner, both Tark and Cercei ate ravenously. Buumi rushed over to instruct his daughter in table manners, pointing to Fëanon's perfect etiquette as the elf picked at his food.

## The Thunderstorm and the Vulture

The next morning, a downpour soaked the camp. Ahead lay the localised thunderstorm surrounding the ruins of Ascore on the desert's edge. Tark wanted to go straight through. Fëanon stopped the group — a lair like that would be full of dangers. They skirted it instead, adding hours to the trip. Looking across the rocky plains, they saw dust devils, sandy sinkholes, and the shimmering carapace of a huge beetle. Giant vultures circled above.

Food rations were becoming an issue. The group devised a plan to lure one down. Buumi hurled a pork chop — Cyrrus caught it with mage hand, admonishing the waste. As a vulture circled low, Patches loosed a crossbow bolt. Tark cast darkness on the bolt mid-flight, creating an inky sphere that slammed into the bird. He shadowstepped inside, broke the vulture's neck with an elbow drop, and rode the dead creature to the ground. The dwarves butchered it efficiently and Fëanon seared the meat for storage.

## Tark's Dream

That evening, the group camped at the forest's edge. Gundren donned the bejewelled helmet from Strahd's treasury, the ornate breastplate, and Rahadin's cloak of silken strips, strutting around better equipped than a Dwarven king. Meanwhile, a dust mephit tripped one of Patches' tripwires and fluttered to the wagon. Cercei shifted to dragon form, crouched like a hunting cat, and pounced — but the creature escaped. Fëanon snapped his fingers and put it to sleep, scooping it up for examination while Cercei leaned down from the wagon to watch.

Around the campfire, the group shared vulture meat and whiskey from Buumi's flask — and mayonnaise from Cyrrus's newly identified alchemy jug. Cercei turned out to like mayo as much as Cyrrus. Taking a break from consuming two gallons of the stuff, Cyrrus asked Tark about his old master. After a few minutes, he learned Tark had no idea if Gabbock was alive or dead. Cyrrus offered to find out.

Through the dream spell, Tark found himself in an expanse of darkness. A lone figure huddled before him — all skin and bone, wispy white hair, milky blind eyes. Gabbock was a shadow of his former self. He thought it was a trick until Tark performed a stunning strike exactly as he had been taught. Recognising the truth, Gabbock broke down, telling Tark of his enslavement in their homeland at the hands of the great lich Zhengyi.

Tark returned to reality and walked out of camp without a word. Buumi made to follow, but the moment Tark left the firelight he shadowstepped to the forest. He spent the night attacking trees and smashing branches to work through his feelings.

## The Valley and the Gnoll

Snow drifted down as they entered the Nether Valley. Tark drew shadow around the group to hide their tracks at the fork. They travelled a score of miles without incident. That evening, Cyrrus challenged the despondent monk to a sparring match — the only thing that would cheer him up. Patches perched on a boulder for a view as the dwarves started a betting pool. The fight moved into a boulder field, Cyrrus slinging force blasts while Tark dodged and leapt.

Patches spotted movement behind them. She loaded her crossbow and sent a bolt past the combatants into the chest of an approaching monster — a nine-foot humanoid canine monstrosity, a demon gnoll. Its red eyes went wide as it slashed at Tark and found the monk deflecting everything. The whole group opened fire. In heartbeats, the gnoll was reduced to a charred set of legs. Cyrrus and Tark called their match a draw.

The next night, Patches heard clumsy bandits approaching in the dark. She caught Fëanon's attention and mouthed "bandits." The elf donned his mask. All four bandits froze, eyes going wide, then turned and fled into the darkness. The group chuckled and wondered what he had said. Fëanon returned to his books without answering.

## The Bridge

Climbing out of the valley, they heard a three-note blast from a horn. Barthen leapt to his feet on the wagon — a Dwarven patrol horn. Their kin were in trouble. Buumi put Cercei on the wagon and the group galloped toward the sound.

The river Rauvin roared below a squat stone bridge. Twelve dwarves held a line against a horde of goblinoids — dozens of orcs, goblins, ogres, and two hill giants. As the front orcs smashed into the dwarves and laid three flat, Fëanon unleashed a blistering fireball along one flank, incapacitating a swathe. Cyrrus raised a wall of force between the dwarves and their attackers. Tark shadowstepped into the shadow of a hill giant and began smashing its knees. Patches hurled a firebomb into Gundren's patch of grease, igniting the rear rank of goblins. Buumi charged the second giant as it reeled from Gundren's shells, and Cyrrus immolated it. Fëanon's second fireball washed across the wall of force, reducing half the remaining attackers to ash. The ogres and surviving giant heard a voice in their heads telling them to flee or die — and being not very smart, they fled.

Patches cleaved through the remaining goblins. Buumi thunderstepped to the dwarves and finished the stragglers. The patrol stared in awe. Buumi revived the two dead dwarves while Cyrrus healed the wounded. Gundren began talking with the patrol commander — Gebbin Steeltoe — who was still in shock over the saviors that had appeared at their time of need.
