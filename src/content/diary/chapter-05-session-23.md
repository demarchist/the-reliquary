## Opening Salvo

The castle vibrated. Dust fell. The teleportation spell was minutes from execution. Mordenkainen slammed Stick onto a step as he descended, azure light cascading outward — Tark's vision flickered with echoes of the near future.

He saw Patches crouched behind furniture, hiding from the red dragon. The future showed her beckoning him with Ireena and the journals. As she began to call out in the present, Tark was already moving — pulling Ireena along, grabbing the books from Fëanon's pack. He arrived at Patches just as she opened her mouth and cut herself off in surprise. Patches laid out the plan: Ireena would ride in Tark's bag of holding while Patches quaffed an invisibility potion and got the evidence to Strahd. The group agreed. Ireena took a deep breath and jumped into the bag. Patches vanished and sprinted for the chapel's copper doors.

Gundren loaded a special shell, took aim at the red dragon, and adjusted at the last instant — hitting it squarely in the eye. The beast staggered, molten lava dribbling from its snout. Fëanon summoned a massive disembodied tentacle in Rahadin's path. The Dusk Elf leapt and somersaulted over it, drawing his bejewelled scimitar — greenish poison glistening on the blade. He slashed the construct and hurled two daggers, hitting Urwen in the gut through a seam in his armour and catching Waldo in the neck.

Buumi blessed himself, Fëanon, and JmJm. The bard flourished his cutlass and cast greater invisibility on Tark, who vanished. Cyrrus paralysed the red dragon with a comet of crackling energy. Invisible, Tark leapt onto its head. No one could see the monk's strikes, but they heard the resounding cracks as Bahamut's staff shattered scales and split a horn. Tark landed, drank a potion of growth, and the animated bookcase waddled past the now-giant invisible monk to crush the stunned dragon beneath its shelves. Gwen followed with a flurry of magic missiles from her tail.

## The Darkness

Rahadin dropped a globe of darkness over himself an instant before the tentacle tried to wrap him again. Inside, the construct briefly restrained him before he misty-stepped free. He reappeared at the edge of the darkness and struck at Ezmerelda — hitting only a mirror image. He hurled two knives: one into Waldo's throat, another into Urwen's gut. Urwen dispelled the darkness with a cutting gesture and a tired smile. Arrows rained from the wereraven archers on the staircase.

The red dragon broke free of the paralysis and breathed fire. The bookcase took the brunt and was reduced to cinders in moments. The dragon leapt clear — and the second statue shattered, a young white dragon striding forth with frost streaming from its jaws. JmJm beheld the majestic creature with awe and a little terror, then turned to the battered red dragon and launched a psychic assault of charged profanities. The insults tore into its mind. The young red dragon sank to the ground, a single tear streaming from a dimming eye as it breathed its last.

## Wachter and the White

The white dragon breathed freezing air over Ezmerelda, Waldo, and Urwen. Waldo fell behind a ceremonial shield that saved his life. Urwen barely survived, healing warmth from a prayer to Lathander pulling him back from the brink. Buumi smashed Ashbringer down on a skeleton attacking JmJm and it detonated in sunlight, burning the others away. Lady Wachter's hand construct struck at Buumi — he blocked with the crystal greatsword in a shriek of clashing magic.

At the castle entrance, a zombie ogre stumbled in. Gwen pounced, tearing it apart. On the stairs, soulless villagers tumbled down in an eerily silent wave, the tripwires and greased steps causing a mass of falling bodies. More kept coming.

Lady Wachter marched through the front doors with her skeleton warriors, silhouetted against the energy-filled sky. Across the hall, Mordenkainen yelled to the invisible Patches to avoid the warded chapel door. Patches curtly told him to stop shouting her name near Rahadin. The archmage poured a sustained witch bolt into the copper doors. Patches tossed a ruby from her earring — it transformed into a firefly and detonated in a fireball against the glowing metal.

Fëanon pointed at the castle's main doors and a streak of fire tore through the approaching skeletons, his fireball reducing them to ash and reddening Lady Wachter's skin. She screamed in rage and sent another wave of skeletons along with a cloudkill that enveloped JmJm.

The bard stumbled backward out of the gas, coughing, saw the white dragon facing away, and attacked — drawing bloody lines in its flank as his inkblade created a cloud of obscuring ash. Tark shadowstepped in, cracking scales. Buumi drank a potion of growth, grabbed one of the dragon's horns with his remaining hand, and twisted its head painfully to the side. Cyrrus's owl swooped down from the staircase and was polymorphed mid-flight into a Tyrannosaurus Rex that cracked the marble floor on impact and bit at the restrained dragon. Gwen leapt at its hind legs. Fëanon hurled fire. Surrounded and frenzied, the white dragon threw Buumi off and fled into a side hallway, hovering to catch its breath.

The T-Rex leapt at Rahadin and tried to snatch him up. The Dusk Elf danced aside, slashed its jaw, and misty-stepped away. Recognising the spell's weakness, he hurled a dagger at Cyrrus — the hit broke concentration and the T-Rex reverted to an owl in a tumble of limbs. A second dagger killed the owl in a puff of feathers.

## The Chapel Doors

Patches grew impatient. She lined up a heavy crossbow bolt at the warping hinges of the chapel door and waited. The hinge shattered in a spray of molten shards and the door collapsed. Mordenkainen and Patches rushed through into a long hallway lined with suits of armour — and found a second set of identical copper doors at the far end, already glowing hot from the chapel's energy. Patches sagged. Mordenkainen nodded and launched another witch bolt.

Lady Wachter summoned a Bigby construct of her own. The skeletal warriors closed on JmJm, who parried masterfully. Buumi, still gigantic, unsheathed Ashbringer and slammed it down on a skeleton — the sunburst burned the others away. Gwen pounced on a zombie ogre and began shredding it.

On the stairs, Cyrrus froze the front ranks of soulless with howling cold from his staff. Gundren lobbed alchemist's fire into the grease-coated crowd behind them. Across the hall, Tark shadowstepped above the hovering white dragon and knocked it from the air. Vampires rushed from a nearby tower and one grappled the invisible monk, biting into his neck. Tark shadowstepped free and chased the fleeing dragon, landing on its head and killing it with a final staff blow, riding the corpse to the ground.

Cirrus dispelled Lady Wachter's hand construct in a wave of chaotic energy. The necromancer began frothing at the mouth, screaming as every spell failed and her minions crumbled.

## The Dragon Revealed

Rahadin, blinded and burned by Ashbringer's sunburst, staggered under arrows from the wereraven archers. Kurt and Derik rushed in. "I will not be slain here!" Rahadin yelled. The brothers repeated his words mockingly as they jammed pistols against his back and chest and fired. The musket balls ripped through the elf. His cry of anguish transformed into a roar that shook the castle.

A vortex of shadow erupted. Within it, something massive moved — silver wings, a tail. Half of Derik flew from the vortex, viscera trailing. Kurt stumbled out the other side, lacerated and partially crushed. The shadow dissipated, revealing an adult silver dragon — Rahadin — with dark energy and orange lightning cascading around him in a nimbus of power. Kurt looked up and repeated, in a much smaller voice: "I will not be slain here..."

The group stared at the beast. Buumi backed away, legs weak. Others trembled. With a mighty roar, Rahadin the Corrupted turned his chrome eyes on the mortals who dared challenge him.
