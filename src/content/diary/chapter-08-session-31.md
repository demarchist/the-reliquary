The battle against the demons and the rioting Derro rages.

Ront lashes out at Fey'Anon, but the tentacles merely smash through one of the mirror images.

Fey retaliates with a powerful Firebolt, but the fire glances off the demonic hide of the disfigured warlock.

Patches continues to snipe from her perch, hitting Ront with bolt after heavy bolt.

Cirrus remains entombed in ice to avoid melee with Ront, but notes two of the Derro rush in to flank, one smashing away (in futile) against the ice.

Gundren takes a read of the scene, gauging the Narzugon's efforts to hold the bridge, the Stoneguard and the strange blood rain toward Ront.

Gundren calls out, thinking that killing Ront might trigger something very bad...

Another heavy bolt slams into the disfigured Orc .

Patches decides that Fey would probably know better than Gundren, and he hasn't called out anything but curses so far.

The party proceeds to rip into Ront.

The Disfigured Orc desperately attempts to cast Fey'Anon into the Abyss via a Planeshift.

Luckily, one of the Mirror image illusions is touched, rather than the real Elf and the powerful spell has no effect.

Fey strikes back with a Fire Bolt.

Buumi, Cirrus and Gundren kill the flanking Derro Veterans, taking away Ront's advantage.

Surrounded by Fey, Snorbul, Buumi and now Cirrus, Ront is hard pressed to stand his ground.

Across the bridge, another front of the Derro Riots surges forward.

In anticipation The Narzugon Anduriel shoots the cart with a firebolt, melting through the cabin door and into the explosives inside.

The cart detonates just as it rolls into the front line of the Derro.

Immediately after, Anduriel swings her axe down twice, creating a funnel of Ice-walls across the bridge.

Seeing her tactic, Gundren thinks he can one-up her and throws another ruby from his helm, creating a wall of fire, cutting the Derro off from advancing.

Meanwhile, the Stoneguard work and take down one of the Glabrezu, though lose another Guard in the process as they hold that entire side of the plaza.

Tark finishes up with the Derro he faces and turns to assault Ront with the rest of the group, as he looks on though, something happens.

covered in blood from the raining droplets, Ront curls the malformed tendrils of his own arm around himself.  As the tusks of the tentacles bite into his own flesh and tear, Ront is ripped apart and flayed flesh is scattered across the whole area.

As the body is destroyed, a larger, more sinister form unfolds from the carnage, growing upon itself into a massive behemoth of muscle, scale and fur.

A two headed monstrosity wails as it stands to its feet, more than 30ft tall.

Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons has been summoned by the blood ritual (wainting since Sludabloop! JEEZ!).

Tark wastes no time and immediately shadowsteps above the demon prince and begins to pummel him.

Landing a wicked blow, one of the heads winces and calls out.  It knows of Tark, it's looking for him in fact, as it knows the monk normally carries "**It" **referring to the artifact.

understanding the Abyssal words, Tark shudders, but begins to come up with a plan.

The others recover from their panic from seeing the massive demon quickly and rally, taking the fight to the prince of Demons.

The hulking demon lashes out at Tark and Buumi, massive ribbons of toothy flesh tearing into them and wounding them terribly.

Worse though, a necrotic phage seems to remain, reducing the health and vigor of anyone touched by the Prince of Demons.

Seeing the very life sapped from them, Cirrus heals Tark as Buumi enacts an Aura of Vitality to bolster everyone.

Attack after attack slams into Demogorgon as it tries to make sense of the new space and the battlefield.

It takes only seconds before it orients and begins to level it's beguiling stare upon the party.

Tark is staggered as he meets the gaze and is then lashed terribly.

Fey steps from behind a portion of rubble and a massive shockwave emanates, the Thunderwave ripping up Demogorgon's back and it staggers.

Tark gets to his feet and pretends, with a minor illusion, to pull the artifact from his pouch and then shadowstep to the center of the bridge to try and lure Demogorgon away from his friends.

The Demon obliges, staring directly into the eyes of one of the paralyzed Duergar guards on the bridge, Demogorgon uses his mind as a window and steps out onto the bridge, beneath Tark.

The Prince proceeds to rip the Duergar apart, even stealing the soul of one into a Soul Cage to consume later.

Shocked by the appearance of the Demon, the Narzugon quickly composes herself and summons her Nightmare Steed.

Fiery Lance in hand, she makes a pass as the Demon, striking it wickedly, but she underestimates his reach and is punished severely for the attack.

gravely wounded, the Narzugon gallops on, sinking low in the saddle.

As Demogorgon takes strike after strike from the powerful group - Snorbul having spent the entire time climbing him, axe strike by axe strike - the wounds begin to mount and Demogorgon begins to look around, planning his exit.

Realizing it's time to leave, Demogorgon is caught off guard as Cirrus yells out that HE has the artifact, not Tark, and then places down a bag of holding.

The Prince of Demons knows that Tarks was an illusion, and Cirrus is so resolute in his words, that the Demon Lord believes him and crashes his way, smashing through the city toward him in a frenzy.

Snorbul strikes, cutting deep into the Demon's legs, Gundren blasts shot after shot.

Blasting away with his cantrips (saving his spell slots) Fey feels something that catches his attention.

Turning toward the Narzugon, he watches as she consumes the ambient magic around her, healing her own wounds and reducing the wild magic in the area.

Fey knows that these Narzugon have healing abilities, but this was different that what he witnessed before...

Buumi swoops down as the Demon Lord charges and smashes him across one snout with Foehammer, sending teeth flying.

As he staggers, Patches leaps from a balcony after having levitated and leaped across the width of the bridge.

She lands on his back and rushes up toward the heads.

Finding where the two spines fuse, she plunges Eclipse into the Demons flesh...
