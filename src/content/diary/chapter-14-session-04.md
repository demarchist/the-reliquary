JmJm charges in atop Steden, and gets about 10ft before the rest of the party all shout at him to stop and come back.

They need to think this through!

JmJm reluctantly agrees and hops off Steden and returns to the group

Horsing around; the Nightmare sheepishly turns back and begins to inch toward the Wyvern, hoping to start something

Patches looks him right in the eye and tells him to knock it off and get back to the group

Steden mutters something under his breath and trots back over, head low

The group decides to scout these creatures first and Patches moves in for a better look

With the dappled lighting from the dense canopy of vines above, the setting sun casts long shadows in the sheltered vale, Patches easily blends in with her Piwafwi

She moves past the Wyvern undetected, though it shifts and sniffs the air slightly

Patches circles in to investigate the titanic Cyclops

The thing is easily the largest giant they have seen, and though its clothes, armor and weapons are all made of hide and bone, the workmanship is excellent, with tanned and stitched hide and carven bone

The work is large and exquisite and not intricately made by small hands

So the thing has culture and a good working of tools - evidence by it’s flail of many Wyvern tail stingers

She creeps closer still and the Cyclops shifts and tilts its head, closing its great eye and seeming to listen.

Patches freezes but flinches as the Cyclops simply pushes its fingers down into the nearby rock

With many years of experience in the Underdark, she suspects Termorsense

With renewed stealth, she backs away, undetected by the titan

She returns to the group and recounts what she saw.

Cirrus hears that this giant is clearly cultured and decides to try his best to just talk with him

He enacts a flying spell, and gives the Wyvern a wide berth and approaches the Cyclops

The Cyclops, clearly seeing the flying Warlock, simply sits back and waits but watches intently

Cirrus attempts several languages, getting little response until he tries Draconic - at which point the massive Cyclops frowns in disgust

Cirrus quickly stops and tries a different language, trying the lase in his repertoire - Netherese

The unibrow of the behemoth rises in surprise and responds in the ancient language of the lost Shadow Empire.

His name is Borborygmos and he has lived in this desert since time immemorial

Cirrus employs the titan to allow them to harvest the Wyvern bone here as it is for a good cause - battling Orcus - which Cirrus asks if Borborygmos could assist with

The titan implies that he has fought gods before and it has “never gone well” and is not inclined to do it again

Cirrus does impress the behemoth enough that the giant proclaims that he will not stop them from assaulting the Wyvern - he was here waiting for its death anyways.

Once it is dead though, only the strong will prevail with the materials of its corpse

Cirrus understands that Borborygmos wont attack them while they kill the Wyvern, but he is also here for its corpse, so they will contend with him afterwards…

Cirrus thanks the Bone Hunter and flies back to the group, carelessly getting close enough to the Wyvern that it spits a cone of poison at him, burning his already blind eyes

He makes it back to the group and conveys that he thinks they have free range on the Wyvern, but must plan for a hasty exit with their prize.

The group agrees and they prepare their assault on the great draconic beast

Borborygmos watches with interest

Feanon preps a teleporation circle

Patches rigs the Vine-covered roof with a Satchel charge and then reclaims her second bomb from Machmoud, the Bedoin tag-along they saved from the Bobbit worms

The Drow then sneaks to the Wyvern and with a dismantled Tar Bomb, sticks the Satchel Charge to the Wyvern’s leg and begins to sprint away, just as the group attacks to distract the Ancient creature

Seeing challengers and prey, the Wyvern goes into a frenzy, slashing with claw, biting and seizing with its jaws and stabbing with it’s powerful poison stinger

The group takes many brutal hits, but retaliate in kind

Patches bomb goes off

The blast shakes then cavern and the creature cries in pain and leaps into the sky flapping its wings, just as the second bomb goes off on the ceiling

Cirrus polymorphs a nearby boulder into a young Silver Dragon which lunges at the Wyvern just as the flaming debris of the canopy comes down on its flapping wings

It is pummeled to the ground where it is slain moments later

Patches rushes in to sever the remaining tendons of its leg and the group rallies around the corpse

Borborygmos claps his hands and stands to attack

The group rushes back to Feanon’s prepared teleportation circle while Buumi and Patches drag the severed Wyvern leg

The Polymorphed Silver Dragon attempts to take off with the corpse of the Wyvern as a distraction and Borborygmos shouts in dismay

The titan raises his hands and one foot, roaring and then smashes them to the ground

A Tidal wave of stone and sand rushes toward the group and they teleport away just in time

Back in the barony the group finds themselves atop Feanon’s tower, safe

Machmoud falls to his knees, sobbing in terror

He gets the standard “abduction” spiel from the group and is ushered off to a support group for new “citizens”

Buumi does mention to the man that a Trader from the Anauroch tribes comes once a month, he can wait for him in town if he wishes

Machmoud thanks Buumi and heads out of the Tower, to the Paladins of Helm.

Cirrus sends a messenger back to Borborygmos with a gift and a letter

The sun sinks below the horizon and the group begins to scatter to enjoy their evenings.

Gundren heads directly to the manufactory to get the Wyvern material preserved and ready to be worked with.

The more Gundren thinks about the preparation, the more he wants to ensure that he gets this right.  Surprisingly nervous, Gundren turns his mind to the planes and wonders where he may seek such material knowledge

Patches meditates in her sanctum and prays to Elistraee

She seeks an edge against her house - she seeks knowledge of their ancestry, family name and the Jun Sahara of Alaskar - uncursed Drow

She is told to go to Svartalfheim and is given a name: **Yggward**

Patches heads to the Fane and asks Cirrus for something that cannot wait - She needs to go to Svartalfheim

Cirrus agrees, he too has questions that seemingly can only be answered there. 

His body is deteriorating slowly.  

He has been told to go to “The Towers of Twilight” if he seeks to survive

They head to Patches Establishment to tell the others of the upcoming Cirruscation

While they wait for the others to arrive, Patches notes Lady Aldencroft and Buumi walking down the scnonce-lit high-street, enjoying the early summer evening.

She has Mr. Pickles move Stone 343b in an attempt to trip the woman

She stumbles into Buumi, who blushes and catches her

The cobblestone shifts back into place, no one the wiser

Patches glares

Buumi takes his leave of Lady Aldrencroft and enters the Establishment and joins his friends

Meanwhile Tark walks to Shadowmoon village, to visit the Orcs

He has a bad feeling in the back of his mind and asks the Orcs if anything out of the ordinary has happened

He is told of a Goblin batrider raid the night before, though they were slaughtered

The Brave points to some nearby drying racks and large bat-wings and non-descript jerky can be seen drying

Tark mentions his bad feeling and the Orc finds it puzzling, he has heard of one other having a “bad feeling”

Bolg, The Mountain Giant

The huge man sits not 60ft away by a huge bonfire, sharpening a gargantuan Gladius sword of exquisite make, his massive scale hauberk gleaming in the firelight

Tark approaches and remarks at the beauty of the weapon

Bolg tells him it's a custom order from the Rockseekers.  It’s a beauty

Tark asks about the Goblin raid and Bolg remarks that two dozen flew in from the south, shooting bows and dropping alchemists fire on the Orcs

The orcs quickly and expertly shot the attackers from the sky and Bolg cleaned up any riders that made it to the ground

There were no survivors, though he heard there was a prisoner up in town from laird Rockseeker the day before

Tark mentions he has a bad feeling and Bolg perks up

He says that he has been sleeping ill and last night, just before the raid woke him, he was dreaming of a Storm-giant being flayed and twisted. Tortured.

Bolg says something bad is coming and Tark agrees

Tark heads to the Establishment to tell his friends


The group gathers in Over the Moon and Patches makes her case for a quick (less than 24 hour) visit to the city of Dokkar in Svartalfheim

Cirrus wishes to go, Patches does and Gundren wishes to find information there

Only Tark is hesitant to go and reiterates that he thinks something bad is going to happen.

Patches reiterates the short nature of the trip and that she needs to see her brother, Finn, that she stashed there.  She needs to know he’s safe.

They ask Feanon if he can stay in contact with this plane in case of emergency and the Wizard assures them that he can.

From a private room in the Establishment, Cirrus planeshifts them to the Dark Elf City of Dokkar, in the plane of Svartalfheim

They find themselves in the main plaza before the city gates 

The floor is made of marble threaded with silver and a platinum fountain of dancing Elves dominates the center

The first ring of the city extends in either direction and dead ahead, the ramp begins for access to the next tier of the city

Great obsidian walls gleam in the pale moonlight that pierces the titanic cavern’s ceiling

Motes of light can be seen drifting steadily, like a soft snow from the heavens

The place is otherworldly and enchantingly beautiful

It is also far busier than they have seen it on previous trips

There is a bustle of traders, craftsman and caravaners all seemingly organizing for a huge trip

Interested in the activity, but tired from the long day in the Desert, the group looks to the nearby Inns to find a room for the night.
