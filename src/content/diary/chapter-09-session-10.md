The group splits up, though most remain behind at Feanons tower in case of further attacks from the Sovereignty.

The Wizard has work to do.

Patches heads to her Establishment, stopping by her shrine to pray before sending word again for Mordenkainen and asking The Network if Lo’Dan had responded yet.

No Mordenkainen - so much so he’s not even on the same plane.

Lo’Dan however HAS checked in and has escaped Mantol Derith and is returning to the surface.

Patches returns in the early hours of the morning and tells Feanon that Mordenkainen cannot help him.

Feanon takes his reverie so as not to become exhausted and then gets to work assembling the pieces of artifice he had ordered.

In a bit of a panic though, Fea scours his mind and those of his assistants for a way to actually cast the Cloning spell he’s preparing for.

He intends to give the Sovereignty a clone of himself rather than let The Surgeon cut him open…

Thorna ends up sleeping against the Chardalyn Sarcophagus in the lab, but Cirrus begins to explore the tower.

He finds it’s magnificent halls and chambers remarkably empty.

As he descends the staircase into the main foyer, he notes the sun beginning to rise (despite the Chrome eyes) and sees a figure in the ruined doorway of Feanons tower.

An old human woman stands there leaning on a cane, with silver hair done up in a poofy bun and a blue dress with white apron and a nice looking leather bag in the crook of one arm.

She smiles at Cirrus as he approaches and introduces her as Barbara, but asks that he use her nickname: MiMaw.

Cirrus welcomes the strange old lady but is quickly put on alert when Mimaw reveals that she is an emissary sent from the Sovereignty.

The tone of the conversation changes instantly and Cirrus begins to negotiate.

The Sovereignty explains the need to test the group and Feanon, to know if they are prey or peer and offer a weregild (blood money) for the three deaths that occured.

As an additional show of good faith, half of the prisoners are released and the woman releases these bizarre and disgusting amniotic sacks from her bag of holding.

Tark, who had arrived and watched the ongoing conversation (throwing shade at the Sovereignty every now and then) rushes over and opens the sacks with Thornas help (who had since wandered down to the foyer).

As the negotiations continue, the group gradually all arrive to be a party to the discussion.

The Aboleths are trying to trade the last four prisoners for a look at Feanons brain so they can determine *why* he was able to resist enslavement.

The group is not having any of it.

They are given 8 hours to make a decision before the portal to the Plane of Water collapses.

Mimaw heads to the lake and waits there, calmly observing the sunlit waters of the spring morning.

Tark goes to her and watches her intently.

Hours go by and eventually he asks her why she seems to be working for the Sovereignty.

She explains that she’s over 300 years old, she awakes for periods and sleeps for others, her mind and memories a part of the Sovereignty.

She is a part of something eternal, neither evil nor good.

She offers to give Tark a glimpse of the Sovereignty and holds out her hand.

The Monk takes it and feels his mind expand.

He sees a great ocean of currents and flows; Psionic energy and all around him are minds and memories.

Brushing one he sees the life of a peasant, another, that of a predatory monster.

All of it though is operating in harmony, directed by currents.

From the vast ocean a leviathan of a mind and memories appears, surrounded by smaller minds like pilot fish following a whale.  Tark greets it, and the Aboleth greets him back.

Tark ends the experience, snapping out of the meditative-like state.

He thanks Mimaw and takes his leave, thinking on the experience.


Meanwhile, The interior of the Tower has been hectic.

Feanon contacts his old friend Sejuk of Silverymoon, hoping that he can cast a Cloning spell, despite being illegal. Though he cannot remember why…

Sejuk cannot help him and mentions that the only “person” he can think of to have such a rare and illegal spell would be Larloch, the First Lich, last seen in the Warlocks Crypt north of Baldur’s Gate.

Though the reclusive and utterly deadly Lich has not been seen in centuries.

This does not help and Feanon wracks his brain for answers.

Just as he’s about to resign himself to his fate and give in to the demands of the Barony, he remembers Manshoon.

The once leader of the Zhentarim, Manshoon was notorious for cloning himself about two centuries back.

He has Patches send a missive to Lady Faye, asking for any information on the old leader.


Meanwhile, Thorna has been trying to get answers as she finds herself surrounded by learned people.

She sees Feanon inquire with the Sage, Beryan and asks some questions of the Elf after.

Beryan is a bit exasperated by all thats going on, but calms down and agrees to help, sending a message to the libraries of Evermeet for information on Auril and Issgard, the magical hammer Thorna wields.

Still not satisfied, Thorna almost leaves the Barony to head to the libraries of Silverymoon (and tries to ship herself off to the Plane of Water in a sack, unsuccessfully), but is persuaded to remain with the group and head into the Underdark instead - To the Library of Gravenhollow for answers.

She (after finding out Gusieppe is an sexist ass) heads outside, maybe the old lady will have some answers for her.

Mimaw looks her over, studying her.

After a few minutes she clucks her tongue and nods to herself and proclaims that the reason Thorna cannot remember her past, is that she has none.

Thorna is only a few weeks old, she is a completely new person, a blank slate, though Mimaw suspects this to be for a purpose…

Tark heads back to the Keep to check on the general population, stopping by the town on the way to look for any more dead.

He finds a half dissolved foot, but thats all.  The town is still mostly deserted and the signs of the Aboleth breakin are everywhere - broken doors and windows.

Tark climbs up to the keep and is let in immediately.

For the first time, he sees that the Keep is actually fairly well manned and meets up with Gundren distributing weapons to the citizenry in the main courtyard.

Tark hopes to find those who lost people in the attack, but no one really stands out from the crowd and those he asks havent lost anyone recently.

Tark heads back to New Daggerford to the Alchemy shop to get them brewing potions of water breathing and Gundren stops by the Orcs to arm them before heading to Feanons tower.

To his surprise, Marzeline says they have been brewing them all night and hands him six.

When asked, she responds that after people were kidnapped by fishmen, she figured the group might have to go after them.

Tark compliments the young ladies foresight and hands her 170gp and then rushes out of the door, back to the Fea’s tower.


Patches gets a response from Lemerlais and Lady Faye.

The letter is cryptic and strangely written, suggesting strongly that the two of them have information on Manshoon.

The duo request the teleportation sigil to come and visit and Feanon agrees.

Thirty minutes later, Patches arrives back at the lab leading three women; A human, an Elf and a Halfling.

Lady Faye and Lemerlais enter the lab, their commanding demeanor reminding everyone of their status and personal power.

The Halfling however is the complete opposite, almost bumbling.

The short woman has curling black hair, ruddy skin, green eyes and freckles and is carrying a massive backpack covered in boxes.

Lady Faye introduces Chantelle, the Halfling Archaeologist of Candlekeep.

It turns out that this trio have quite the treasure trove on Manshoon.

Lady Faye has been trying to find ways to extend her human lifespan with the help of Lemerlais.

Using her contacts, Lady Faye has been searching for magic or means to do so and Manshoons notes and cloning technology have always been a goal.

Chantelle has been helping gather information and artefacts and found a key piece of the puzzle - A Scroll of Cloning, penned by the Zhentarim leader himself.

The issue for the three Zhentarim is that none of them had the facilities or equipment needed for the spell to be cast - but Feanon does.

A deal is struck, and in exchange for the spell scroll, Feanon will build (With Gundren’s help) a cloning facility for Lady Faye.

Patches gleeflully collects (and a little extra) the flesh from Feanons arm for the spell as everyone looks on in horror (or amusement) as the Wizard then casts the spell.

It takes and hour and appears to be much more of an alchemical affair, turning on burners, distilling fluid etc.

After an hour, the main cloning tank is filled with sterile compound and the lump of flesh hangs suspended, motes of tissue already beginning to grow around it.

Feanon curses though, the math just doesnt work out for him, it will take a week to grow this clone and the Sovereignty wont wait…

He heads to the lakeshore with the group (The Zhentarim remaining in the lab, taking notes).

During this, Cirrus took a sheet of lead from Fea’s lab and kept it near the Plane of Water portal at the bottom of the lake, attuning it to The Plane of Water over the many hours.  He has Gundren fashion it into a tuning fork later that day.


They meet Mimaw at the shoreline.

She assures Feanon that he will survive the process unharmed and even summons The Surgeon so Feanon can meet him.

From the lake walks a humanoid in a thick rubbery encounter suit with a glass faceplate, water sloshing within.

It walks as if weighted down and sloshes from the water.

Not liking the look of him one bit, Tark slashes the suit, tearing it and causing saltwater to flood from it, revealing pallid amphibious flesh within.

The strange creature falls back into the water and extricates itself from the suit, revealing a disgusting creature.

Pallid translucent skin, elongated appendages ending not in hands and feet but masses of tentacles and a head more reminiscent of a Monk fish than the Sea Elf it once was.

Feanon is disgusted and fascinated as he notes the tentacles of the creature appear to go as fine as hairs and he understands *how* they intend to look into his brain.

The surgeon is escorted up to the lab

And promptly captured in the Aboleth tank.

Down below Mimaw laughs at the turn of events as the group tries to leverage the release of the Surgeon for their prisoners.

The Surgeon Dimension doors back to the lake and swims into its depths.

As Mimaw leaves, she turns back and tells the group that the portal and their people wait below.

She descends into the water...but Cirrus rushes forwards and thrusts the Iron Tuning fork into her side, plane shifting her to the Abyss...

The group begins to prep to head to The Plane of Water.

Cirrus though begins to pace at the waters edge, confident that he is calling the Sovereignty’s bluff.

As the time diminishes, several of the group drink the potions of Water Breathing and begin to head into the lake.

As they do, the last of the amniotic sacks are sent through the portal and back to the barony.

They arrive on the shore and are quickly opened, revealing the last few prisoners.

The Sovereignty relents and Cirrus lets out a cackle of victory.
