Tark is holed up in the bathroom, in the process of pounding the stone with his fists, wrecking the place

Patches knocks on the door and asks what is wrong.  Tark does not respond.

The others, Doc and JmJm nearby explain what they discovered - that **Kenshi** does not exist and Tark has been manipulated.

They also tell her of the fate of **Gaddock**.

Snorbul grabs a stool and sets it up outside the bathroom, trying to comfort his new friend.

JmJm begins to twang away as a small lyre, singing Tark's favorite song while Doc B uses his Druidcraft to have small tundra flowers begin growing under the door.

The flowers, reminding Tark of his homeland, causes him to lash out harder.

Patches meanwhile is wracking her brain, when did this happen? 

The group thinks about it and determine that** Kenshi** had first communicated just after the winter Solstice - the return of **Zhyenghi** .

In retrospect, the group realizes their error, and how they had been played.

Vowing to learn from their mistake, Cirrus realizes the message from his Goddess about the **Pearl of non-detection**, and why she bade him have it.

They wake Droki on the couch and remind the Warlock of his agreement to take them to **Bilrigger.**

The group heads out from the townhouse, leaving JmJm and Doc to comfort Tark as Cirrus refuses to be sidetracked when they are so close to finding another Warlock of **Ceregorach**.

The group have the Halfling behind the desk call them set of Rickshaws and the group makes to the Hall of Sacred Scrolls with time to spare.

Heading through the massive Adamantine gates into the restricted section of the city, the Group notes the increased guard presence

Disturbingly, the increase in guards consists almost exclusively of Devils, strange baby-faced, metal masked creatures called Merrogons

The creatures take no interest in the group and they approach a large, unique looking structure.

Built into one of the massive stone pillars that supports the roof, far overhead, the Hall of Sacred Scrolls looks like a combination of Petra and the Parthenon, a massive columned, temple-like carving from the living rock of the cavern.

Impressed at the scale of the Duergar "Library", they head inside and are greeted with a bustle of activity.

The entire interior of the structure is one massive, spiralling library, ascending and descending within the column.

Filled with thousands of scrolls and books, seen to by hoards of scholarly slaves and all facilitated by a truly impressive complex of elevators and scroll-carrying devices; like a magazine in a massive battleship loading shells.

Impressed, but quickly following the disguised Droki, the group are led to the nearest elevator - but not before Fey calls over a Clerk to have them look into Ancient Netherese translations.

Descending the Hall, the group rides the Iron Elevator all the way to the bottom of the structure, after paying the fine of course.

Droki then leads them into the older tunnels beneath the Hall of Sacred Scrolls, descending farther and farther, until he tells them they are about to enter the Whorlstone Caverns.

Fey can feel the tingling of magical energies around him, the place is suffused with Wild-Magic from the Faerzress.

It takes a good twenty minutes to get through the winding tunnels.  Having to tear through spiderwebs, and Cirrus intimidating Droki into taking a Shortcut he didnt want to...

Arriving without significant incident, the group finds themselves coming into a large tunnel, curving off in front of them, circling an amphitheater-like room past an open set of stone double doors.

The Council of Derro Savants is having a meeting beneath the Hall of Sacred Scrolls, a common occurrence it seems.

The craft of this place is crude and clearly not Duergar. 

Droki takes the group to a nearby waiting room - little better than a cell, and then heads in to the meeting to let Bilrigger know he has guests.

Patches sneaks in after him and spies on the content of the meeting

meanwhile, the others are implored by Cirrus to "do what they must" in the coming fight; sure it will come to that.

Snorbul notices something odd: an eyeball watching them from a nearby wall and points it out to Fey.

The group realizes they are being watched and Fey identifies it as something a Beholder can do within its domain.

Patches meanwhile sees the beast itself, a massive floating head with tendrils capped in eyeballs and with a large sharklike mouth: a Beholder

The beholder, **O'alla **in name seems to be the leader, or at least mediator of the Derro Savants.

Patches watches as the different factions engage in politics, blaming one another (one being blamed for creating far too many Vampires).

She hears a few names and plots, such as the name **Milgre** and that the Savants seem to be behind the theft of the Red Dragon Egg, though it is held by the local Thieves Guild.

She leaves, thinking it important to inform the group of the Beholder and sneaks back to the "waiting room"

They exchange information, knowing they have no choice but to accept that the Beholder can see them and just keep doing what they came to do.

The Council meeting wraps up a short time later and Droki returns, telling them that his master will see them now.

Heading deeper into the complex, Droki takes the group to a much nicer chamber.

With rich wooden doors, and expert craftsmanship, the group is led into a private dining chamber belonging to Bilrigger, an apparent high ranking member of the Savants.

Walking over plush red carpet to enter the dining room, they are greeted with opulence: couches, wooden furniture, and what appears to be an Enamel or Ivory floor.

A rich dining table, fully prepared with a meal and beautiful finery lies before them and at its head sits a strange looking Derro Savant.

In Grey robes with ivory buttons and beadlike embroidery, the decoration creates an almost plantlike pattern and exudes wealth.

His face is small and twisted into a perpetual snarl, a snarled and patchy white beard growing on his chin.  His bald pate shines in the firelight.

The scowl on the Derro Savants face twists into a toothy smile - perfect teeth reflecting the orange glow of the hearth.

**Droki **introduces the group to his master: **Bilrigger**, Warlock of Ceregorach

Snorbul goes and sits right next to **Bilrigger **and begins digging into the food.

Cirrus sits nearby while the others spread out around the table, sitting, but remaining at the ready and quite on edge (though Gundren begins eating heartily).

Cirrus and Bilrigger begin to talk to one another, going back and forth trying to convince the other to abandon their respective Patron.

Bilrigger aruges that everythikng Ceregorach did, was to make Cirrus stronger.  He suffered greatly, but look how far he has come because of that strength?

Bilrigger also notes that with his blind eyes, if Selune wished, she could abandon Cirrus and leave him crippled.  The "gift" is a leash.

Cirrus balks, Selune is everything, and loves him.  

She has given him the true power.  

His survival of Ceregorach was incidental compared to the power granted by the moon.

They continue arguing, growing more and more heated until they both leap to their feet, all but yelling at one another...and Cirrus slams his staff into the ground just as Bilrigger raises his hands in a summoning gesture.

The floor ripples, made of millions of teeth that part as dark creatures pull themselves into the material world from the Faewilds

Cirrus's spell goes off, creating a globe of invulnerability around him and Bilrigger.

Snorbul snaps forward, grabbing the villain with a yell, going int a berserker rage and fastening had hand over Bilrigger's mouth with an Iron Grip.

The strange fae creatures leap into motion. 

There are dozens of the tings looking like a small, deranged human preying mantis and the other like a large, squat Gorilla if it was mostly meat, jaws and teeth.

The others, expecting something like this, leap into combat - Gundren opening up with his cannon on the larger minions, Fey slamming every enemy in the room repeatedly with Gravity manipulation and Patches leaping across the table to gut the Warlock quickly.

Snorbul prevents Bilrigger from saying a word.  The warlock's greatest weapon, his speech, is useless.

The minions are blasted by Gundren and pulverized by the intense gravity of Fey's spell, meanwhile Cirrus begins to attack Bilrigger's face and mouth with his dagger (cutting out his tongue), going for the green tooth while Patches systematically begins cutting leg tendons so he can't get away. In retrospect, you guys scarily murdered the shit out of him...

As Bilrigger slips into unconsciousness, Cirrus enacts a dreaming to speak directly into his mind.

Cirrus finds a grey, Smokey dreamscape, and a creature made entirely of teeth.

Cirrus implores Bilrigger one last time to abandon Ceregorach and the toothy creature laughs, teeth rasping against one another.

The creature explodes in death and Cirrus awakes back in the real world, the Simulacrum of Bilrigger, tearing apart into its base material - teeth.

Fey immediately informs everyone what happened (Simulacrum).

Gundren and Patches begin to scour and loot the room (art pieces) and find a lockbox behind a painting.  

Disarming the trapped box...barely, and unlocking it, they pocket a +1 dagger and a hat of Disguise.

Meanwhile, Cirrus has scooped up many teeth of the Simulacra and approaches Droki, the little guy happy he decided not to get involved.

He's as surprised as the group is that this Bilrigger was a fake, but he knows of one other location the REAL Bilrigger could be, though he has never entered Bilrigger's Private Sanctum...

The group takes stock of themselves, they are relatively hurt, but can keep going (especially as Cirrus demands it).

They do decide to head back and pick up Tark, and have Doc heal everyone a little.

They backtrack through the same tunnels that got them down to the Savant chambers, the place now empty save for a few stragglers.

It takes about an hour, but they make it back to the Town House to collect Tark.

As they go through the hall of Sacred Scrolls, Cirrus sets up an appointment for the next day with the Hall's head Scribe, the only one that knows the language of the Ancient Netherese: **Lola.**

They find him still holed up in the now utterly destroyed bathroom.

Patches tries to coax Tark out, cracking the door (as much as it can) and peeking inside, she asks him what his master would want him to do.

She also then berates him for smashing up the place and that she needs to use the restroom if he can hurry up.

Cirrus and Fey talk with Doc and have him try and scry on the remains of the Simulacrum, to no effect.

Doc returns to try and help Tark, and seeing that the door is cracked open, pushes a small crown of flowers into the bathroom for his friend.

Tark sees it and stands up, walking over to the door and shatters it with a rapid succession of strikes, the slablike pieces falling outwards in a heap.

Tark walks directly over to Cirrus, and demands that he be told everything the group knows of **Milgre**, the Derro Savant of Orcus.

Cirrus wants to head directly back to the Savant Chambers, which is a great place to gather information on Milgre.

Just in case, Tark walks up to Droki and smacks him right in the face, demanding to be taken to her.

Droki swears and says he will take them to the only person he knows might know: **O'Alla, the Beholder**

Patches finally gets to use the restroom, though is surprised by Doc as he checks to see the state of the damage, Patches waving the little cat away.

Doc and JmJm heal up the party, deciding to stay behind with Snorbul, the little Gnome deciding that he needs to "fix" the bathroom.

The group heads quickly back to the Hall of Sacred scrolls.  

Tark notes a strange feeling on the air, a subtle, rising tension.

They enter the Hall and Tark yells out for **MILGRE!!!!!!**

The entire place goes quiet, and every set of eyes focuses on the group.

They are quickly apporached by a dozen angry looking scribes and an equal number of guards.

Spotting the Dragon's Gold badges, the outright hostility melts to barely contained anger.  How DARE someone enter here and just start yelling.

Tark demands information on Milgre, and the group pays the disturbance fine.

Information ripples in from around the library as information on **Milgre **is collected.

The information is sparse, but the mysterious and little known **"Milgre"** was apparently last seen descending into the old tunnels beneath The Hall of Sacred Scrolls.

The group thanks the Duergar and take their leave, descending quickly back into the Savant's Meeting hall.

Now completely deserted, the group easily return.  Tark stalks directly into the main amphitheater and begins yelling for the Beholder to appear.

After a few minutes, the drapes behind the stage flap open, and the massive floating creature gracefully floats onstage, its strange robes fluttering behind it.

Tark demands any information on **Milgre.**

The Beholder **O'Alla** is intrigued by the group, but bored by Tark's demanding tone.  It won't help out of the goodness of its heart.

Tark says that the group will rid the Derro of **Milgre **and her vampire spawn that the other Derro had complained about.

With her interest piqued, **O'Alla **considers, and offhandedly mentions that she was last seen going to visit Bilrigger in his Sanctum.

The group also try to leverage the extermination of the Vampires in exchange for the Red Dragon egg.

**O'Alla **is surprised they know She and her Savants were involved.  She will think about it, but she doubts she will come to a favorable decision for the party.

The group presses on, deeper into the Whorlstone Caverns with Droki as their guide.

Tark grows impatient and begins to threaten Droki.

With the various skills of the group, they easily stay on track, Droki eventually leading the group to a large water-filled and well lit cavern.

Glowing fungi of all sorts pepper the large, wet chamber.  A large central island rises from the water, covered in a small forest of the Fungi.

Around the island, splash a good dozen Myconids, the bizarre Mushroom men splashing around in a rhythym.

Atop the large island, two gargantuan Myconids shift, each easily over 15ft tall, and just as wide.

Standing nearby is a small Myconid Sprout.

Tark ignores this strange event, following Droki across the cavern, the others in close pursuit and wishing to avoid distractions.

As they go past though, Stool, peeking from Patches pack, notes the other Myconids and is shocked by their actions.

They have no concept of dance.

Patches goes to the other baby Myconid and makes contact, the creature calling itself Rumpadump

the small thing doesnt know what's going on, only that his fellows are acting strangely and it scares him.

Across the cavern, Tark and Cirrus note two humanoids, bloated by massive fungal growths, their species no longer identifyable.

They look like the fungal corpse they came across on their descent into the Underdark...

The massive creatures atop the plateau shake out a massive cloud of spores to try and talk with Fey, who approaches curious.

The spores to not connect with Fey, yet he still hears in his mind the booming voice of the Myconid Sovereign.

They thing asks the group to join them in the "Lady's Dream".  The group refuses and the Myconid sighs in sadness.

The massive troupe then all approach the large glowing Zurkhwood tree in the center of the mount, and melt into it, vanishing in a Tree Stride.

They scoop up Rumpadump and continue on their way, giving the strange fungal corpses a wide berth.

Patches is the last out and just as she leaves the chamber, hears a familiar droning buzzing.

She ducks into the shadows and watches as two Chasme demons rush into the chamber.

They spot the Fungal corpses and call them "Servants of Zuggtomy" before rushing in to attack them, they also mention that they are looking for a way into Gracksuluth.

Patches vacates the area quickly and catches back up with the group.

After another twenty minutes, Droki announces that they have arrived.

A non-descript and rather mundane section of the Whorlstone expanse lies in front of them, a series of large stone pillars being lit by the glittering Faerzress crystals and small phosphorescent fungi of the cavern.

Going around the pillars, the group sees a door, sliced from the wall and made to look like the natural surrounding stone.

On closer inspection, the metal hinges are sliced almost impossibly clean.

Tark wraps shadow around the group as they approach, and Patches steps into the deepest patch of shadow she can find.

Her judgement is a little too good though and she steps through a crack in the planar boundries and enters the border Ethereal Plane close to the Shadowfell.

Seeing the world in flickering shades of smokey darkness, and all souls and magic as glowing bonfires of energy, Patches realizes what happened.

She sees some strange creatures moving around the area and decides now is not a good time.  She turns and steps back through the inadvertently discovered gate.

Back in the Prime Material, the rest of the group is none the wiser.

Tark enters Bilrigger's Sanctum, Droki wisely refusing to enter.

Tark goes invisible and looks around the main entry room.

A large stone chamber, supported by ornate pillars of black marble and shining stone floor lays before him.  At the far end is a statue of a Derro.

There are signs of a struggle throughout the chamber, and what furniture was here is smashed and broken.

Ahead, Tark notes two forms hunched over a puddle of blood, lapping at the liquid hungrily; Vampires.

Tark attacks in tandem with the rest of the group and they quickly tear the vampires apart, though take a few claw wounds in the process.

The beasts make a ruckus as they die though and other screeches can be heard deeper in the Sanctum.

Realizing that the stealthy approach is spent, the group rushes into action.

Presented with two hallways, Gundren and Tark take one, with Patches and Cirrus taking the other, Fey remaining in the back to support either group.

moving forwards cautiously, both hallways lead to opulent chambers, both showing signs of struggle (smashed furniture).  Both have slight movement within...

Vampire spawn drop from the ceiling in both instances, rushing forwards to engage as the two Warlock minions of Milgre dart from behind cover and begin to cast spells.

Gundren pulls an Opal from his helm and tosses it, Daylight erupting from the gem and scorching the Vampires before beginning to pump out shots.

Tark casts silence on Rilka, the red robed Derro Warlock just as her Chain lightning goes off, slamming Gundren, Tark and Fey.

Partches mask illusion rushes forward, distracting her enemies and allowing her to get into position.

Patches sneaks forward into her room, spotting the Vampires and the other Warlock, she plants a satchel charge on the diving wall and then detonates it, showering Rilka with shrapnel and flooding both rooms with sunlight (burning her own eyes).

Rilka retreats to her companion, leaving the silence, but Tark pursues.

Patches unloads two precise shots into Rilka and her companion, but both have spells active that lessen the deadly impacts.

Rilka dispels the daylight, but Gundren simply pulls another gem and tosses it.

Meanwhile Cirrus has gotten surrounded by Vampire spawn but is pummeling them with Eldritch blasts, pushing them back with each hit.  He summons a flaming sphere to cascade down the hallway, burning the vampires.

Fey at the back has a different problem to contend with, the statue of Bilrigger has drained and a set of steps resolves, leading deeper into the Sanctum, filled with mist.

A spell is hurled into the mist and it resolves into a Vampire, leaping from the stairwell and rushing Fey.

**Milgre, **Vampire Savant, charms Fey and then turns her attention to Cirrus.

not wanting to see his friends fight, Fey enacts a wall of ice to separate all the parties, but the Vampire destroys a section and rushes Cirrus who is forced to enact his tomb of Levistus (ice block).

Feeling that something was wrong with the situation, Fey pushes against the charm spell and manages to break it.

Tark finishes off the wounded Rilka, as she falls to the ground, Tark smashes her head, crushing it and moves on to the other Warlock

Gundren finishes off the Vampires facing him, with assistance from Fey

Cirrus comes out of his Ice block and enacts a wall of force just as Milgre begins to flee, turning invisible.

The wall of force seperates all the Vampires from the group and imprisons the last Warlock apprentice of Milgre.

With things looking so Dire for the bad guys, the Warlock servant of Milgre decides to flee and Dimension Doors out to safety.

Patches rushes back to the main room and hears from Fey that the Vampire is invisible.  Thinking quickly, Patches Faerie fires the doorway out of the Sanctum and catches the Vampire in the light, enshrouding her in harmless flames.

Cirrus, already rushing in that direction, catches the momentarily stunned vampire and jams the Planar tuning fork into her side, Plane-shifting the shocked Vampire to the Astral Plane...
