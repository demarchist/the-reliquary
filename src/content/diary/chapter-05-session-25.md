## Turning the Tide

The castle shook. More chunks cracked free and began floating in the teleportation spell's strange energies. Patches flanked the vampire thrall in the chapel hall and cut him down. Mordenkainen obliterated Ludmilla and rushed to the chapel entrance. Gundren backed off from Rahadin and shot at the Atropal shadow, both shells connecting. Fëanon followed with a chromatic orb of lightning that burned the shadow further.

Rahadin shifted and breathed a cone of paralysing gas. Tark screamed a warning. Everyone held their breath or dove aside. The gas dissipated without claiming a single victim. The dragon let out a growl of frustration.

Ezmerelda launched a lightning bolt at the shadow — the blast disintegrated nearby soulless, burned away most of the Atropal's essence, and struck Rahadin, obliterating his shield and stunning the dragon. Cyrrus drew on the spirit of Argynvost for healing, downed a potion, and slammed two eldritch blasts into the dragon's skull before ducking into cover. Stick grabbed a massive slab of rock with telekinesis and slammed it onto Rahadin's back. Danica shot one of the vampire thralls from above.

Tark bounced off a piece of floating rubble, leapt at the stunned dragon, and unleashed a flurry of blows — some glancing off scales, others cracking bone. The wereraven archers peppered Rahadin from cover.

Rahadin's shadow aura regenerated from the soulless rushing past. He rose and turned his full fury on Buumi, knocking the paladin unconscious with a storm of claw and tail. "I will kill anyone I knock down," the dragon promised. JmJm exploded into the Goblin King form. The vampire thralls cut into Cyrrus from behind, hurting the warlock badly.

JmJm did a goblin jig, slapped Buumi across the face, and screamed at the paladin to get up — healing magic surging through the blow. Buumi gasped and started to rise. Rahadin spun a full three-sixty with his tail. Tark dove on top of Buumi, pushing him clear but taking the hit himself. JmJm dodged.

Cyrrus accepted that he was going to die. He muttered a prayer, teleported sixty feet into the air above the battlefield, and began falling — firing eldritch blasts at the dragon. The Atropal rose again at Buumi's feet, feeding on the paladin's life force and regenerating Rahadin's shield. Gibra rushed forward with a scroll from Tark and cast mass cure wounds — healing Buumi, Cyrrus, JmJm, Gundren, Ezmerelda, and herself. Rahadin roared in fury.

Tark cursed the dragon, promising retribution, and shadowstepped above the Atropal to smash it from a piece of rubble. The shadow drained life from Buumi, Tark, and JmJm, rejuvenating itself. Rahadin bit at the distracted JmJm — the bard ducked aside, teeth tearing flesh but not snapping shut. The dragon prepared shadow flame.

## The Chapel

Ireena could not keep up with Strahd. She pushed through the burning energy waves to reach the altar, staggered and hurt, and pulled the two journals from her belt. She presented Sergei's last entry. Strahd read it — once, twice — and it began to dawn on him. Ireena told him Rahadin had murdered her dozens of times across the centuries. Strahd was convinced.

Mordenkainen rushed to the chapel's edge and called Stick for help. The sentient staff teleported in and cast a protective shield over Ireena. Strahd could not stop his spellcasting without destroying the castle. Ireena said Mordenkainen would take over. Strahd glared at the archmage but trusted his wife. He relented. Mordenkainen teleported to the altar and assumed control of the spell. Strahd grabbed Ireena — she flinched — and carried her to safety, rushing past the vampire thralls who turned away from Patches at his approach.

## The Final Breath

Rahadin breathed shadow flame across the battlefield. Everyone dove for cover. JmJm crumpled to the ground, reverting to his half-elf form, unconscious. Tark screamed a warning too late. The vampire thralls turned their heads as if hearing a new directive and rushed Rahadin — Strahd had turned them against the traitor.

Rahadin saw JmJm fall and slammed a massive claw down, crushing the bard — hanging on to life by a thread. Cirrus fell from above, blasted the Atropal, touched JmJm, and teleported both of them back into the air — snatching the bard from under Rahadin's descending jaws. The dragon roared in frustration.

Patches hurled her last fireball earring, detonating it on the edge of the blast to clip Rahadin's head and wings. She called on her luck blade, grabbed a wingtip, and launched herself onto his haunches, fastening a climbing anchor into place.

Fëanon rushed to the fallen Cyrrus and stabilised the hypothermic warlock with fire magic. Rahadin, frenzied, spun and breathed icy death at Tark, Cyrrus, Fëanon, and JmJm's corpse. Tark screamed a warning. They took what cover they could. Fëanon barely shielded himself. Everyone else dropped unconscious. JmJm — already broken — was frozen solid. Dead.

Strahd ripped Rahadin's throat out. Blood fountained across the marble floor. The dragon gurgled a roar, dying but still on his feet.

Danica loosed a final crossbow bolt from her floating perch. It drove into the dragon's eye and through his brain.

Everything slowed. The magnificent silver dragon reeled and fell, limp and still. Blood poured from hundreds of wounds. Rahadin breathed his last.

## Sunrise

From one of Rahadin's ears, a deluge of blood poured forth and the small Atropal that had lived inside him spilled out, wailing as it died. Patches walked up and stabbed it with the Reaver, feeding the cursed blade and destroying the creature utterly.

A flash of light and a shockwave ripped through the castle. When they rose, stars filled the sky above a landscape that was not Barovia — a rocky, sandy expanse of desolate desert and the beautiful moon of Faerûn surrounded by asteroids. The castle settled. Outlying chunks of rock dropped a thousand feet to the desert floor. The army of the dead circled languidly overhead, purposeless. The vampire thralls stood confused.

Buumi knelt before JmJm's frozen body and began to pray. After long moments, he laid his hands on the corpse. Golden light covered the body as it thawed. JmJm sat up gasping, remarked on what a rush that was, and flopped back to the floor. He crawled to Waldo's body and tried to raise the dead man — but sensed peace. Waldo would not return.

The halos around Patches and Cyrrus dimmed as the spirits of Argynvost and Anduriel completed their purpose and departed. Fëanon examined the floating castle fragments and thought their levitation might be permanent. He was too exhausted to be sure.

Every Barovian suddenly cocked their head as if hearing a voice. Lathander offered each a choice: live a mortal life, or accept his embrace and be taken to rest.

Ireena took Strahd's hand. The vampire caressed his wife's face and closed his eyes. The castle trembled as it disgorged thousands of vampires and undead into the rising sun. Screams cascaded as the army burned to ash and the swirling spectres disintegrated. Strahd began to smoke.

Patches rushed to the chapel to loot the vampire brides' jewellery, the old corpses, and the chapel valuables. She started wearing the platinum skull mask. She found the artifact still floating above the altar — inert, completely drained. Fëanon staggered in and mage-handed it into his bag of holding.

Tark lounged in a sunbeam — the first true sunlight in weeks. Buumi saw JmJm alive and flopped onto the ground, exhausted. Tark sat beside him, took a drink from Buumi's flask, and they high-fived. Tark asked what to do about Strahd. Buumi thought the truth had made him no longer a threat.

Every thrall strode into sunbeams and burst into flame. Strahd was shaking with effort. He turned and began walking into the light. Behind him, a breeze wafted through and Ireena crumbled to dust, accepting Lathander's call. Tears streaming, Strahd reached the front of the castle and sat down on the steps. Cyrrus followed to ensure he died.

Strahd looked at him. Cyrrus said Selûne would welcome him. Strahd doubted any celestial would have him after all he had done — but hoped Lathander would forgive him. The shadow aura burned away and Strahd was disintegrated by the rising sun, a massive vortex of shadow exploding from his remains before that too was consumed. All that was left was a pile of ash and items.

## Aftermath

Patches looked at Ireena's remains with concern and sadness. Gundren started ranting about treasure and resource gathering. Buumi pulled off a gauntlet and hurled it at the dwarf, telling him to shut up and read a room. Fëanon caught Gundren's eye and made a calming gesture.

Herti and Gibra looked at one another, turned into ravens, and flew off into the sunrise — knowing freedom for the first time in their lives. Danica shifted into a giant raven and flew up through the wreckage to find her children safe inside the tiny hut. The survivors of Krezk were dust, having answered Lathander's call. Kitty and Aurora peered out, two massive lions huddled with the children. Chekhov was still there — he remembered all his past lives and, hearing Lathander's call, turned to dust. Mr. Pickles picked out the dagger he and Patches had given the boy, and choked back a single tear.

When Patches found out, she took the knife back and said he was a good kid. Kitty came up and they hugged. Aurora went to comfort Buumi.

Tark sat in the sunbeam and remarked that no one would believe their story. Fëanon tried the Tavern of Doors — the box opened easily, free of Barovia's enchantment at last. He looked out the front of the castle and saw desert stretching thirty miles to foothills and green. He recognised the edge of the Silver Marches — Silverymoon and Citadel Adbar were relatively nearby.

Mordenkainen slumped to the floor as his wounds knitted. He said he needed to sleep for a month. The group staggered into the Tavern of Doors for a much-needed rest.

Fëanon stayed outside. Ezmerelda stood stunned and at a loss, then started laughing — her quest was over. She sobered, remembering Van Richten's death. Fëanon said the old hunter went out exactly as he would have wanted. The mantle now fell to her. They shook hands and she turned to leave, then called back that she hoped they had an easy way down rather than climbing.

Tark sat beside Rahadin's corpse in a beam of sunlight, placed a hand on the dragon's head, and meditated — putting the grand creature to rest.

Inside the Tavern of Doors, Buumi and Gundren staggered through the front door. A goblin brought them drinks. From a plush chair, a small head poked up — a little girl, maybe four years old, with cream-coloured skin, shimmering black hair, and green cat-slit eyes. She frowned at the newcomers.
