Turn 1

Castle shakes, more chunks crack off and begin floating

Patches disengage, flank attacks vampire in hall. 

 Ireena talks to Strahd, tries to convince him with words, no luck, decides that evidence is the only thing that will work and rushes into the Chapel. 

Mordenkainen obliterates Ludmilla and then rushes to the entrance to the Chapel.

Gundren backs off from Rahadin and shoots at his shadow, hitting both shots.

Fey launches a chromatic orb at the Shadow, burning it with lightning.

The new vampires rush forwards to attack Herti and Gibra, the one in the hall attacks Patches and misses, being parried.

Rahadin tries to find a good breath target, shifting and breathes a cone of paralyzing gas over many targets, Tark calls out a warning and everyone holds their breath and/dives out of the way.

Rahadin lets out a growl of frustration as his breath attack fails completely.

The shadow is looking very rough, the aura around Rahadin diminished.

JmJm goes to attack Rahadin, but then decides to heal himself instead, throwing up a cloud of glitter.

Ezmerelda backs off and climbs on top of a chunk of rock, then turns against the shadow and launches a lightning bolt at it burning away much of it and the nearby villagers are disintegrated by the blast, the lightning hits rahadin, obliterating his shield and stuns Rahadin.  (quartz and rubber band style).

Cirrus then draws on the spirit of Argynvost to heal slightly, then downs a healing potion, then faces down Rahadin and pops off two Eldritch blasts which slam into the Dragons head.  He then ducks into cover.

Stick then grabs a huge slab of rock with telekinesis and slams it down on Rahadins back, crumbling it to dust. 

Danica from on high shoots one of the rushing Vampire Thralls beneath her attacking her nieces, he doesn't see where the shot comes from.

Tark then leaps off of the ground, bounces off a piece of rubble, then leaps at Rahadin for a powerful strike at the stunned dragon. then releases a flurry of blow on the dragon. Some hits cannot get through the scales, but some obviously damage.

Herti disengages and flies up to some floating chunks of rubble, then begins laying down shots into targets.  Gibra ducks out of the passwall and begins shooting at Rahadin, one hitting soft flesh but the other clatters off his scales.

Hollows rushing down the steps split to rush Gundren and Gwen, pushing into melee with them.

Buumi begins smashing down on Rahadin in his giant form, laying hit after hit on the dragon.  

Skeletons in the foyer rush in at Fey and surround him, some strike at one another damaging themselves, but others successfully hit Fey with their axes but his mage armor stops the wounds being deadly.

Gwen faces the hollows attacking her and begins shredding them with her claws and bites.  Claws the guts out of one, pounces on another.

Turn 2

Castle shakes and more chunks begin cracking off

Ireena rushes into the Chapel, getting hurt and staggered by the energy waves but pushes through the burning energy to get to Strahd.  Strahd looks at her in astonishment and is worried for her health.  Ireena pulls out the two journals and presents Sergei's last entry to him.  He reads it, over and over and it begins to dawn on him as it sinks in.  He's confused, Ireena tells Strahd Rahadin murdered her many many times and been keeping them apart.  Strahd is convinced.

Mordenkainen rushes to the edge of the energy wave and calls back to Stick, calling for help and Stick teleports to him and then attempts to protect Ireena with a shield from the artifact.

Patches keeps playing cat and mouse with the vampire in front of her, calling on the spirit of Anduriel to assist her.  The vampire is regenerating though.  She calls out to Modenkainen for help but he's occupied.

Fey is surrounded by skeletons and launches a fireball behind them so the edge of the blast catches the skeletons.  Two are burned to ash and two more and charred and melted so badly they can barely move, one is relatively unharmed having been shielded by a pillar.

Gundren then attempts to grapple a chunk of rock to throw it at some soulless but cannot get it to budge with no leverage, he instead climbs up to the same platform as Ezmerelda.  As he climbs up, a single Soulless jumps and grabs onto his boot to try and pull him down but is unsuccessful.

Rahadin stands up, his shadow aura rejuvenated and orange lightning cascading around him, he turns an angry glare on Buumi and lays into the Paladin with attacks.  Rahadin knocks Buumi unconscious with a flurry of powerful strikes and the enlargement on Buumi ends.

Tark screams for his downed friend, and Rahadin responds saying he will kill anyone he knocks down, not content with his enemies being unconscious.

JmJm explodes into the Goblin king upon seeing his friend go down.

The vampire thralls rush to attack Cirrus's back with longswords, cutting into the warlock, hurting him badly.  Cirrus screams in pain.

The thrall attacking Patches attempts to grab her to bite her, but she manages to twist and dart out of his grasp as she deflects the strike.

JmJm does a little goblin jig, then slaps Buumi across the face and screaming at the Paladin to get up, healing him and restoring him to consciousness.  Buumi gasps, beginning to sit up.

Ezmerelda launches a flurry of magic missiles at Rahadin, diminishing his shield.

Rahadin, seeing Buumi starting to get up, spins and swipes his tail at the recovering paladin, spinning a 360.  Tark dives on top of Buumi, pushing him out of the way but takes the hit instead.  JmJm dodges the hit.

Cirrus, accepts that he's going to die, injured as he is.  He glances around the pillar as he backs off of his attackers and mutters a prayer, teleporting 60ft above the battlefield and begins to fall, launching eldritch blasts at the dragon missing both but is directly above Rahadin.

Danica shoots at the same target as before, hitting one of Cirrus' attackers.  The vampire pulls the first quarrel from his shoulder just as the second stabs in, he spots his attacker but cannot get to her and looks around for another target now that Cirrus is gone.

The shadow re-appears and begins attacking Buumi, sucking the life from him and regenerating the shield for Rahadin.

Gibra rushes forwards and receives a scroll from Tark he covers Buumi.  Gibra rushes on past, pulls out the scroll and reads it, casting Mass Cure Wounds, rejuvenating Buumi, Cirrus, JmJm, Gundren, Ezmerelda and herself.  Rahadin roars in anger.

Herti shoots a volley of arrows at the surviving soulless, dropping two more.  Gwen now has significantly less to deal with.

Tark then mouths off to Rahadin, promising retribution and shadowsteps above the Shadow, launching off a chunk of rock and landing on the thing and smashing into it.

The shadow draws on Buumi, Tark and JmJm's life force, rejuvenating itself.

Tark calls out that they need to bring down the Shadow again.

Rahadin bites down at JmJm as the bard is distracted healing Buumi.  The full maw begins to close around the Bard, surely deadly, but at the last second.  The Bard ducks aside getting torn by teeth but not snapped up and killed. Rahadin prepares shadow flame to breathe on the group in front of him and Tark calls out a warning.

The hollows jam knives into Gwens gears, dealing little damage and one scratches Gundren as he climbs up to the floating rock.  The one on Gundren rushes over to join the group attacking Gwen

The atropal shadow tries to swipe at Buumi but the light of the Ashbringer forces it back away from him. it snakes in for a second attack though and rips at the Paladins life force.  Buumi is pale and shaking from the sapping.

The skeletons march in to try and hack at Fey, the two damaged ones swipe at one another rather than the mage and destroy themselves.  One slashes at Fey, hitting him.  Fey cracks a rib from the impact, the cuts being thwarted by his mage armor.  Two more skeletons appear at the castle entry.

Buumi heals himself, laying on hands for his remaining healing pool and then action points and casts cure wounds on himself, bolstering further.

Turn 3

Strahd knows Rahadin has betrayed him but cannot stop spellcasting or it will destroy the castle. Ireena says Mordenkainen will take over.  Strahd glares at Morden but he trusts his wife and relents, accepting the help from the Archmage.  Mordenkainen teleports and takes over the spell. Strahd turns away, grabs Ireena (who flinches in surprise) and rushes out of the Chapel, carrying his wife to safety and as he gets close to the Vampire thrall attacking Patches, the thrall turns away from fighting the rogue.

Patches  books it toward the main battle, scuttling behind a pillar and hiding in the shadows.

Fey disengages from his skeletal attackers and moves into the hall as the skeletons swipe at him, but only takes a glancing hit from an ancient weapon.   He then slams the doors of the castle shut in front of him and in a panic realizes there's no locking bar, but notes a magical lock and empowers it.

Rahadin breathes shadow flame across the battlefield, engulfing many.  Cirrus is just protected by a chunk of rock as he falls.  Everyone dives for cover as the flame jets out and no one is caught fully, even so, JmJm crumples to the ground and reverts back to his Half Elf form, unconscious. 

The vampire thralls all turn their heads as if hearing a new directive and rush towards Rahadin to attack the "traitor" and one begins swinging at the Atropal Shadow.

The cloying necrotic energy diminishes on the downed JmJm.

Ezmerelda casts a fire bolt at the Atropal, burning it slightly.

Rahadin sees JmJm go down and slams a massive claw down on the bard, crushing him badly, JmJm is hanging on to life by a thread.  

Danica begins launching bolts at the remaining soulless and drops two of them.

Cirrus falls and blasts away at the Shadow, hitting it badly.  Cirrus falls and just as he touches JmJm, teleports back into the air again, 60ft above the battlefield saving JmJm just as Rahadin is about to finish the Bard.  Rahadin had been tracking the descending bard and was looking forward to the splat and roars in frustration.

Gundren hops off his platform and targets the shadow, launching shells into the thing, missing a single shot but the other detonates on the Atropal.

Tark keeps laying into the shadow, fighting against it's life draining effects as he batters the thing and redoubles his attacks against the monster, smashing it's essence away.

Rahadin notes his Atropal getting seriously hurt and prepares himself for it's demise this time.

Gibra and Herti launch volleys of arrows into Rahadin, hitting several soft spots but others clatter off his scales.

Rahadin turns, seeing Fey and wants to bite the mage in half but the energy aura around Fey crackles and subtly convinces him otherwise and the Dragon turns back to Buumi, clamping his jaws down on Buumi's shoulder.  Buumi staggers and cries in pain as his armor bends from the force.

The Atropal looks up and sees Cirrus and JmJm falling and lets out a wail, trying to draw the life from Cirrus.  Cirrus quickly wards himself and manages to protect himself from the worst of the damage and he stays conscious.  The Atropal regains some health.

Buumi staggers as the Atropal saps his life force and the Paladin drops into unconsciousness.

Cirrus sees the paladin go down and digs deep, launching two more eldritch blasts at the shadow.

Gwen leaps at the shadow, obliterating it as she strikes it with her magical claws and the thing explodes, his aura gone.

This time, rahadin was ready and staggers, but manages to not be stunned this time.

Turn 4

The entire castle is broken and shattered, the second floor floating a good 6ft above where it should be.

Mordenkainen is badly burned and bleeding from the energy waves and staggers down to one knee but keeps the spell going.

Ireena follows Strahd, but cannot keep up and is quickly left behind.

Incensed, Strahd's talons lengthen and his jaws extend and he rushes Rahadin and begins tearing at the dragon's throat, tearing armored scales away to get to the soft flesh.  the sunlight of the sword burns him, but he ignores it.

Patches pulls out her remaining bombs, puts them on her belt and then darts forwards to engage.    

Gundren fires from cover, but one shot goes wide, the other slams into scales.  He reloads and then fires again, hitting a second time, blasting apart scales with a charged shot.

Strahd begins ripping at Rahadins scales and begins to tear through to the flesh and drink the blood.

Rahadin sucks in a breath, cold collecting and turns his head to kill some targets out of spite.  He targets Cirrus and JmJm, knowing they can't get out of the way and breathes a gale of cold upon them.

Tark sees Rahadin's head swing to his falling friends and he screams in denial as he sees a flicker of the future - Cirrus and JmJm both dying in a blast of cold.  He shadowsteps next to Rahadin's head and smashes his staff down attempting to avert the breath with a stunning strike...but fails to stun the dragon, but unleashes all the pent up Ki in his staff and it cracks bone.

Cirrus and JmJm become visible as the cold breathe clears, both in freefall.  Cirrus is coated in ice, pale but still alive...barely, and plummeting to a certain death.  JmJm...is dead, frozen solid and about to hit the ground with shattering force, ensuring no body to be resurrected... 

the vampires all rush past the down Buumi and lay into Rahadin with their swords, cutting lines of blood as other strikes spark off thick scales.

Rahadin sees Buumi down and picks the Paladin up in his maw and chomps down hard before casting the unconscious form away - not dead, but dying...

Rahadin can barely stand as Strahd draws on his life force and the wounds are mounting.

Danica sees the falling bodies and cant do anything except try and help end the fight and she shoots at rahadin, but misses.

Gibra sees Cirrus falling right by her platform and dives to catch him as he passes, catching a leg and beginning to arrest his fall, but she is pulled over the side.  Thinking quickly, she rolls under the falling Warlock and uses her own body to cushion his fall, breaking ribs and taking a bad fall, but surviving where the warlock would not have.

Rahadin reels back to kill the downed Paladin and Patches flings a knife to try and distract the dragon.  the knife bounces off his armor though, just as Tark slides to Buumi and pours a potion of healing into the downed Paladin's mouth, forcing him to swallow it.

Buumi coughs back to consciousness, his life saved.  Spitting out blood, just in time to roll to the side, getting clipped by the strike from Rahadin as Tark shadowsteps to catch the falling JmJm.

Tark grabs the frozen JmJm from the air and manages to land gently, accepting the fall easily and preventing the body shattering.  Tark notes that JmJm's body is rigid and cold, the eyes glassy and unmoving and lets out a wail of grief as he realizes his friend has died and turns his rage toward the dragon.

The hollows attempt to mob Rahadin but can't touch the creature, several being smashed flat.

Buumi, injured, gets to his feet and prays to helm.  the prayer of healing washes over him, mending bones and closing bite wounds.  He readies the Ashbringer and faces Rahadin.

Gwen pounces onto Rahadin's back and sinks her teeth into his flesh, her claws raking, drawing deep lines of blood.

Rahadin lashes out to bite at Tark, but the monk sees a flicker and dodges, taking a horn rather than being bitten in half.  Tark stumbles, bloody from the hit and barely staying on his feet.

Turn 5

Mordenkainen is on his knees, blistered skin bleeding as he holds the spell together.  He calls out, saying they will arrive any second to the Prime Material.

Ireena yells to Strahd to try and get him to help, but he cannot hear, so far into his bloodlust as he is. she hurls her retrieved spear at Rahadin, but it clatters off his armor so she yells curses at him.

Patches hurls her last fireball earring at Rahadin, instructing the firefly to detonate and catch him on the edge of the blast so that her allies are not incinerated.  She detonates it just as Rahadin reels in pain, clipping his head and wings.

She follows up with a hurled shock bomb, it detonates on his flank in a shower of sparks and flickering lightning, but he shrugs off the detonation.   Calling on her luck blade, she grabs the tip of a wing as it flaps and uses it to launch herself and land on his haunches.  Landing, she uses a climbing anchor to fasten herself into place.

Gundren fires two more shots, but both hit hardened scales doing no damage.

Fey rushes to Cirrus to try and stabilize the warlock.  He calls on some fire magic to warm the tiefling and manages to stabilize the hypothermic warlock.

Ezmerelda grabs Buumi as he dances back from a strike and hand him a potion, veritably pouring it down his throat.

Rahadin is in a frenzy, and spins to loose a final breath...at Tark, Cirrus, Fey and the corpse of JmJm.  Tark sees it coming and screams a warning, they take as much cover as they can but eyes go wide in shock and understanding and the blistering cold washes over them, dropping all of them unconscious save Fey, who managed to create enough of a shield to save himself...but barely. 

Strahd rips Rahadin's throat out and blood fountains, covering the floor.  Rahadin gurgles a roar, dying, but still on his feet.

As the dragon reels, Danica lets loose a final shot...right into the Dragon's eye, the quarrel driving into his brain.  Everything slows as Rahadin reels and slowly falls to the ground, limp.  Blood pours from his hundreds of wounds and the dragon breathes his last.  Rahadin dies, surrounded and covered by enemies.

Healers rush to the downed party members, Herti stabilizes Cirrus, rubbing his frostbitten flesh.  Gibra rushes over and begins doing the same for Tark, getting his blood flowing and stabilizes Tark as well.

The beautiful silver dragon lies death, a huge bloody spray of it's final breath releases and the body goes truly still.

Strahd stands, staring and covered in his friends blood.

from one of Rahadin's ear holes, pours a deluge of blood and the small Atropal that had been living inside him pours forth and begins wailing as it dies.

Patches walks up to the thing and stabs it with Stabby, feeding the cursed blade and utterly killing the Atropal.

A flash of light and a shockwave rips through the castle.  Most are knocked from their feet and as they get up, they see stars and a landscape that is not Barovia.

The group sees a rocky, sandy expanse of desolate desert and the beautiful moon of Faerun surrounded by asteroids.

the castle settles, and some of the outlying pieces of rock drop the thousand feet to the desert floor, the rest still hangs, floating.

The army of the dead circles, languidly and without purpose.

The vampire thralls stand around, confused.

Patches puts her drow cloak away.

Buumi gets down on his knees infront of JmJm and begins praying over the corpse.  After a few moments, he lays his hands on JmJm and the body thaws as it's covered in golden light and brought back to life.

JmJm sits up gasping, remarks on what a rush that was and then flops back to the floor exhausted.  JmJm flops onto the ground and crawls over to the corpse of Waldo and begins to lethargically cast the spell "raise dead" on the corpse.  As he calls the spirit though, he gets a sense of peace and realizes that Waldo is at peace and will not return.

Gundren goes over and gives Cirrus some of the family poultice just as Ezmerelda gives Tark the last potion, healing them both back to consciousness.  Tark then helps JmJm, getting him some water.

Patches rushes back to check on Mordy, just as he exits the chapel, smoking and injured.  He smiles at her and remarks that he will be fine, not to worry about him.  He pulls out a potion and drinks it, beginning to heal his wounds.

Ireena begins talking with Strahd, remarking that they need to do something to atone and get rid of the army of the dead.  Strahd agrees, but not to her idea of self imprisonment.  Strahd remarks that Ireena needs to move on to the halls of Lathander and that he has one final task before he tries to join her in true death.

Tark is glaring at Strahd, blaming and judging him and staggers over to the Vampire.  He tells Strahd to do something about the army of the dead.  Strahd looks at Tark, thinking over the words as Tark says that he will protect his home.  Strahd nods in agreement, saying he will force the army into the sunrise and destroy it as his last act.

The horizon begins to glow with the sunrise mere moments away.

Halos around Patches and Cirrus begin to diminish as the spirits from the swords have finished their tasks and are called back to the afterlife.

Fey analyses the castle chunks and thinks that their floating nature may actually be permanent, despite initial misgivings.  He's so tired though that he's not completely sure.

Every Barovian suddenly cocks their head as if hearing a voice and each is given a choice by the god Lathander, to live a mortal life, or accept the passage of time and be embraced by him and brought to heaven.

Ireena grabs Strahd's hand and the vampire caresses his wifes face.  Strahd closes his eyes and the castle begins to tremble as it disgorges thousands of vampires into the rising sun.  A cacophony of screaming reaches up to the group as the army is burned to ash and embers as the sun rises and the swirling specters are disintegrated.  Strahd begins to smoke as the light rises.

Patches rushes back to the chapel to begin looting, she picks up all the jewelry from the brides and heads further into the Chapel with the Bag of Holding she was given.  She starts wearing the platinum skull mask.  She notes the artifact still floating above the Altar, staring at it, inert.  Gundren wanders over and stares at the artifact from the doorway, trying to analyze it and feel it's emenations but can't get a read on it.  Fey staggers into the Chapel and can tell that the artifact is completely drained and mage hands it and puts it in his bag of holding.

Cirrus says that he's not going anywhere until they confirm Strahd's death.

Buumi sees JmJm alive before flopping onto the ground, exhausted.

Patches, as she passes Morden, asks about the Halos and is told by Stick that the spirits are leaving.  Patches remarks that she's surprised a celestial would waste itself on a Drow.

Mordy staggers to the front of the castle, leaning heavily on Stick. 

Tark plops down next to Buumi and takes a drink from Buumi's flask.  They high five and breath heavily in exhaustion.  Tark asks Buumi what to do about Strahd as he forces the army to die.  Buumi thinks that the truth has made him not a threat.

All the other thralls in the area stride forth into sunbeams and burst into flames.  Strahd is shaking with the effort and turns and begins walking into the sunlight.  Behind him, a breeze wafts through and Ireena crumbles to dust as she accepts the call to move on.  Tears streaming down his face, Strahd makes it to the front of the castle and sits down on the steps, Cirrus following to ensure that he dies.  Strahd turns and looks at Cirrus.  Cirrus remarks that Selune will welcome him, but Strahd has his doubts that any celestial would have him after all he's done, though he hopes Lathander will forgive him.  The shadow aura burns away and Strahd is disintegrated by the rising sun, a massive vortex of shadow exploding from his remains before that too is burned away.  All that remains is a pile of ash, and items.

Patches looks over at Ireena, concern and sadness evident.  Gundren however starts ranting about resource gathering and treasure to be collected, clearly missing the groups sadness as one of their friends and comrades move on from the mortal coil.  Buumi pulls of a gauntlet and hurls it at Gundren, telling him to shut up and read a room.  Fey catches Gundrens eye and acknowledges but makes a hand motion to calm down for now.

Tark lounges in a sunbeam, warmed by the first true sunlight he's seen in weeks.  Patches on the other hand avoids the sunlight and rushes back to the main hall, swearing when she discovers that Strahd is dead, lamenting that she didnt ask him about the loot.

Herti and Gibra look at one another, turn into Ravens and fly off into the sunrise, knowing freedom for the first time in their lives.  Danica shifts into a Raven and flies up through the wreckage to where her kids were kept safe, finding the Leomunds Tiny Hut intact and everyone safe inside.  The survivors of Krezk are nothing but dust, having heeded the call of Lathander.

Kitty and Aurora peer out, two massive Lions huddled with the children hugging their fur.

Chekhov is still there though, but looks up at Danica, greeting her.  Danicas kids rush to her and they hug, the woman crying at the loss of her husband and their freedom from Barovia.

Danica thanks Mr. Pickles and Chekhov for protecting her kids.  Pickles brushes away the thanks, but smiles a little to himself.

Chekhov remembers all his past lives and hearing the call of lathander, turns to dust.  Mr. Pickles goes over and picks out the dagger he and Patches gave him, and chokes back a single tear.  The survivors begin picking their way back to the main hall through the wreckage.  They make it back after about 20 minutes.  Patches asks Mr. Pickles where Chekhov is as she notes his absence.   the goblin tells her that he's gone and holds the knife out to Patches, who takes the knife and remarks that he was a good kid.  Kitty comes up to the upset patches and they hug.  Aurora heads to Buumi to comfort him

Tark remarks that no one will believe their story.  Realising that the Tavern of Doors would now be accessible, Fey goes to open the box and sure enough, it opens easily.

Tark looks out the front door of the castle, seeing an expanse of desert.  Some thirty miles away though are foothills and green - the edge of the desert.  Fey notices and looks himself and recognises the edge of the Silver Marches and notes that Citadel Adbar and Silverymoon are relatively nearby.

Mordenkainen slumps down onto the floor as his wounds continue to knit from his potion.  The group stares at him and Mordy remarks that he needs to sleep for a month.  The group slowly staggers their way into the box and down the stairs for a much needed rest.

Fey remains outside, looking around at the ruins.  Ezmerelda looks around, stunned and at a loss of what to do next.  She starts laughing, realising that her quest is over.  She sobers as she remembers the death of her master, Van Richten.  Fey notes this and remarks that Van Richten went out in a blaze of glory - exactly as he would have wanted, and she agrees. Fey remarks that now the mantle falls to her to carry on his legacy.  They shake hands and she turns to leave, then remarks that she hopes the group has an easy way down the pillar stone rather than climbing...

Tark sits down next to Rahadins corpse in a beam of sunlight and places a hand on his head and begins to meditate on the death of the grand creature and put it to rest.

Gundren and Patches, not in the box yet, begin investigating the the dragon corpse and thinking about what they can do with it.  Gundren falls asleep staring at the corpse, dreaming of Silver dragon scales and massive dragon steaks.  He awakes with a grumble and he and Gwen head into the box to rest properly.

Cirrus stands near the head of the dragon, waiting for people to leave.  He's looking a little twitchy, apologises to Selune, and then begins trying to pull all the dragon teeth.  The teeth are so huge he can't get a single one free before Patches (who was nearby) rushes over and berates the warlock, asking if he should do that.  Cirrus ignores her.  Patches tries to forcibly turn the warlock around and he spins with a small blade and tries to stab Patches.  Patches dodges the strike easily and clocks the Tiefling in the face with a heavy slap, dropping him into unconsciousness... Patches makes a little bed for the warlock, binds his hands and makes him comfortable.

Inside the box Buumi and Gundren stagger in the front door.  A goblin brings them some drinks as they enter the common room, a sight they haven't seen in a long time.  From one of the plushy chairs, a small head pokes up, turning to look at the newcomers.  A little girl, maybe four years old, with cream colored skin, black shimmering hair and green cat-slit eyes looks over them, frowning…
