The group surveys the area, seeing a great many enemies milling around in the crater.  An outer ring of Zombies is spotted, with an inner ring of armored wights.  The group stealthily moves into position to get the best opening assault possible.  Using a large broken building as a staging point, Patches begins to flank the zombies, stealthily killing each she comes across.

Tark sneaks close to two wights and in an attempt to kite them, shurikens one twice, only to have it catch and throw the weapon back at him.  Tark catches it right back, throwing it again only for it to be deflected by the other wight.  The pulsing mass of flesh in the center of the crater lets out a horrible scream and all the undead in the area begin to congregate on the group.  Tark retreats backwards to the main group as Gundren leaps round the corner opening fire at the same moment Buumi flies up out of the ruins and plunges towards the largest undead there - an Atropal Knight.  An armored skeleton, wearing ancient plate and wreathed in dark mist, orange lighted eyes glowing from within a cold black helm.  Buumi strikes the wight in front of him.  Cyrrus, Fey'Anon and JmJm all cast brilliant distracting and debilitating magic, incapacitating most of the undead force.

Buumi meanwhile, takes some vicious hits and is forced to rely on his divine healing to survive.  Patches continues her flanking, killing a third zombie and moving to a nearby ruin.

Buumi is bypassed by the Atropal Knight, and he, a fleshling and Wight engage and surround Tark.  The Atropal sticks out a malformed hand, shooting a line of intense cold, missing Tark by inches and hitting a wight.  Fey'Anon hastes Gundren, who proceeds to slaughter two nearby Zombies, relying on Gwen to do her share.  Cyrrus, hiding in the ruins of the building still, casts several Eldritch blasts, destroying several undead.  Buumi throws his hammer, commanding it to attack the skeletal archers harassing the group from on high.

The Atropal lets out another shriek, shooting two lances of intense cold at the group, hitting powerfully.  Tark, surrounded and taking hits, Shadowsteps directly into the air, drop attacking the Atropal knight and cracking it's skull.  Patches, atop the wall, pulls her ruby earring and throws it at the Atropal, detonating a fireball on it, just as a falling Tark shoots a fireball from his ring at it, and Fey'Anon unleashes his own fiery comet.  The Atropal is slammed by three successive fireballs.  It shrieks in pain, causing damage and exhaustion to the group.  The group begins to mop up the remaining undead.  Cyrrus hops down to Tark and turns him into a giant ape, causing Tark to go on a rampage.  Patches leaps in to attack the Atropal, discovering it's anti-life field and having some of her health sapped away.  Buumi summons Aurora, his mount and charges in, the Artifact protecting him from the anti life field.  The group strikes the Atropal great blows, but each time they do, it lets out a wail and draws upon their life force, hurting them and healing it.  Eventually, the group brings the Atropal to the very brink of death, and as one, deal the most devastating blows they can to the thing.

As they do this, a great scream erupts from Kangaxx in the sky, battling Ysera.  With a flash of orange light, Ysera is knocked from the sky and Kangaxx rockets towards the group at maximum speed, but it is too late.  The Atropal appears to turn to black stone, cracking with orang light emanating from inside.  With a burst of sound like the shattering of a mountain, the Atropal explodes, as does Kangaxx, merely a few dozen feet above the crater.  The group is engulfed in light.

As their eyes adjust, the group finds themselves no longer in the city of Baldurs gate and the ruined plaza of The Morning Lord - Lathander.  They find themselves at a crossroads, at night in the middle of a dark forest, a thick groundfog present.  The sign at the crossroads is mostly scratched out, with the only writing reading "Barovia, 15 miles" and an arrow pointing across the way, in the direction of a slightly ramshackle looking inn.

In the center of the crossroads are the remains of Kangaxx, impacted and embedded in the dirt.  Most of him is gone, and what remains is black and slagged, the edges of the skeleton melted as if wax.  As you watch, bits of the golden skeleton blacken, crack and shatter into tiny flakes and dust.  Kangaxx, the Golden Lich and child of Orcus, is truly destroyed…
