session: 12
summary: "The group assaults the Atropal Knight in the meteor crater, hits it with three simultaneous fireballs, and destroys it just as Kangaxx rockets down from the sky — the lich and the Atropal detonate together, and the group wakes at a crossroads in a dark forest with a sign reading 'Barovia, 15 miles.'"

The crater was ringed with enemies — an outer cordon of zombies surrounding an inner ring of armoured wights, all guarding the pulsing flesh-mass at the centre. The group crept into position. Patches flanked wide, moving through the shadows and silently killing every zombie she encountered.

## The Assault

Tark snuck close to two wights and hurled a shuriken at one. The wight caught it and threw it back. Tark caught it and threw it again. The other wight deflected it. The flesh-mass let out a terrible scream and every undead in the crater began converging on the group.

Tark fell back as Gundren leaped around the corner, opening fire. Buumi flew from the ruins and plunged toward the largest undead — an Atropal Knight, an ancient armoured skeleton wreathed in dark mist, orange light burning from within its cold black helm. Cyrrus, Fëanon, and JmJm unleashed a volley of debilitating magic that incapacitated most of the undead force.

The Atropal Knight bypassed Buumi entirely and surrounded Tark with a fleshling and a wight. It extended a malformed hand and shot a lance of intense cold that missed Tark by inches. Fëanon hasted Gundren, who slaughtered two zombies in seconds while Gwen the lion did her share. Buumi sent his dancing hammer after the skeletal archers on the high ground.

## Three Fireballs

The Atropal shrieked again, shooting twin lances of cold into the group. Tark, surrounded and bleeding, shadow-stepped straight into the air and drop-attacked the Atropal Knight, cracking its skull. In the same heartbeat, three fireballs converged on the creature — Patches detonated her ruby earring, Tark fired his ring mid-fall, and Fëanon unleashed a fiery comet. The Atropal was engulfed in three successive explosions. It shrieked in agony, the sound causing damage and exhaustion to everyone nearby.

The group mopped up the remaining undead. Cyrrus turned Tark into a giant ape, and the monk went on a rampage. Patches leaped in to engage the Atropal but discovered its anti-life field, feeling her vitality drain away. Buumi summoned Aurora and charged in — the golden artifact shielding him from the field's pull. They hammered the Atropal with everything they had, but every blow drew a wail that sapped their life force and healed the creature. Slowly, agonisingly, they brought it to the edge of destruction, and struck together with everything they had left.

## The Death of Kangaxx

High above the city, Kangaxx screamed. A flash of orange light — Ysera was knocked from the sky. The golden lich rocketed toward the crater at impossible speed, but he was too late. The Atropal turned to black stone, cracks of orange light splitting its surface. With a sound like a mountain shattering, the Atropal exploded — and Kangaxx detonated with it, mere dozens of feet above the crater. The group was engulfed in light.

## The Crossroads

When their eyes adjusted, they were no longer in Baldur's Gate. No ruined plaza of Lathander. No burning city. They stood at a crossroads in a dark forest, thick ground fog curling around their feet, night sky above. The signpost was mostly scratched out. Only one line was legible: *Barovia, 15 miles* — with an arrow pointing toward a ramshackle inn across the way.

In the centre of the crossroads lay the remains of Kangaxx, embedded in the dirt. Most of him was gone. What remained was black and slagged, the edges of the golden skeleton melted like wax. As they watched, the last pieces blackened, cracked, and crumbled to dust. Kangaxx, the Golden Lich, Son of Orcus, was truly destroyed.
