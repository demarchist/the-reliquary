*Past this tunnel is a vast cavern lit by the light of lava pools and magma. Many chains, pulleys, and cages hang from the ceiling. Past that you see a dragon, red and crystalline in nature, chained up in front of an ancient titanic forge, being tortured and prodded by a group of cultists in black robes wearing skull masks. The cultists punish the creature and you hear a piercing cry of pain from the dragon as it slumps over: it appears to be too weak to set itself free.*

Buumi and JmJm call out to the cult leader, taunting him and proclaiming that it is in fact the cult who will fail this day!

This buys the rest of the group, and Patches, a few more moments to get into position.

The cult leader discerns the ruse and throws forth a hand, commanding his cultists to fire their lances at Buumi and JmJm.

The battle begins in a volley of fire.

Gundren leaps from cover and begins to unload on the cult leader, blasting away with his own firelance, but the cult leader pulls out a glowing stone and crushes it, giving himself a Shield that deflects some of the shots.

Buumi and JmJm rush forwards, enacting defensive spells

Feanon moves onto a pier of stone, casting haste on Snorbul as the gnome rockets forwards on his broom and then launches into the air, falling directly down onto the cult leader.

Spells and firelance shots begin to fly and the group tries to focus their fire on the Cult Leader.

Many of the cultists crush their own defensive runestones, gaining shields or blurring their forms into obscurity.

Most concerning though, one of the cultists pulls out a bone whistle and blows it just as the Ruby Dragon calls out a warning telepathically; the cult has a horde of Alghouls with them.

The howls and screams of the monstrosities echo throughout the forge and the things begin to climb from cracks, pipes and any other openings, disgorging a half dozen adults and over a dozen hatchlings.

Tark sees this and pulls his own bone whistle from a pouch and blows on it.

The alghouls immediately turn as one and begin to chase the monk save for two already engaged with Buumi, JmJm and Thorna.

Buumi’s hammer begins to glow as he enacts a Blinding Smite and wades into combat swinging.

Feanon sees Tark’s intent in drawing the alghouls to him and contacts him telepathically, “draw them to the edge of the lava”.

JmJm summons a Magical Hand construct and pushes an alghoul adult into the lava, telling Thorna that she can, “thank him later” for coming to her rescue.

As the battle rages, Cirrus summons a radiant celestial and a glowing winged angel-like being with sweeping horns to the battle.

It fires arrow after arrow into the cult leader who tries desperately to get away from Snorbul, Gundren and the celestial.

With the arrival of the celestial the cultists turn their firelances upon it and in a massive volley of fire, the thing is quickly killed.

The cult leader tries to sway some of the group with a charm spell, but Feanon counterspells and the cult leader falls back further to buy time.

Tark, beset on all sides by the slashing Alghouls, shadow-steps up to the Flying Broom Snorbul left in the sky and uses it to reposition to the edge of the arena, 60ft above and then leaps down to the edge of the platform.

Feanon creates a bridge of ice as well as a frame of ice to funnel and protect Tark’s flanks as the horde of Alghouls rush toward him.

Feanon sees his friend about to be in a precarious situation and releases a fireball into the massed enemies.

High above, Patches leaps from the cavern walls, swings on a chain and leaps again, to reach the platform the battle is taking place on.

The heat and light throw her off and she does not judge the distance well, plummeting 90ft to the lower level of the forge, almost landing in the lava, but she manages to save herself at the last second.

Patches sees the following before her*: A large wrought alloy staircase descends into an intricate forge. Channels of bubbling lava wind through the complex, casting dim light over a huge mold chamber and steam vents. The forge sits above a pool of lava supported by massive pipes and adorned in huge angular patterns: both alien and ancient in design, its craft transcends mortal capability. *She rushes for the nearby stairs to head up to the platform the battle is taking place on.

As the alghouls rush Tark, Thorna calls down an ice storm, pummeling and destroying most of the hatchlings and creating difficult terrain.

The cultists continue their barrage of firelance shots, but the Jmjm’s Magical Hand construct flies over and begins to grab and smash at them.

Snorbul swings the final blow to the cult leader, but knows the regenerative powers of the cult. He hacks his head clear from his shoulders to make sure the cult leader stays dead.

Snorbul picks up the head and then teleports (surprising everyone) to Tark’s side to hold the gateway of ice.

Buumi, JmJm, Thorna, Cirrus and Gundren push the main platform, funneling the surviving cultists and alghouls toward Tark and Snorbul, who retreat over the ice bridge toward Feanon.

As the alghouls begin to rush over the ice bridge, Feanon releases the bridge, dispelling it and creates a Singularity instead.

As Snorbul staggers with the end of the Haste, the decapitated head he had been holding utters the words, ”Death is only the beginning” and a long black tongue adorned with gold piercings lashes from the mouth like a python, wrapping around the surprised Snorbul’s arm and begins to constrict.

Snorbul cries out in pain and Corruption begins to spread up his arm from the tongue, making him feel queasy and ill.

The Singularity spell Feanon summons pulls three adult alghouls and several hatchlings near the ice bridge directly over the lava. After the pummeling force of the Singularity spell ends, the creatures fall screaming to a fiery death.

Cirrus sees that several of his companions are badly hurt and begins to throw powerful healing spells their way.

Feanon casts another Disintegrate, taking down another alghoul adult.

Patches makes it to the restrained ruby dragon, pours all her blasting powder into the locks and then blows them with her fire bombs,, breaking the shackles.

The Ruby dragon roars in appreciation and turns to the nearby cultists.

Now freed, the dragon swipes at one cultist, killing them in one fell swoop, and its glittering ruby crystal eyes glow with light as the other cultists' heads explode in a shower of gore.

With the last of the Cult of the Black Skull and their alghouls destroyed, the group stands down, eyeing the massive Ruby Dragon who speaks into their minds:


*“Thank you strangers. You came to me in my time of need and set me free from these … vermin. I am exhausted and wish no harm to you. I assume that you are here for the Forge? Well the heart of it lies below, take the grand staircase down and experience the wonder of the Titans”*

The dragon’s crystals sparkle and it swirls with red, vibrant psionic energy transforming itself into a large male fire genasi, keeping its pitch black scleras and glittering ruby irises. 

After shapeshifting, it begins to walk away from its site of torture, but stops; turning his eyes to the group and focusing on Tark. The dragon moves in and Feanon can feel the dragon's psionics reaching out to read Tark's chi. The dragon walks up to Tark and says:


*“I can sense the aura of a crystal dragon within your chi, little one. Have you met one of my kind before? *
