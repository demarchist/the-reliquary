The battle does not go well for Yenooghu.

The adventurer’s pressure the Gnoll Lord enough that the great Lord bites his own wrist, flinging tar-like blood in front of him and across in an arc.

As the blood splashes down, Hyena’s form from the droplets.

Yeenoghu then swats a Paralyzed Tark from his back and the monk is thrown twenty feet.

The Lord of the Hunt then turns to flee as more shots and spells hammer into the creature.

As Yeenoghu flees, a blast of ice from behind signals the quick end of the band of Hyenas.

Importantly though, the Goristro appears to have awakened from its stupor when it was attacked by three enraged Hyenas.

The Goristro makes quick work of the beasts before turning it’s gaze on the attacking party, the party having moved in to attack it for it’s heart.

As Yeenoghu flees past Patches, the drow darts from the shadows, striking at his knees to throw him off balance.

Yeenoghu crashes through an old ruin wall in an attempt to flee but he stumbles, wounded from the party’s fury and he falters..

He calls back that he will not forget their scents! And then goes invisible...just as Cirrus encapsulates him in a wall of force, trapping the Demon Lord.

Momentarily caught off guard, Yeenoghu begins to cast a teleportation spell to flee the area.

Feanon moves in to counterspell, but unable to see the caster, even knowing he’s within the bubble, he cannot counter the Teleport and Yeenoghu escapes.

The Goristro meanwhile has been battling Buumi, Tark, Patches, Gundren and the others.  It is not faring well.

The beast roars, swatting around itself with massive hairy fists, it’s lank blood-matted fur spattering gore in wide arcs around itself.

The group surrounds the thing, unperturbed.

As they begin to cut it down, the Goristro begins to howl in fear and turns to run, much in the same way as Yeenoghu.

The group clears the area of enemies.

They inspect the area, collecting the Goristro heart, Demon Lord Blood and a pair of Demonic bracers.

Not wanting to be around such bloodshed for fear of it drawing unwanted attention. 

The group heads deeper into the Labyrinth, following Patches until they clear the area.

They then have Tark help them across a chasm and then follow Cirrus as he leads them deeper, using the medallion to guide them.

Before long, they figure they have put enough distance between themselves and the Struggling greater demons.

They begin to search for an appropriate campsite.

Gundren manages to find one before long, but as he begins to tell the group, Patches notices something; Bootprints.

Studying the tracks, the group thinks it may be Dwarves, Surface Dwarves.

The prints are partially obscured by newer minotaur tracks.

Unwilling to run into trouble as tired as they are, the group heads to the Campsite identified by Gundren and set up the Tiny-Hut.

The night is uneventful, though Patches thinks she hears a rhythmic metal pounding sound.

They pick up the trail of the Dwarves and follow.  It heads directly toward the now very audible Metal pounding sound, like a blacksmiths hammer on an anvil.


Patches moves ahead with Tark to scout the tunnel.

A few hours after waking, the group finds the source of the sound and the destination of the Dwarven Boots.

In the center of a smallish cavern, is a large Metal fortification.  

20ft on a side and 50ft at the tip of it’s crenellated roof it is a fortified tower, complete with arrow slits...and attacking force.

Besieging the tower, are a half dozen bloody minotaurs.

Around the tower base though, are dozens of corpses, many looking fairly rotten and pierced with many crossbow bolts - goblins, gnolls and Kobolds.

The group moves in, unwilling to negotiate with bloodthirsty demonic Minotaurs.

Patches hurls a Card from her Deck of illusions, bringing forth a Succubus to distract the stupid beasts.

The group attacks.

Leaping from darkness and firing from the tunnel, the group quickly slaughters the minotaurs, though the leader puts up a better fight than most.

Tark groans at the wounds he suffered from the Minotaur and Cirrus blesses the Monk as Buumi does the same for a bludgeoned Patches.

The minotaurs now dead, the group begins to look around the tower with a closer eye.

It appears that before them is an *Instant Fortress*.

This magical abode also appears to belong to some Surface Dwarves and indeed, as they discern this, a voice calls from the second story arrow slit.

A male, Dwarvish voice calls out, thanking them for killing the minotaurs.

The voice then goes on to ask that they find a way to open the tower, as the only person with the password - The Dwarven Captain, died two weeks back.

The group is naturally suspicious, which only heightens when Patches reports that she sees no movement at the Arrow slit.

She doubts anyone is actually in there.

Having learned that the Underdark is full of Horrors, the group does not trust it one bit.

Tark goes invisible and shadowsteps through an Arrowslit into the interior while Patches scales to the roof of the tower.

Feanon begins to try and discern the password to get the rest of them into the tower.


Inside the dimly lit metal tower, Tark sees nothing out of the ordinary.

The first floor appears to be a coat-room/storage floor and it holds supplies and equipment for four Dwarven miners/explorers.

Good equipment.

Completely untouched in weeks as the dust indicates.

He notes a Dwarven rune etched into the back wall - The Symbol of the Gauntlgrym Kingdom; Delzoun.

Cautious, Tark heads to the nearby metal ladder and ascends to the second floor.

Hopping off the ladder, he looks around at the barracks of the place, seeing two sets of bunkbeds.

Three are occupied by corpses.

Dwarves, dead for weeks lie in their beds, seemingly peacefully.

Tark moves over to one and cannot see any obvious way it died.

A shadow on the other side of the room shifts and Tark comes on alert.

Staring at the darkness, Tark thinks he can make out a shape within.

He sees the shape of a fourth Dwarf, standing in darkened silhouette and looking out the Arrow Slit the voice had come from.

The Shadow Dwarf is staring at Tark. 

It sees him.

Realizing this, Tark becomes visible and greets the creature with “Hi! I’m Tark!”.

The creature hisses out a greeting of “I’m Nabassuu” before lunging at the monk.

The Dwarven body elongates, stretching into a lithe and inkblack figure with batlike wings.

The shadow demon scuttles forward, slashing and biting with fang and claw.

Distressingly, as Tark looks into the darkness, he feels his gaze align with invisible eyes and a tug at his soul.

The demon, this Nabassu, is trying to consume Tark’s very soul.

Outside the tower, the group can hear the sounds of battle.

Feanon manages to discern the password, but not the pronunciation.

Gundren luckily is fluent in the old tongue and rushes to the front door, calling the password up to Patches on the roof and speaking it himself to the door.

The large metal doors swing inwards, silently.

Above, the hatch on the roof lifts and Patches looks down into the tower.

There, she sees Tark battling for his life against a large and dangerous looking Shadow-demon.

Just as she’s about to leap in to attack the thing, a lesser demon leaps from the shadows, forcing Patches to intercept the thing first.

Down below, Cirrus rushes through the door and is instantly attacked by lesser shadow-demons.

With the element of surprise, the things hit surprisingly hard and they steal life force, causing cirrus to stumble in surprise.

With Buumi hot on his heels though and with coverfire from Gundren and Feanon, the now just pissed off Cirrus proceeds to blast the demons to oblivion.

Gundren throws two glorious gemstones from his helmet, bathing the metal tower in sunlight.

The lesser demons are burned away by the light.

Tark appears next to Cirrus, who remarks that he’s looked better.

The badly wounded Tark smiles, drinks the fanciest potion he can find, and then rushes back upstairs, to rejoin Patches as she battles the Greater Demon.

Patches is in a tight spot, but she’s holding her own.

Fighting defensively, Patches manages to stave off any serious wounds until the rest of the group can back her up.

Indeed, they come quickly and Tark rushes in with stunning strikes to give them some breathing room.

Surrounded by the powerful party, the group backs the Greater Demon up into a corner, burning and smashing away at the beast.

Feanon reaches forth and points, a green blast of energy disintegrating the legs of the creature.

It is killed moments later, obliterated by them.

The tower grows quiet, save for the heavy breathing of the group, standing around….nothing, as the dark corpse melts away.


Gundren looks at the group and smiles, “Hey, let’s go lock the door on OUR new Tower!”
