Kangaxx, glowing brightly and hovering above the group, pointed at one of his enemies and uttered an arcane word. The dwarf cleric the group had picked up in the demon woods dropped dead instantly. Kangaxx threw his arms wide and a shower of magic missiles erupted outward, striking everyone present.

## The Cavern Battle

The group formed up quickly, the surviving Drow assisting as best they could while the party hit Kangaxx with everything they had. Tark managed to knock the golden lich out of the air by teleporting above him and dropping from a great height — the impact driving both of them to the ground where the others could strike. Attack after attack landed on the glowing golden form, yet the damage seemed negligible. The Drow stalked in, wary and dazed by the lich's blinding radiance, their leader Lo'Dan still recovering from the initial eruption of light.

Kangaxx unleashed a bolt of lightning into the ceiling, bringing down a massive block of stone that crushed several Drow and destabilized the cavern. Fëanon snatched the artifact shard from the air — it seared his flesh with radiant energy, and he quickly fed it to his frog familiar. Lo'Dan looked on in shock as the frog began to swell, glowing cracks splitting across its skin. Before permanent damage could be done, the frog regurgitated the artifact and Fëanon caught it with a mage hand, tucking it into a pouch.

Tark's stunning strikes broke through the lich's defenses, and the group unleashed their most devastating attacks — doing some damage, but Kangaxx's resilience was staggering. Not until Patches leaped in with The Reaver, its point melting through the golden ribcage, did the lich take true damage. Feeling genuine pain for the first time, Kangaxx broke free of the stunning effects and unleashed a barrage of devastating spells. The remaining Drow warriors were incinerated or badly wounded, and much of the group was left gravely hurt.

## The Artifact

Seeing the exchange between the frog, the artifact, and Lo'Dan, Kangaxx misty-stepped to Fëanon and tried to snatch the pouch. He failed. Growling with frustration, the golden skeleton — now glowing significantly less than minutes before — ripped the artifact pouch from Fëanon with telekinesis.

Preparing to teleport, Kangaxx laughed and struck the ceiling with another lightning bolt. The entire cavern began to shake, rocks raining from above — some massive and deadly. In a flash of light, Kangaxx vanished.

Lo'Dan sprinted to the group, holding out his weapon and demanding they all touch it as an anchor for their escape. Looking up, he spoke to an unseen observer — the Drow psionicist Kimmuriel — and demanded extraction. The world lurched, and the group found themselves on the deck of a ship in the middle of the ocean, in the middle of a storm.

## The Storm

Rain pelted down and thunder boomed across the heaving sea. Across the deck, Kangaxx was slaughtering the crew. With a flurry of chirps, Ysera flew off into the storm, and Tark heard her voice in his mind: *Survive.*

Kangaxx wheeled on the group, exclaiming in rage that following his teleport should not have been possible. Buumi charged forward and attempted to shove the lich overboard, but Kangaxx sidestepped easily. A second later, however, Tark swung in on a rope from the rigging and planted a kick squarely in the lich's chest. The unexpected blow pitched Kangaxx over the rail as the artifact flew from his bony fingers, clattering onto the deck. Tark snatched it up and peered overboard — there was no sign of the golden skeleton, its metal body having sunk into the depths.

## Sailing South

The surviving crew stared in awe at their randomly-appearing saviors. The captain rushed onto the deck, bewildered by the carnage and the strangers, but quickly grasped the situation once it was explained. As thanks for saving his ship, he presented his own enchanted blade — Smoke, a keen cutlass wreathed in ash that obscured its wielder after each swing.

The captain explained they had been bound for Mintarn, but with the crew short-handed and the ship battered by both the storm and Kangaxx, they would have to return to Baldur's Gate. The group could disembark there.

The group took the captain's cabin as their own and settled in for the voyage south.
