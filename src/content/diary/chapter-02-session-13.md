Kangaxx, glowing brightly and floating above the group points at one of his enemies, uttering an arcane word.  The Dwarf cleric the group picked up in the demon woods drops dead instantly.  Kangaxx throws his arms out wide, a shower of magic missiles erupt, striking all present.

The group quickly forms up, the drow assisting as best they can while the party hits Kangaxx with all they've got.  Tark manages to knock the golden lich out of the air and to the ground where he can be attacked by all present, by teleporting above him and dropping down from a great height on him.  Attack after attack hits the glowing golden form, yet little to no damage appears to be done to him.  The Drow stalk in, wary and dazed by the bright lights of the Lich, their leader Lo'Dan still recovering from the eruption of brightness.  Kangaxx unleashes a mighty bolt of lightning into the ceiling, causing a huge block of stone to crush several Drow and destabilizing the cavern.   Fey grabs the artifact from the air, it burns his flesh with radiant energy and he quickly feeds it to his frog familiar.  Lo'Dan looks on in shock and the Frog begins to swell and glowing cracks appear on it's skin.  Before permanent damage can be done, the frog regurgitates the artifact and Fey catches it with a mage hand, putting it into a pouch.

Kangaxx has been stunned by the magical blows of Tark and the group unleashes their most devastating attacks against him - doing some damage, but his resilience is astounding.  Not until Patches leaps in with her dagger, it's point melting through the metal ribcage, does he take true damage.  Feeling hurt for the first time, Kangaxx breaks from the stunning effects and unleashes several devastating spells, incinerating or badly wounding the remaining Drow warriors and gravely wounding many of the group.

Seeing the exchange with the Frog, artifact and Lo'Dan, Kangaxx misty steps to Fey and attempts to snatch the pouch with the artifact unsuccessfully.  Growling with frustration, the animated gold skeleton (now glowing significantly less than a few minutes ago) enacts telekenisis, and simply rips the artifact pouch from Fey. 

Preparing to teleport away, Kangaxx laughs, hitting the ceiling with another lightning bolt.  The entire cavern is now shaking and rocks are raining from above, some huge and deadly.  In a flash of light Kangaxx dissapears.  Lo'Dan runs to the group and holds out his weapon, demanding they all touch it as an anchor for their own escape.  Looking up and speaking to an unknown observer (Kimmuriel, the Drow Psionicist) he demands an escape and the group suddenly finds themselves on the deck of a ship, in the middle of the ocean, in the middle of a storm…

Rain pelting and the wind and thunder booming, the group looks across the deck to see Kangaxx slaughtering the crew.  With a flurry of chirps, Ysera flies of into the storm and Tark hears in his head "survive!".  Kangaxx turns to the group, exclaiming in rage that following his teleport should not have been possible.  Rushing forwards, Buumi attempts to push the Lich overboard, but the Lich easily sidesteps.  A second later though he takes a swinging kick to the chest from Tark who had grabbed a rope from the rigging.  The unexpected attack pitches Kangaxx overboard as the artifact flies from his bony fingers - landing on the deck of the ship.  Tark quickly snatches up the artifact and looks overboard, seeing no sign of the Lich, his metal body having sunk into the depths.

The crew of the ship look on in awe and surprise at their randomly appearing saviors and the rest of the crew, captain included, rush onto the deck confused by the sight in front of them.  Quickly explaining, the group is taken into the captains cabin and thanked for saving the crew from the Golden skeleton.  As a reward for saving the ship, the captain hands over his own enchanted Sword - Smoke, a Keen Smoking Cutlass +2 (crits on 18,19,20.  If used in the previous turn, attacks made against the wielder are made at disadvantage as it creates opaque walls of ash that obscure the wielder).

Then captain explains that  they were headed to Mintarn, but being short handed and the ship being damaged by the storm and Kangaxx, they must return to Baldurs gate where the group can disembark.

The group take the captains cabin as their own and settle down for the night…
