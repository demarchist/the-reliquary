Gundren appears hundreds of feet in the air, flying over the battlefield astride Arkto and begins to blast at one of the Balors, getting her attention

JmJm appears 90ft to one side, flanking both Greater Demons and unleashing the full might of his rings, blasting them with lightning

The lightning washes over the two Drider-Balors, leaving scorches but the two Demons laugh

The rest of the group charges the Demons and begin to strike at them in melee but the blazing heat off the Balors scorches their attackers badly

Both Balors then vanish, teleporting to battle their ranged assailants in melee - one appearing in the air behind JmJm and another jumping twice to get above Gundren

The rest of the battlefield is left far behind and the group looks around for enemies

An invisible Demon teleports behind Tark and Patches ancestor - a massive Marilith demon and it screeches an Abyssal Warcry.

Cirrus confirms it as *The *Marilith, his old “master” and the things strikes with many arms wielding life-stealing swords cutting at all around her

Feanon casts a spell at The demon but her third pair of arms are spellcasting and Counterspells him

Marilith then casts her own spell, which he Counterspells right back, eliciting an annoyed *hiss *from her

Euphoria begins to blast at the Balors and Marilith with Eldritch blasts but the powerful demons seem to take little notice and the Illithid decides to remain in a supporting battlefield role and not get their attention…

Gundren is pressed by the Balor far above the battlefield and the thing focuses its attacks on Arkto, knowing (or hoping) the Dwarf will simply fall to his death should his mount be killed…

Far across the way, JmJm traps his Balor in a Force Cage after dueling the thing for a moment and then gallops away to battle The Marilith but the Balor frees itself moments later offering only a small window for JmJm to slash at the Serpentine Demon with his Inkblade

Cirrus curses at his old master and then shapeshifts, polymorphing into a glowing Planetar or light and shadow, wielding an enchanted greatsword

He rushes at Marilith and strikes at her

Buumi joins the melee, his Nimbus shining with holy light as Patches Ancestor radiates moonlight from her blade

With the shining Planetar and the two holy auras, the battlefield is bathed in radiant light, burning the Demons and strengthening the blows of allies

Far above the battlefield, Arkto is slain and Gundren begins to fall, plummeting hundreds of feet

The Balor lets out a cry of delight, seeing the Mortal plummeting to his demise but is called back to the main Battle by a shout from Marilith and the Balor teleports down to the raucous melee

Marilith is surrounded by powerful foes, but she’s slicing and cutting and stealing the life from the group, closing her wounds almost as fast as they can cause them.

The four arms with swords and the spellcasting pair are a blur of action and reaction, parrying and striking back when attacked.

Patches Ancestor then thrusts her palm forwards and calls forth a prayer to Selune, causing a cone of Radiance to bathe the hilltop, burning the demons and healing the group

Marilith vanishes, going invisible and then teleports away to catch her breath

Cirrus, in his angelic form has Truesight and sees her and gives chase

Just before Gundren hits the ground, he glows with a red aura and simply slows, floating the last few feet to land unharmed at the hilltop, behind the Gleaming Moonfire-enhanced Wall of Force protecting the Drow refugees

The other two Balors entangle the rest of the group in Melee, their fires burning and their lightning swords wounding the heroes.

Feanon is caught up in the serpentine tentacles of one Demon, though Patches ancestor rushes to assist him as Buumi and Tark battle the other

The Balors are badly wounded, covered in radiant burns and oozing cuts, their ichor splatters to the ground, igniting small fires and burning the hilltop. They are no longer laughing. 

Patches and JmJm both see the badly wounded Cirrus Planetar battling something invisible and they rush to join the fray against Marilith
