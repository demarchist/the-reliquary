The group heads into the Critereon and finds themselves in a massive oblong arena.

The stands seat thousands and all look down upon a gladiatorial spectacle.

Down in the sands of the arena, two Chariots are being drawn by feathered Raptor-esque dinosaurs.

In the backs of both, spear wielding and bow wielding gladiators whirl around the arena, stirring up the crowd.

The group settles in to watch the spectacle, ordering drinks and food.

Cages are opened and large spined creatures the size of horses come out.

Two in particular are much larger, their quill-like spines razor sharp and massive.

They seem to be ferocious, snapping at their chains and one gets free, lunging toward the chariots, starting the battle!

The group then watches an exciting bout between the two chariots and the 6 fearsome beasts.

As the battle goes on, half the group heads out to meet up with Liara at the Forum nearby.

The rest stay to witness the rest of the fight and continue to eat.

The chariots end up being the victors, though suffer from some pretty severe looking wounds.

The Gladiators roar in victory and ride off the field.

The stadium crowd begins to get up to leave.

Cirrus looks for an opportunity to pickpocket someone.

The group heads out to go catch up with the others at the Forum.

On the way, they move past the edge of the Guild District - filled with craftsmen.

The evidence of old Saurian architecture is everywhere here, some of the larger buildings being almost completely of the ancient make and design.

They stop in to try and find something for Patches and end up picking up some healing Runestones (and giving them to Cirrus).

They head on to the Forum - the political center of the city and the most impressive structures in the city.

The group stands out here like sore thumbs.

All of the aristocracy here in the forum are wearing some kind of mask to denote station and function.

The group is easily spotted across the plaza by the others and the groups meet up, Liara with them.

Liara informs them that she can get the group tested together in The Crucible - the local Medjay having something to say about “unlicensed” magic used.

Feanon scoffs at the idea, but the group decides they should do this to abide by the local customs.

They head to The Crucible and the headquarters of the Local Medjay garrison.

Once there, Liara heads in to get the test setup.

While she does this, Buumi chats with one of the Medjay officers.

He finds out that they are closest to Paladins and Clerics, they police magic users to prevent wild-magic and protect the local populace as best they can from the horrors of this dying world.

The Crucible is designed as a test to determine how a magic user should be *treated *by the Medjay.

The group heads in to a small Arena, four glowing portals around the edge.

A small set of stands is above where a handful of figures watch.

Liara comes forward and waves to let herself be known amongst the watchers.

The group forms up for battle and signals that they are ready.

Four beasts rush from the glowing portals, grey skin glistening and large dangerous looking fanged maws begin to snap at the group.

The battle is short and bloody, with the strange hound-like creatures letting loose psychic wails.

These wails terrified different members of the group, forcing those unaffected to focus their fire and kill specific beasts.

The group takes a number of hits, Buumi especially, but they manage to slay each of the creatures.

The most significant contribution being Feanon disintegrating two of the things and not causing Wild-magic either time.

When the second beast is disintegrated, the onlookers can be heard whispering and discussing.

The battle over, the group is shown from the arena to a waiting area.

There, the group rests from their combat…
