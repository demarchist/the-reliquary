## Rest Among Ruins

The group split in exhaustion. Tark sat with Rahadin's corpse in a sunbeam, placed a hand on the silver dragon's head, and prayed that the majestic creature find peace. Fëanon made his way upstairs, across cracked stone and floating sections of castle, back to Strahd's study. The fireplace was cold ash. He vaguely recalled a secret passage behind it but was too spent to find anything. He threw open the grand windows in Strahd's bedroom, removed his Alhoon mask, and collapsed onto the ancient four-poster bed. For the first time in a long while, and very much unlike an elf, he slept.

In the main hall, Patches slapped Cyrrus awake. The warlock found his hands bound and apologised for the business with the dragon teeth and the knife. Patches told him bluntly that he appeared to be a weak link in the chain — something she would not tolerate. Cyrrus promised to do better. Patches cut his bonds and walked away. Cyrrus stared at the dragon's gaping maw, felt the urge pulling at him, took a step forward — then froze, eyes closed, and willed himself to stop. He turned and walked to Danica and her children gathered around Urwen's body.

He gave his condolences and removed the magnificent Raven armour, handing it to Danica. She accepted the heirloom of her people with solemn gratitude and donned it. Shifting into the form of a massive raven, her children climbing onto her back, she gently scooped up Urwen's corpse. Ezmerelda waved and called to be picked up too. Snatched in giant talons, the Vistani hunter called out a farewell before her words were lost with the departing bird.

Patches, meanwhile, had been looting with methodical efficiency. She scoured the chapel for vampire jewellery, found an old corpse and stripped it of valuables, then descended to the catacombs. She found Strahd's personal armour and a more advanced pistol with a rotating central cylinder — pocketed for Gundren later. One catacomb radiated ominous cold; she decided to return with Buumi. Hours later, exhaustion finally won and she headed for the Tavern of Doors.

## Cercei

Inside the Tavern, a tense standoff greeted the group. Barthen and Nundro had barricaded themselves from the small girl — who turned out to be the hatched black dragon egg Buumi had received in the Bog. Roughly a year had passed in the Tavern while the group was in Barovia. After her hatching, the dwarves had locked her in a closet, retrieved weapons, and gone back to kill her — only to find the dragon had shifted into the form of a little girl. They could not finish the deed knowing she was Buumi's charge.

Cercei had spent the year as a veritable terror — spoiled, cruel, and capricious. When asked what she did for fun, the girl called over two goblins and made them fight, clapping with glee before the horrified group put a stop to it. Buumi began talking to his new daughter and eventually fell asleep on a plush couch with Cercei curled beside him.

Hours later, Patches returned and was astounded. She took the girl aside, convinced she was manipulating everyone. After a short conversation, Patches realised Cercei was sincere — any manipulation was so fundamental to her nature that it was not an act. She asked if Cercei wanted to learn to fight. The girl spat acid at her. Patches dodged easily and made the little dragon promise to consult before stealing or killing anything.

## The Blue Dragon

Fëanon woke to afternoon sun. On the balcony, he looked across the Anauroch desert toward the green foothills and ice-capped mountains of Luruar. A localised thunderstorm on the desert's edge sparked recognition — a family of blue dragons lived on the border. A winged form sped toward the castle.

He grabbed his mask and staff, cast flight, and leapt over the balcony to warn the others. Back on the main floor, the group had emerged from the Tavern. Cercei's eyes were covered so she could not see the corpses. An azure dragon touched down in the courtyard, then folded into the form of a beautiful high-elf woman in a glittering blue gown. She announced herself as Anaxtrasa and demanded to know what this incursion into her territory was about.

The dragon's arrogance faded as she noted the dead silver dragon behind the group. Her eyes lingered on Mordenkainen; they exchanged a nod of recognition. She noted Cercei — the hatchling clutched her father in fear. After negotiations led by Cyrrus, a deal was struck: three hours to collect whatever they could carry, after which the castle and everything remaining belonged to Anaxtrasa. She would fly them down to the desert floor.

Tark followed the dragon to the courtyard's edge and struck up conversation. Ana was cold and aloof — until Tark mentioned his new nickname: Dragonslayer. The dragon eyed the dangerous little monk, cocked an eyebrow, and returned to surveying the landscape.

## The Haul

Over three hours, the group found Strahd's vault and looted it entirely. In the crypt of Strahd's former lover Patrina, a banshee fled when she realised they were no longer in Barovia, leaving her treasure behind. The Rockseeker brothers systematically harvested everything they could from Rahadin's corpse. With every bag of holding full, the group entered the Tavern of Doors.

Tark picked up the box. Anaxtrasa transformed, scooped the halfling in a talon, and leapt into the sky. Partway down, the blue dragon considered dropping Tark and claiming everything. Tark shadowstepped onto her back as she passed through the Pillarstone's shadow and let out a whoop. The dragon tensed — then decided it was best to let these ones go. She deposited him on the rocky ground and ascended without a word.

## Departures

The group assembled on the desert floor. JmJm turned to them dramatically and announced he was leaving. He had to find Steven — using powerful magic, he had caused the goblin to be reincarnated somewhere in the wider world. The group stared in shock, then exchanged resigned smiles. Hugs and goodbyes were shared. JmJm kicked everyone out of the Tavern of Doors, gave them time to collect supplies, treasure, and the wagon from Phandalin — still pulled by Bart the ox — and sauntered south toward Waterdeep.

Mordenkainen too took his leave. He thanked the group for saving his life and handed Fëanon a sealed scroll tube. He then presented a treasure beyond compare — a potion of longevity brewed by Elminster himself. After a quick discussion, the group decided that Tark, Buumi, Cyrrus, and Gundren should each take a drink, extending their lifespans by twenty years. Mordenkainen said he would replace the lost sending stone and be in touch. Stick said goodbye with his usual glib attitude. They vanished in a flash of light, returning to Oerth.

## The Desert

The wagon rolled out, pulled by Bart and driven by the Rockseekers. Cyrrus sat with Barthen and Nundro, using his spells to smooth the earth before the wheels. Cercei slept in Buumi's arms atop Aurora. Patches and Mr. Pickles rode Kitty. The heavily laden wagon trundles steadily on as the sun set and a cold, clear night descended.

Hours after sundown, Patches spotted a gleam of metal — an ornate brass lamp half-buried in sand. Not thinking much of it, she pocketed it. Several more hours passed before her darkvision picked out a heat plume over a ridge. She and Tark dismounted, wrapped themselves in shadow and stealth, and crested the rise.

Below: a small bandit camp, eight men sleeping around a fire. They had bypassed the outer guards. Patches dispatched the nearest sentry without a sound. Tark found a cage — inside, a dejected woman named Farrah, whose family the bandits had killed. Patches picked the lock. They slipped out through the hole in the watch.

Back at the wagon, Farrah broke down — crying in joy and grief. Fëanon stared at the woman for a moment, dismissed his summoned mount, and marched back toward the camp. Patches, Cyrrus, and Tark followed. From the hilltop, Fëanon extended both hands and summoned a cloudkill that wafted down into the sleeping men. The survivors scrambled up the far slope and stopped short — Fëanon had misty-stepped to block their path. Cyrrus surrounded the mage in blinding light. Black tentacles erupted from the sand, dragging men under. Patches shot the shaking subordinate through the sternum. The leader stood alone, and Fëanon drove the sharp end of his ice staff through the man's chest.

The group gave Farrah two liberated camels and the bandits' coin. She thanked them through tears and turned south to find her tribe. The group settled back in for the long trek to Sundabar. No one mentioned the massacre — or that the darkness of Barovia might still be with them, darkening their hearts.
