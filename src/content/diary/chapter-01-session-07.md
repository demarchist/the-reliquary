The group awoke separated, stripped of their gear, and trapped in a nightmare. No one remembered how they'd gotten there — only that the ground had given way beneath them after a deep mist rolled in and the vegetation withered around them.

## The Refuse Pit

Tark came to at the bottom of a blood-soaked refuse pit, the sound of bone crunching and meat tearing echoing above him. A ghoul perched on the pit's edge was gnawing on fleshy remnants. Tark struck without warning, drowning the creature in the pool of blood. Searching the filth, he found some gold and a pouch of spell reagents before climbing up the sloping tunnel.

## The Butcher's Room

In a rough stone room beyond the tunnel, Gundren was strapped to a massive butcher's table. Bits of meat and severed limbs hung from the ceiling, and old blood covered every surface. Patches lay unconscious in the corner, bound in rope woven from human hair. Gundren couldn't free himself but managed to wake Patches by calling her name. She cut herself loose with a nearby rusty blade, then freed the dwarf. They armed themselves — Patches with knives, Gundren with a massive cleaver — and found a pack containing gold and two scrolls of healing.

The room had three exits: a heavy iron door with a primitive lock, a hallway down which they'd seen a hulking shadow pass, and the refuse chute leading back to Tark's pit.

## Reunion

Lothli and Fëanon awoke suspended from the ceiling of another chamber, hung by human-hair rope above a massive cauldron bubbling with red, meaty froth. Shelves lined the walls, filled with jars of unspeakable contents. Hearing shuffling and guttural noises approaching, Fëanon burned through the rope with magic. Lothli landed nimbly; Fëanon hit the floor hard. Lothli grabbed a bone saw and took cover behind the cauldron.

Two Grimlocks appeared — bloated, mutated, and blind — sniffing the air for prey. At that moment, the iron door swung wide and Patches and Gundren charged through from the other side. Fëanon threw down a patch of magical grease, sending the Grimlocks sprawling. Patches unleashed a barrage of throwing knives as Gundren and Lothli hacked at the prone creatures. Tark arrived from the butcher's room and crushed one's windpipe. The last was chopped apart.

The group compared notes. The last thing any of them remembered was falling through the ground as mist closed in. With no gear, no knowledge of where the rest of the party might be, and only one way forward, they pressed on — but not before searching the room for minor treasure and a healing potion.

## Traps and Horrors

The hallway ahead was riddled with traps and lined with oil lamps. They pocketed several lamps as improvised explosives. A locked door decorated with a spider effigy blocked a staircase leading down. Near the end of the corridor, they found a pulsating fleshy mass attached to the wall. As they approached, it detached and formed into a roughly humanoid abomination of flesh, bone, and teeth. The oil lamps made quick work of it.

Tark suspected the corridor looped back to the butcher's hallway and sprinted ahead to confirm. Rounding a corner, he triggered a lethal trap and was impaled against the ceiling. At the instant of death, he awoke — back in the refuse pit, alive but thoroughly shaken and suffering from short-term insanity. He rejoined the group shortly after.

## The Catacombs

The group entered a large hall — the remnants of an ancient catacomb, with alcoves lining the walls and passages branching in several directions. At the far end stood a statue holding a jewel-encrusted greataxe. Near the entrance, several Grimlocks stood at the edge of a deep pit, fascinated by something far below.

The party ambushed them — Tark used the web bracer to tackle one into the hole and swing to safety with Lothli anchoring the rope, while the rest were pushed or killed and thrown in after. In the catacomb they found a wrought-iron sarcophagus. Taking no chances, they stacked oil lamps around it and detonated them. The mummy within burst forth in flames and was destroyed in its helpless, burning state. Inside the sarcophagus lay a Ring of Regeneration, which Gundren immediately wore.

At the statue, Gundren pulled the greataxe free, causing iron bars to slam down and trap him. He swapped it for his cleaver and the bars retracted. Hidden inside was the first half of a key.

## The Hag

Down a side passage, they found a hulking, monstrously mutated hag. Ambushing her with assassination techniques and a barrage of oil lamps, they brought her down and burned the corpse. On her body they found a healing potion and some jewelry, and nearby was a locked door — its lock matching the half-key they'd recovered.

## The Shrine of Orcus

Continuing deeper, the group found two more rooms. One was entirely engulfed in living flesh; a fleshling pulled itself from the wall and was quickly cut down. In the other, Patches discovered a shrine to Orcus. Two ghouls and a flameskull guarded the entrance, which was trapped. The group lured the undead into their own traps, killing the ghouls and destroying the flameskull.

Inside the shrine, a rusted shortsword sat on the altar. Everyone who touched it was attacked psychically by the cursed weapon. They managed to handle it enough to throw it into a makeshift pack. As they did, they heard the whisperings of Orcus:

> *The Three are walking the material plane once more, preparing for their master.*
