**Deeper into the Sanctum**

**The Grand Hall & The Murals of Magic
**** ** 

The group looks around the grand Hall covered in frost and debris and split apart to inspect the different areas of the room.

Tark and Buumi head to the three smaller doors at the top of the chamber and note that each are encrusted in ice.  So much so that getting through would require smashing the doors, or at least the ice.

Megno and Fey head to one of the murals and begin inspecting while Patches heads to another.

Cirrus sees a smaller open door leading into darkness and decides to investigate, making his familiar (spider) appear and placing it on the door to climb around and into the room.

Meanwhile, Buumi is having a hard time deciphering anything about the Murals and Gundren is busy fixing up Gwen with field repairs.

Over the next several minutes, the group studies the Murals and decides that they must represent the schools of magic. Each mural having a symbol in the center made of precious material that corresponds with one of the slots on the Obelisk at the entrance to the Sanctum.

Patches looks into removing the precious symbols, but gets a stern look from Megno.  Only if the sanctum is actually going to blow up would Megno be ok with defacing the ruin.

Patches sighs and turns from the murals, heading toward the only other door not being investigated - the large set of gold double doors standing ajar.

Tark has wandered over to the Cirrus and the two of them look into the darkened room, Spider leading the way.

They find a long ruined kitchen with a pantry at the back, ancient bones from butchers cuts laying on the ground in a frost covered pile.

A horrible scraping sound pierces the otherwise quiet air and the group spins to see Gwen (at Gundren's command) tearing through the leftmost iced over door.  The ice, and door, is shredded in moments and as it falls a burst of frost cascades over Gwen.

The frost glyph freezes up her gears and Gundren, Tark and Megno pull her back away from the ruined door.

**The Platinum Chest & The Berbalang
 ** 

Back in the main chamber, Patches moves through the double doors, leaping over the threshold she expects to be trapped.

Landing on the other side, and peering further, she sees a T-junction hallway with two large, marble figures at the junction.

Looking behind her, she does indeed see a Glyph trap and calls Fey over to disarm it.

Pushing on, Patches investigates the marble statues.  White marble that stands out against the black granite construction of the place.

Checking them thoroughly, Patches is convinced that they are golems, probably triggered by the Glyph Fey has just destroyed.  She notes the feet are not connected to the base.

The rest of the group filters out of the main hall and into the T-junction hallway Patches is in.

Looking around further, they see two large sets of gold double doors.

Patches moves in to inspect the first and discovers it locked by a mundane lock.  Inspecting it, she determines that it was once enchanted, but the magic and material has corroded over time and she easily picks the lock.

Opening the door, she does not feel the snap of the tripwire until it's too late and a trap is released.

The dart skims Patches hand as she pulls back.  It barely breaks the skin, but it burns a little when it does.

Walking up, Tark asks if she's alright and she nods.

They open the door further and look into the room.

Inside they are greeted with a veritable treasure trove.  Intact bookshelves flank a ruined four poster bed with a glittering, perfect, platinum trunk at the foot.

A frosted set of doors with glass windows can be seen at the far end of the room, light feebly filtering in.

Tark shadowsteps into the room, atop one of the bookcases just as Fey comes up behind Patches and they note Shadows flicking about.

Too late to stop Tark, a living shadow comes out from under the bookcase and attacks him as one comes from under the bed and another out of the corner.

The shadowy claws rake into Tark, but between Fey, Patches and the monk, with the rest of the group hot on their heels, they make quick work of the Shadows.

Turning to the room, they begin to inspect it thoroughly for traps and treasure.

Tark goes and opens the windowed door and after a brief struggle to break through the encrusting ice, the door gives way and a small balcony greets him.

The balcony is in a crevasse on the mountainside and the rock ends twenty feet away, swirling clouds taking their place.

Fey and Megno find fifty intact tomes on the bookshelves, the shelves themselves seemingly enchanted to preserve them.

Gundren and Patches inspect the Platinum chest, but can't decide if it's trapped so move on for now.

Fey moves over to the other bookcase but slips on a small patch of ice.  While on his back though, he looks under the ruined bed and sees a small lockbox and reaches for it.

Patches dashes over and steps on his hand, stopping him.  She then inspects the box and finds it sitting atop a pressure plate.

Looking around the room, she finds a piece of ancient Iron and swaps the small lockbox with it, successfully thwarting the trap.

**Opening the lockbox, they find some truly exotic things: A 1lb bag of Prismeum, a marble of Refined Prismeum, and 2 chits of Glacium. Gundren also manages to scrounge a good deal of gold filigree off of ruined furniture.**

Turning back to the Platinum chest, the group has another crack at it and manage to safely determine that it is not trapped, but is locked with an enchantment.

The magic has faded over time and Fey easily breaks the lock, the lid rising for all to view the contents.

Inside the magnificent chest, they are greeted with quite a sight: **9 spell scrolls, 3 of which are made of solid Gold and capped in shimmering metal, a red silk sash and three books, the last of which appears to be a Spellbook.**

Having thoroughly looted the room, the group laments leaving the magnificent chest behind.  Gundren however, chuckles, and has Gwen shred it with her claws, pocketing the raw materials.

While the group finishes up looting the room, Patches has headed to the other set of doors.

Quickly taking care of a similarly mundane lock, and now expecting a trap, Patches opens the door without incident and peers inside the second room.

Inside it is in a far worse state than the other room, with no furniture surviving save for a lectern.

Surprisingly though, a creature is at the lectern, reading a book.

Looking very much like an oversized imp, the creature is hunched over the book, flipping through pages.  Its wings folded on its back as it reaches out with gangly arms and looks on with large eyes peering from an elongated head.

Patches throws a flash bomb at its feet.

It cries in pain as its blinded and Patches rushes forward with her tripwires and hogties the poor creature.

The rest of the group rushes in just in time to see Patches finishing her knots.

The creature is furious and begins talking and swearing at the group, introducing itself as Mervklo.

During its ramblings, it mentions a "Dream Orb" which the group determine to be a Beholder and "the others" the group takes to be the ghosts of the people who once lived here.

There is a Beholder in the dungeon responsible for dreaming the smaller Beholder-kin into existence.

They determine that Mervklo came from the Astral plane and is here looking for secrets and that it had been studying the book for two weeks without any luck.

The group looks at the book and though it is written in Netherese, they see text, unlike the creature.

This really annoys the thing and it stops talking to anyone.

The group doesn’t want to murder Mervklo, but neither do they want to leave any potential enemies behind them so they keep him hogtied and put him on a Tenser's floating disk to take with them.

They investigate the room quickly but only find a few small obsidian figurines.
  

**The Mold
**** ** 

Heading back through the Grand hall, the group approaches the Iced over doors, Mervklo in tow on the Tenser's disk.

Approaching the door that Gwen previously shredded, they feel intense cold emanating from the opening.

Tark looks through the door and manages to spot the cause - a massive patch of Brown Mold.

Remembering their adventuring training, the group remembers that intense cold damage will kill off Brown Mold and Megno begins using his ray of frost to clear a path through the Mold.

Clearing a path, Cirrus moves into position, and with a thump of his staff on the floor, casts Cone of Cold down the whole hallway.

The Brown Mold is annihilated by the gale of frost and the hallway glitters with a thicker coating of ice.

Already near one of the larger doors, Patches moves in to inspect and unlock the door.

The lock clicks and she opens the door a crack to peer through…and immediately closes it and turns around, her eyes wide.

She tells the group what she glimpsed - a floating head with ten tendrils, each ending with an Eye and a great orb in the middle of the floating head above a toothy maw…
  

**The Beholder & The Gauth
**** ** 

The group weighs their options. A Beholder is a fearsome enemy.

Moments tick by and nothing happens.  Patches relays that she saw some kind of silver light inside but does not know what that means.

Cirrus decides to go in and talk with the creature, Buumi acting as a bodyguard and the rest of the group just on the other side of the door.

Buumi opens the door and steps inside, Cirrus close behind.

They don't immediately get incinerated by magic and indeed, the creature simply watches for a moment, allowing Cirrus to begin a dialogue.

After a few moments taking in the situation, Cirrus realizes that the creature is actually trapped within a beautifully constructed Magic Circle, and that it would require help to be freed.

Wondering what would happen, they then bring Mervklo in on the disc.  The moment the Beholder's gaze falls on Mervklo and the disc though, both flash out of existence as the magical constructs both are dispelled.

The group finds this odd…but keeps going.

Noting their good fortune, the group decides to look around the room, finding some small baubles and then leave.  Closing the door behind them on the utterly infuriated Beholder as it swears to consume them, flay them and other nasty things.

Turning to the rest of the long hallway, the group sees three smaller doors opposite the ice encrusted ones, and another set of golden double doors opposite them.

They opt to check the smaller doors first.

The first room they check is small, little more than an acolyte's dorm room, the furniture utterly destroyed.  They do find a small brass pot with a very faint emanation of magic. Inspecting the pot, the realize that it's a magical chamber-pot that once would have removed waste via magic.  The group takes it, thinking that reverse engineering it could be useful.

Moving on to the next door, they notice that the door jam is cracked and the ceiling is actually being supported by the door.  Gundren confirms that opening the door will result in the room caving in, but luckily not the hall.

Gundren has Gwen claw a small hole in the door, large enough to look inside.  The door groans in protest.

Peering into the room, they see another small chamber, the furniture in ruins and a magnificent Greataxe gleaming amongst the refuse.

Tark shadowsteps through the hole and grabs the axe.  Just then, the door gives way, crumpling and the ceiling begins to cave in.

Tark dodges nimbly around a few falling blocks and then shadowsteps out into the hall just as the cave in fills the small room.

Breathing heavily and now covered in stone dust, Tark holds up the magnificent axe.

The Axe has a diamond shaped head, a long haft made of carved Ivory and a blue, silk-wrapped handle with a flowing cord.

Placing the axe in a Bag of Holding, the group moves on to the final door and Patches moves in to unlock it and inspect it.

She opens the door a crack, and sees a floating head with writhing eye-ball covered tentacles and closes the door again instantly.

Another Beholder.

The group discusses rushing in and killing it, but decide to get some more information first.

Cirrus returns to the other beholder and begins telling it that they met the other and it's far superior.  This causes the trapped beholder to become incensed, screaming that the other one is just a Gauth and not a true beholder.  Cirrus then just leaves with the information.

Returning to the group, they decide not to bother tangling with the creature and lock the door with an arcane ward, deciding to simply trap the Gauth inside.  For good measure, they place an alarm spell on the door.

The group turns to the final set of doors they have yet to investigate and Patches does her thing.

Opening the doors, she sees some red cloth and decides to head in to investigate, mindful of traps or ambush.  Indeed, as she moves in, she spots some movement and sees shadows flicking about the edges of the room.

Patches carefully removes the Red garment from under a pile of debris, and leaves the chamber, a magnificent set of robes in hand.  They stow the robes and then head back to the T-junction with the Golems from earlier.
  

**The Ghost of Thesia
 ** 

Heading back to the Marble statues, the group investigates the wall between them and as they suspected, they find a small button that opens the wall.

Before them rises a staircase made of dark stone and it ascends to a landing only barely visible from where they stand.

The group heads up the stairs, to the landing, but fail to notice a Glyph trap.

Patches and Gundren are the first onto the landing, and as they step up, a Marble statue steps from it's plinth and swings a stone fist directly at the Rogue.

The group piles in around the construct, Tark shadowstepping above it and landing a solid blow on the thing before darting away.

The group focuses their fire and the Golem is dismantled in moments, but not before it manages to get in several powerful hits.

Continuing up the stairs, the group finds another landing, but manage to find the Glyph and destroy it before moving past the Golem there.

Now on the second floor, the group is greeted with an oddly shaped room.  A hallway extends in front of them with two doors opposite one another and a third door further in.  Opposite the third door though, the room opens up and from the stairs, the group can just make out debris and detritus.

Carefully moving forwards, they check the first room on the left, but it has caved in so they check the other door and find it unlocked.

Opening it, Fey looks inside and sees the spectral form of a woman crying over destroyed and ancient lab equipment.

Fey moves in to talk to the Ghost and it spins as he addresses her, calling out in Netherese and then disappearing.

Fey then turns and bolts out of the room, running deeper into the complex.

In the main room, the group looks over and spot a huge marble statue with four arms in an alcove.  They figure that it is most likely a Golem…

Tark sees Fey running and saw the strange exchange with the ghost and assumes the worst.  Tark tackles Fey to the ground.

Fey twists and looks at Tark and the ghost flashes from possessing Fey, to inhabiting Tark.

The possessed Tark then stands and sprints further ahead, Patches hot on his heels though.

Just as Tark rounds the corner, heading toward a large spiral staircase, Patches trips and then tackles the Monk, restraining him from behind.

Tark begins babbling in Netherese as Buumi rushes to follow, the paladin plowing through an explosion of fire as he accidentally sets off a glyph.  Buumi stumbles out the other side a little red and burnt, but otherwise unhurt and rushes to his friend to free him of possession.
  

**Promethi Arrives
 ** 

Just as Buumi and the other group members rush to help their friend, a ghostly form appears out of the darkness in the room behind them.  All twisting shadow and tattered robes, the specter looks over the group, hatred radiating from undead creature.

The Specter shimmers and splits into four images of itself and with a slithering whisper remarks "Excellent…guests…"
