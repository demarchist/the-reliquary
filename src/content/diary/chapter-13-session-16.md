The group returns to the Gate Room of the Golden Tower 

There lies the disassembled Ringed Veil from the Machina Factory 

Gundren and Feanon immediately move to investigate the gate and begin to check all of its inner workings.

*Something *about the gate’s workings seems wrong, but neither can put their finger on it, until they notice a great number of pure-sapphire circuits.  

Metal transmuted into gemstone it seems, and possibly a new addition?

Odd, but also the group has not had enough experience to know for sure if the Sapphire Circuits are bad.

They continue their inspection, confident that something is wrong, but unable to pinpoint something.

Cirrus begins to berate them and play “manager”.

He “helps”

Several of the group decide to head into the city, as they are useless with the arcane.

Jareem arrives on the Gate-Room floor of the tower with the throne and dais, having sensed the group enter the tower a few minutes ago.

He greets them and welcomes them to *his *tower

He is wearing the Turban of Control

But hearing “*his” *tower, rubs the group the wrong way

Jareem looks to the disassembled gate and grumbles about risks, warning the group not to be hasty and take unnecessary chances.

The group thinks that for a Dragon they had to rescue from certain death, he’s dishing out a lot of unwanted advice…

Still though, they settle down and Jareem goes on to say that he and Doc B have been working in the City with Bashir

Seeing the group is busy dealing with the Ringed Veil, he returns to his meditations in his Lair below.

The group thinks his behavior a bit…abrasive compared to before, but it is pointed out that he is a Dragon, with a new lair.  It’s Instinct and we shouldn't take it too personally.

Patches wishes to go to the city with the others, but having recently spent a lot of time with **Hasrala **the Saurian spirit in the Machina body, she has some knowledge of the workings of the Veils.

She spends some time sketching what she remembered of the Gate technology and then hands it to Feanon and looks inside one of the Radii.

She asks Feanon and Gundren how many of the Sapphire Circuits were in here

5 they say.

She says she now sees none

Gundren and Feanon rush over to check, and indeed, there are no Sapphire Circuits

Racing back along the debugging path, Gundren sees a number of the Sapphire circuits gone - replaced with regular looking metal, crystal and arcane housings.

Then, before his eyes, there's a small flash and one of the circuits changes.

He points it out to Feanon, who tries to get an arcane sense of what just happened.

It is strikingly similar magic to that of an *Instant Summons *spell.

As they watch, another circuit changes

They don't know what to do…should they stop this change, is this change normal? 

They just don’t know…

Meanwhile, the rest of the group - Tark, Buumi, Patches and JmJm leave the Tower to head into the city.

As they move through the Hallway of Fulmination, the great Brass doors of the tower swing in silently, revealing the windswept bridge leading from the Golden Tower, to the Palace of the city.

The brown expanse of the city sprawls beneath, in the shadow of the Palace Complex.

Starting fifty feet away, and then spaced every fifty feet, are pairs of guards.

The group looks at one another, a little unsure what the guards may entail

As they move forwards to investigate, a figure pulls itself over the nearby stone railing of the bridge and moves to slip inside the Golden Tower as the doors begin to close

Patches spins and grabs the figure, pulling it to a stop and whipping out a dagger

She places it against the hooded figure’s throat and there is a clink of metal

Looking under the hood, she sees the Machina face of **Hasrala the Saurian**

The group gathers around, questioning the Machina Saurian they have not seen in weeks

The nearby City Guard head across the bridge to investigate the commotion as a figure appearing on a bridge 400ft above the city is…concerning

They placate the guards and ask that Bashir come to see them.

The guards say that they will relay the message, but the Sultan will be summoning *them*

The group laughs and turns to lead Hasrala into the Golden Tower

They take the Saurian up to the Gate and the rest of the group

Gundren and Feanon have Hasrala look at the gate.

He confirms that the Sapphire circuits are abnormal and that when replaced, the circuit is different than it should be.

The change is so subtle though, that he cannot be sure what or why it is being changed

Confident that this is abnormal and should be stopped, Feanon begins to Counterspell any other Circuit change while the rest of the group works on dispelling the sapphire circuits.

Gundren meanwhile works with Hasrala to go through all the scrap they hauled out of the Machina factory and begins to strip the parts and replace any and all Sapphire Circuits or changed circuits that they can find.

Its going to take *hours*

The city-expedition group leaves them to their work and heads back out of the tower.

Along the bridge, the guards have been joined by servants carrying platters of food and drink.

Enticed, the group moves forward, partaking of the gifts and being led across the bridge by them

At the far end of the bridge, Bashir steps out of the shade, smiling, and thanks the group for coming to see him.

(tabletalk) *the group groans*

They talk and Bashir tells them what’s been happening about the city.

Djoser and the Wardens have secured the Spelljammer and are fortifying it

Doc has been assisting around the city, which now has bountiful food being handed out to the citizens

The Plague is under control and diminished

The group thanks Bashir and moves to begin their descent to the city proper and Bashir interrupts them

He asks if the group would remain in the Palace for the time being and that anything they need can be brought to them.

Patches provides a list of what she needs for her Alchemy and Buumi puts in a request for supplies.

Bashir agrees

The group then ignores his request to stay out of the city and they descend the great palace stair to the Noble District and Artisan District below.

Bashir looks a little unhappy, but does not stop them.

Dressed in local clothing, and without Cirrus, The Outlanders blend in much better than their last visit.  Even so, some heads do turn and they hear the whispers of “outlanders”

As they move through the districts, heading for a good Tavern on the Docks, they hear other whispers and murmurings in the Upper-class areas.

There seems to be quite a bit of grumbling about Bashir giving out so much food to the poors

This seems to be upsetting the power balance in the city

The group moves past the great Pyramid of Rudjek, an evil stain on the city.  It is noticibly colder near the edifice.

As the group transitions to the poorer sections of the city, they begin to notice Wardens handing out bread and other food to the masses and everyone they pass seems to be holding some kind of food

No one is going hungry it seems, and the people here seem thrilled about it

Making it to the docks, the group looks around and finds dozens of taverns that may fit their needs.

They cant decide until they see someone get bodily thrown from one and they all pick that tavern without a word.

As Tark passes a sailor carrying a fine coil of rope, Take buys it from the man - handing him many times what the rope is worth.

It’s a *fine *coil though

The group enters their Tavern of Choice - a nameless place it seems though with a large sign depicting a Centipede monster eating someone

As they enter, all eyes turn to the group and a few whispers of “outlanders” go through the place.

The bard in the corner of the tavern resumes playing quickly and the place resumes its normal cadence

The group sits at a nearby table and they begin to order some drinks and food

JmJm tries to Mage hand the Bard’s Lute, but the Bard snatches it back

Things are tense for a moment, but JmJm just begins his performance and the Bard assumes that it was an attempt to get him to play along.

JmJm is *amazing *so the Bard decides to do just that, and begins to accompany JmJm

He does such a good job that JmJm’s food and drink is free and the aspiring Bard in the corner gets some good tips

Tark scans the room and spots a group of mercenaries that look capable.

He and JmJm approach the group and before long everyone is talking

The group is led by the Barbarian **Coho, but his underling Gon is most intriguing**

Tark offers them a job and at first the group is adamant they wouldnt dare enter the Pyramid of Rudjek and refuse

But after some talking and persuading, they manage to change their minds 

They are hired by Tark to secure the Pyramid of Rudjek using Outlander Weapons and items.

**Coho **will come back to the Barony to get supplies and Gon will take his group to secure a beachhead in the dungeon of Rudjek.

Satisfied, Tark and his friends return to their table to finish their dinners, before leaving the Tavern and returning to The Golden Tower.

On the way, they see more food and many of the city Wardens.

Patches then tells the group she overheard in the Tavern that Bashir is bypassing the nobles with this food and getting favor with the peasants at the expense of the nobles.

The group briefly wonders if Jareem is fattening up the city, but no, its just Bashir taking care of his people….they think…

They purchase some Khonsfa saddles for their beetles back at the Tower.

They are pricey, but the group manages to get a 2 for 1 deal from JmJm’s Silver Tongue

But no one has any money on them except for Patches, who sighs and pays the man.

The group makes it back to the tower without incident where they discuss their immediate plans

Cirrus re-iterates his proposed plan of killing Fawden and depriving Vecna of her power

There’s some extra discussion about motivation where some things are NOT said

They decide to take the Gate to the Font of Fawden to kill her.

Tark is unsure and wants to just leave, but Cirrus makes a compelling case for depriving Zalaam/Vecna of her power as letting him take it would be really, really bad.

Cirrus visits Feanon’s chamber and tells him the full plan - bringing Selune into this world.

The Wizard agrees to help

Cirrus moves out onto the Balcony and begins to yodle his prayer, which is answered by many other voices throughout the city.

One by one, he out-yodles them, until only his voice remains.  

He persists until he can yodle no more…
