The group stays in svartalfheim for a few days.

While there, Patches meditates in the gardens and spends time with Finn.

While there she questions a gardener about where to perform martial arts, she is told: in The House of the Weaponmasters

Cirrus goes shopping, having a custom robe of moonweave crafted for him, he traded a Philter of love for it.

Tark went shopping with Cirrus and tried to find monster parts for the Windrunner armor but could not find any.

He was given a lead to talk to The Hunters in the city.

Feanon went looking for the most ancient library and ended up finding out that it belongs to the oldest Dark Elf Clan in Dokkar - The Tinnaveddir.

He crafts a letter of introduction and hands it to the Clan Guards, starting the process.

Buumi spends his time in the gardens, soaking the place in.

Eventually, the group is called back to Magistrate Delroy where he informs Patches that the elders have made a decision.

Due to Finn’s threatened nature and inability to defend himself, he can remain in the city of Dokkar, bound to the first two levels of the city.

Patches meanwhile, is tasked of ridding the Curse of Wendonai from her blood if she wishes to come back to the city for any length of time or ascend to the higher tiers of the city.

Patches agrees and is told cryptically that she should look at ancient history for a lead, from before the Crown Wars.

The group then planeshifts back to the Barony, ending their Cirruscation.


Meanwhile, back at the Barony, Gundren has been busy.

Deciding not to go to Svartalfheim, the Dwarf instead went to a local Flyting competition with his entourage.

Whilst there, Gundren received word of a grisly murder back in the village of Kossenberg, within the Barony.

Gundren returns to the Barony with haste.

In Patches establishment, Snorbul has returned from an ill-fated trip to Icewind dale.

Upon making the northern pass, he and his caravan found the way blocked by a massive wall of ice.

Thorna remained, refusing to leave the base of the great wall and Snorbul has now returned to the Barony, partly to tell the group of what he saw.

As Snorbul entered the Establishment, he was drawn to a table seating his cousin, Hemeth the Duergar and Veygar the Duergar.

Veygar says that his cousin has sent word that the way to The Labyrinth is clear once more.

If the group wishes, they can head back to the Underdark, to the next lead for a Fragment of the Word.

As Snorbul receives this information, Word of the murder reaches the town and Snorbul opts to go and investigate.

On the road, he runs into Gundren and the two of them head to Kossenberg to investigate.

Arriving, they find the gruesome sight of a mangled corpse, their chest ripped open and organs devoured.

Investigating the scene, they determine that the man was ripped open from the inside by some creature and that the woman nearby has one such thing gestating in her.

Snorbul rushes to the druids grove and collects Doc B.

Rushing back, they manage to cure the woman just in time and she vomits up a tadpole like creature.

A Slaad tadpole.

The rest of the group teleports back from Svartalfheim and are made aware of the situation.

They meet up with Snorbul and Gundren as they are out hunting the growing Slaad.

As they hunt, they find one other corpse torn open.

For the next twelve hours, the forces of the barony scour the land, finding and killing the massive Blue Slaad spawned from the infected villagers.

8 other refugees are found and cured of the affliction.

Feanon takes three corpses back to the tower and later finds its Control Gem amongst the brain-matter.

The group, having dealt with the last of the immediate fallout from Menzoberranzan, take a well earned break.

For the next several days, everyone relaxes, taking care of business around the Barony.

Gundren catches up on his information network 

He finds several promising leads have been investigated -

This leads to him choosing the Efreeti Chain to pursue at the Siege of Scornubel.

Feanon conducts experiments on the dead Slaad and finishes another Distortion spell, rounding out his repertoire.

He also prepares for the impending visit by Lady Avelyere of the Netherese.

Patches gets her Aurora cloak fitted for the Ball and then deals with the arriving nobles needing accommodation.

She also meets with Veygar where he tells her he’s ready to take them back to the Underdark.

He asks to merge crews with her, as Patches as the leader and with himself as her #2.

She’s lukewarm on the offer.

She’s more open to him as a Subcontractor

He says he’ll think about it.

Cirrus visits his followers and subjects around the Barony, reassuring them and glowing occasionally.

Cirrus notes a few shiny new limbs on his followers, he likes the shine.

He preems himself for the upcoming Ball and does a lot of preaching.

Tark is very wrapped up in Snail Training his snail; Stripes.

Nobles and members of high society begin to arrive for the ball over the next few days.

Including Lady Faye, Lady Avelyere, Anaxtrasa and more.

Lady Avelyere arrives in an ornate black carriage and is flanked by two Shadowmonk bodyguards.

Feanon meets her with his entire mage enclave in the town square, intentionally getting there before Cirrus.

She looks over Feanon’s looted Netherese artefacts with disapproval and takes her leave to get settled in her rooms for her stay.

Later though, she heads to Feanon’s tower for a tour.

Patches Establishment is raking in the dough during this event.  After expenses, the Establishment nets about 2,000gp.

Lady Avelyere heads out to tour Feanon’s tower, he explains his whole operation and she approves and is impressed by his setup.

She sits and talks with Feanon, reiterating the Netherese drive to reclaim their lost cultural artefacts.

She expresses an interest in acquiring the Iron Tome and Feanons Robes but is rebuffed.

She tries a different tactic in that the Netherese can recoup the artefacts on his natural death.  He says he will consider a contract for that eventuality. 

She also offers that Netherese nobles to come and patronize the barony establishment and auction house and that her Coven would personally acquire any other Netherese artefacts from the group.

Feanon agrees to this part of the deal. 

He begins to slide the conversation over the next few days in the direction of Mythallars. Careful not to lead on that he has one of the powerful devices in an unfinished state.

Cirrus has drinks with Lady Avelyere and rubs it in Feanon’s face.

Tark meets with one of the Shadowmonks and spars with him.

Tark defeats the man easily and learns that the Netherese have at least one monastery of monks and they are Shadow monks.

Tark is invited to **Shade Enclave**, near **Myth Drannor** to see the **Way of the Pointed Step** and meet with **Master Jorell, a Vampire who supposedly never needs to feed.** 

Patches meets with Lady Faye and negotiates to be released from the Zhentarim.  Lady Faye is eager for outside allies and allows it with Patches swearing friendship and partnership in future endeavors.

Lady F also notes that her Husband, Lord Huffelbram is dying of Gout and similar diseases and insinuates that she may even be expediting matters.

She also mentions good trade relations between her own House and Bregan D’Aerthe.

Snorbul sets up a fighting pit during the ball and snags three unfortunate young aristocrats.

They end up fighting for their lives in the pits against a ferocious Flail-Snail.

Once the first kid goes down and Snorbul realizes how outmatched they are, he jumps in and ends the fight, recapturing the snail and having the kids taken to healers.

The Debutant Ball finally arrives and over the course of the evening, the Keep is infiltrated and attacked by thieves.

With the Ball being ruined after JmJm’s big production of Curse of Strahd, the night ends in a bit of chaos and with the guards locking down the barony.

Several of the thieves are captured, several are killed and some ended up turning on their compatriots and are even released by the group.

Following the botched Ball, Cirrus is furious and Gundren and Patches are both sending spies and scouts out to find out who is responsible.

They get the names Lennok with a strange carriage and a shapeshifting gnome.

Following the ball, Patches spies Buumi’s potential betrothed - **WIllow Aldencroft** and spies on her.

Patches notes that the woman appears to be quite competent - well armed and prepared for danger.

There is something under the surface, but Patches cannot quite determine what it is.

She finds herself not completely despising the woman.


Cirrus encounters the strange yellowskinned and bald woman he had seen the night before at the ball, but it ignored by her.

This enrages him.

He tries to follow nonchalantly but she notices and doubles back, forcing Cirrus to continue on into town from his Fane.

This strange woman is now dead to him.

Cleric Temura apologizes for the lady and swears that he will have the woman reprimanded.

Cirrus meets with Patches in the Establishment and vents about the disgrace of the ball.

Patches mentions she tracked one raged out Dwarf into the sewer and found more corpses.

Patches relays what she’s learned to Cirrus and that the names have gone out to the network, they *will *find who did this.
