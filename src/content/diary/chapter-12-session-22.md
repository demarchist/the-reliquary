The group awakes on the side of the great volcano

Despite the altitude, the heat of the place kept it comfortable at night and they slept surprisingly well

Except for Feanon

He rises from his reverie, shaking and vomiting black tar and blood

Feanon realizes that this is a magical malady and could be fatal

In the morning routine, the group notices that something is amiss with the Wizard

Concerned, the group gathers to see their friend.

As bad as the first symptoms were though, they abate somewhat and he manages to shake off the group’s concerns…for now

If his condition worsens, Cirrus will cast an immediate Greater Restoration on the Wizard.

The Dragon stares at the Wizard

Mollified for now, the group continues with their breakfast and then break camp

The Dragon ferries them back into the Caldera of the volcano, his weight halved by Feanon

They descend through a cloud of caustic fumes and ash, forcing everyone to cover their faces

Gundren puts on a gas-mask

Below the volcanic clouds, the group can see the Molten City Ruins stretch out before them amongst the glowing fields of lava.

In one area, where the magma has receded recently, a large domed structure sits atop a pillar of stone

The pillar juts out of the Magma lake, with only two small bridges connecting from the mainland to the Temple of Vaketh perched atop it

The group gets as close as they dare to the Temple, landing on the other side of one of the narrow bridges.

The Dragon shapeshifts down into his Genasi form, saying that he *can *exert himself magically, but it would be a psionic beacon to Zalaam and would likely draw undue attention.

For now, he goes low-key.

The group agrees on a plan and they sneak closer to the temple for a better look

The heat though is terrible and Buumi begins to get quite exhausted and Feanon’s sickness begins to drain on the wizard.

With Pass Without Trace and their favorite Drow back in the scout role though, the group pushes across the precariously thin bridge

They get within shooting distance for Gundren to properly support and then take a good look.

The temple has numerous “hound”-like creatures patrolling the area, *Howlers*, we had fought before in the Crucible of Ras Alkan. Shadowfell creatures.

A number of strange looking, angular specters can also be seen floating around the exterior.

The place is also riddled with dark corruption and a storm of wild-magic sparks overhead.

The group moves in, intent on sneaking inside with their veiling magics, but as they near the temple, two of the specters turn their heads toward the group and wail.

The nearby Howlers let out snorts and then begin to head over to where the wailing specters are now pointing.

The fight is on.

The group bursts from their hiding places and attack the approaching Howlers and ghostly specters.

As one of the specters nears the group on the bridge, it wails again, a far more sinister and deadly blast.

These are Banshees.

Spirits of long dead Elves.

The group moves to destroy the deadly things first while Buumi, Tark and Snorbul hold the bridge against the howlers and toss them into the lava if they get too close.

Cirrus decides to put an end to the battle quickly, and summons a sickening radiance at the junction of bridge and temple.

This forces the creatures into the radiance if they wish to approach the group

Feanon then enacts a telekinesis spell and drags the banshees back into the radiance if they move away.

The last few Howlers are slain by being shot by Gundren, or pushed into the Lava and the group cautiously moves up.

Moments go by, just long enough for Tark to shadowstep ahead, when the Wild Magic Storm surges and a set of rifts appear, depositing a large number of creatures.

Several Lonely, and more Banshees appear in the temple vicinity.

As Tark looks around, confused and feeling very alone surrounded by enemies, he looks straight up.

In the air, inside the dome of the temple, is a storm of energies, he leaps to hide up in there.

Inside the storm though, he finds a glyph floating at the epicenter, a rift.

Tark sticks his head through and witnesses a flash of the other side

Tark sees a desolate landscape, the sky covered in dark stormclouds and rumbling with thunder. He looks around; It appears to be a ruined city but as far as he can see, are rank after rank of undead, all wielding ancient weapons and armor.  Many are clearly human or human-like.  But many are taller, more lithe and have a serpentine cast to their skeletons.  Great dark forms wheel overhead and a terrifying cacophony of shrieking can heard echoing across the ruins. It smells of dust, mold and old blood.  Directly in front of the portal and glyph, stands a resplendent figure, flanked by dark creatures against a backdrop of a massive obsidian pyramid.  Just as Tark is yanked back through the portal, he sees this Serpentine figure, adorned in tattered riches and black armor, reaches forwards with a glowing gauntleted hand… 

Tark falls back into the temple of Vaketh and lands a moment later, attacking the Lonely passing underneath him.

Outside, the group is battling the Loney and Banshees, focusing again on the specters and using the bridge as a choke point for the Lonely.

Unfortunately, the Lonely have harpoon-like arms and manage to snare Buumi and drag him into the Sickening Radiance.

With a snort of derision, Cirrus lets his Radiance end.

The group destroys the Banshees then turn their attention to the Lonely.

Once again, they manage to push several Lonely off of the bridge and into the lava, though several manage to use their arms to latch on and save themselves from the fall, Gundren then just shoots them.

Feanon pushes another Lonely into the lava and then decides to try something new and novel, he scoops up 1,000lbs of molten lava.

As the group charges forward, pushing the last twenty feet of the bridge, most of them make the temple proper.

Inside, Tark battles the lonely with Buumi rushing to assist and Snorbul close behind.

As the last few shadowfell creatures are slain, Feanon envelopes one in the Molten Lava he brought from below.

The creatures dies with a hiss of gasses escaping the molded lava.

The stormabove flashes and pulses with energy and Feanon realizes they are witnessing a Teleport Spell from the other side.

Flashes of discharging purple lighting resolve into monstrous forms.

Four massive, lanky shapes can be seen embroiled in darkness. The shapes are angular, maybe elves once? 

The group has seen such creatures before; Vizeron’s apprentice turned into one of these things when he failed to become a Lich.  These are *Boneclaws.*

Four of these creatures surround a figure at the center of the temple

At the heart of the chamber, is the figure Tark saw at the head of the Army of the Dead.

Clad in ancient armor and adorned with jewelry, feathers and glowing source-stones, the figure is tall and lanky.  Its figure is far more elegant than that of a human.  A long boney tail and sinuous neck speaks to its serpentine nature and its helmet mimics the cobra-like hood it would have had in life. Cold glints of light can be seen in the recessed eye sockets of its headdress adorned Helmet.

Arcane magic radiates from him and Feanon notes at least two active spell effects.

The Saurian Lord lets forth a dusty hiss which shakes the feathers of its armor, and a voice echoes in the temple in his own language.

(in Saurian) “Interlopersss, we are no longer amused.  This endsss here…”
