Tark heads into the cave the Oni came from, remembering the fiend was wet with blood BEFORE being killed.

Patches and the Kid climb down from where the child ran to safety and rejoin the group.

Tark comes out of the cave with a body and Buumi steps up to help.

It is the body of an old man that the child identifies as Old Man Elmet, the identity the Oni infiltrator had stolen

The group walks down to the grove center and the clearing with the Standing stone.

Across the sunken grove, the group spots movement as over a dozen people come down the road, having heard the sounds of the short battle (gunshots).

Doc B is leading the pack

once the two groups see one another, the alert edge leaves eveyone and their pace slows. 

Doc B Approaches with Gneiss, Chani and Maximus

a small blue comet zips out of the trees at Doc's call.

A small pixie named Laconia and servant to Doc from the Winter Court.

Tark is delighted and when asked what animal he wishes to be (answering; Fox) he is promptly polymorphed into a furry beast by the Pixie.

Tark then proceeds to get the zoomies as a fox for a while.

Maximus takes the child back to the village, Gneiss and Chani say hi to Snorbul and suggest they go drinking together.

Many of the villagers that came with Doc mourn Elmet and watch Cirrus perform a burial ceremony for the poor man.

Patches steals his wedding ring and locket, but ends up putting the Locket back.

They ask that the body remain on the altar until morning, so that all the town can pay their respects before burying him here at the Old Stone.

Cirrus agrees and remains at the Old Stone with Tark, Doc B, and Gundren.

Snorbul heads to the tavern with Gneiss and Chani.

Patches heads to the Fane to Selune and her shrine beneath it to Elistraee 

Buumi heads back to the keep while Fey'Anon goes to his Tower to meditate

While the others rest for the night, Patches slips into the hidden tunnels beneath the Fane of Selune.

behind a hidden door, the small circular chapel gleams.

The chamber is circular with flowing water cut into channels depicting the phases of the moon as sections of floor.

water flows in from above and a small channel, cut through the rock for dozens of feet to allow a beam of moonlight to illuminate the small chamber illuminates the water.

Patches takes the small enchanted crystal she took from Cairngorm and places it on the altar and prays.

With the light of the full moon refracting off of the enchanted crystal, Patches feels a connection and asks questions of the goddess.

She asks if saving Cercei now would be a tactical advantage - yes.

Would wishing Finn to safety be met with Divine interference from Lolth - yes.

Would bringing in Baenre be an effective way to save Finn - yes.

Satisfied with her communion, Patches meditates for a few more hours before returning to Over the Moon.

Heading deep into the secret corridors of the Tavern, Patches finds her personal quarters, in an oasis-like cavern with all the creature comforts.

The chamber contains sets of crafting equipment and work tables as well as a small training area.

The chamber also has a number of small doors and bridges connecting along the ceiling for Mr. Pickles to come and go from, delivering Patches information.

Patches rests until morning.

Snorbul meanwhile has been drinking with the Amnians and Dwarves in the lower level of the Tavern and has passed out drunk, surrounded by good cheer.

Fey takes the evening to talk with Theodemir and get a read on his current state.

The soul is definitely degrading within the ring, but it has many months before it will become a serious issue, though Theodemir will slumber more and more as he degrades.

The others at the Grove are relaxing; Tark playing catch with Laconia, Doc and Gundren sleeping away, and Cirrus staring up at the moon, praying to Selune.

Cirrus seeks affirmation and receives a wash of emotion confirming that he is on the right path.

Tark asks how much longer before the rest of the town arrives to pay their respects for Elmet and is told that they are not expected until morning so Tark goes to sleep.

The sun rises the next day.

As the morning truly begins, a number of people arrive from along the trade way and set up in the center of town.

Mr. Pickles alerts Patches and she heads topside to check it out.

Snorbul awakes in a patch of drool, his mouth tasting like cheese but surprisingly un-hung over.  He heads up to the common room on the main floor.

finishing his Reverie in his tower, Fey'Anon is alerted by the presence of newcomers and scries the town center, seeing a number of new arrivals that pique his interest.

Fey heads to the docks to go and see who these people are.

Over in the grove, the troupe is enjoying a morning breakfast of foraged nuts and berries from Doc.

The townsfolk begin to show up, and over the next several hours (and in fact, day) villagers come to pay their respects to Elmet.

Cirrus leads the initial group through a burial right and a cairn is built for the dead man.

Looking around the grove, many cairns can be seen overgrown by grass and flowers, the oldest of which are sinking into the earth, leaving nothing behind save a small lump.

The villagers; subjects of Cirrus, show great respect and deference though are obviously taken aback by their new Lord.

There's an air of cautious awe as many of the villagers meet their Baron for the first time.

The main ceremony is finished and most of the villagers leave, though some are still arriving to the grove having missed the initial ceremony.

The group is discussing what to do next when they feel the earth shake.

the earth shakes again and they realize it to be the footsteps of a massive creature.

Tark leaps into action, heading toward the Trade Way with the others follow in close pursuit riding Arkto, Gundren's summoned Owlbear mount.

As they crest one of the hills and look down upon the Trade Way, they see a massive figure with a fiery beard and black plate armor, a massive smoldering hammer held by his side.  A Fire Giant.

And the Giant now appears to be waiting.

The small group approaches and quickly discover the giant to be non-hostile and named **Surtr Emberstrike, of Ironslag**.

In fact, it is here to smith alongside Gundren, hoping to learn enough to help him reforge The Vonindod, a massive construct of Giant make.

Gundren welcomes Surtr to the Barony.

The Giant and the small group turn and head into the town center.

Meanwhile, Snorbul walks out into the town center, throwing the doors to Over The Moon out wide...and is promptly blinded by the sunlight.

Screaming in agony, the Deep Gnome is pulled back into the relative shadow of the tavern by Patches.

Blinking painful tears from his eyes, Patches takes out the second pair of sun-shades and demonstrates their use.  

Snorbul thanks Patches and puts on a pair.

The two of them head into the town center just as Fey'Anon arrives from the northern road.

The town center is abuzz with villagers and newcomers.

An older human couple on a cart look to be a baker and scribe, and indeed, JmJm comes out of the Theater to call over his "personal historian, **Demelza Bluefingers**" and the human lady hustles over to her client.

The baker, **Carka Whitefingers** heads into Over the Moon and gets access to the kitchens to whip up a quick job application, taking ingredients from his cart.

Patches spots Claudine and Marzeline and heads over to talk with them about getting them set up with their own Alchemy shop.

Snorbul watches the busy crossroads but is distracted by movement from around the corner of the Tavern.

A small cloaked figure with a massive sword steps forward.  Snorbul introduces himself...and the small man attacks!

Snorbul is smacked back by a cut, barely deflecting with his axe, but he comes back in with a fury, battering the sword aside and sweeping the other Deep Gnome off his feet.

Axe to the throat of this seemingly hostile other Svirfneblin, Snorbul demands answers.

**Belairofos **yields and swears his sword to Snorbul.  The Swordmaster mentioned that he has been looking for Snorbul ever since he watched him beat a Minotaur in the fighting pits.

Fey scans the crowd and notes a High-Elven woman, dressed as if from Evermeet and approaches her just as her carriage shrinks to the size of an apple and she puts it in her satchel.

Clearly a woman of magical means, Fey breaks the ice masterfully and they begin a great discussion on the nature of magic.

Fey invites her to his tower and she graciously accepts, mentioning that in her work for **Cirrus, Chosen of Selune** she will need access to the library.

Fey's smile goes wooden as he realizes she's not here for him...but no matter, he figures it might end up working more in his favor.

Buumi is seen chatting with a contingent of Dragonborn knights, riding great monitor lizards and he motions up to the keep.

The riders slink off quickly up the switchbacks.

The thudding of massive footfalls draws the attention of the whole village as the fire giant strolls into town with the rest of the party.

No one panics with the Heralds here.

Arriving in town, Tark rushes toward the tavern, desperate to find some marshmallows to toast from the body heat of the fire giant.

He walks past a slim man in elegant robes and a tall red and gold hat that tries to get his attention.  Tark doesn't see him.

Heading into Over the Moon, the monk practically bumps into Carka coming out with donuts.

Tark grabs one, eats it and remarks how good it is, then grabs several more (with marshmallow toppings) and heads back to the giant.

By now, Gundren and his brothers have been discussing how best to use the giant; they decide to have him work on a Furnace for them and the giant agrees.

As Tark is melting the top of his donut, and hands one to Surtr (who thinks they are pretty good, though small), the slim man begins to talk to Tark.

he introduces himself as the Illusionist Painter **Jin Sakama **of Eastgate and is here to paint the story of The Shadow Monk.

Tark is not particularly interested, but the painter insists he wont be a bother and will simply paint in the area.

Tark shrugs and agrees.

Fey takes his leave from the elven woman **Beryan **as Cirrus approaches and begins to talk with the woman himself - finding out that she is a Sage of Selune - and heads over to the last person he expected to see in the Barony.

Fey approaches the tailor the group met long ago in Baldur's Gate and then again recently in Silverymoon - **Mister Markensworth**. 

Incredulous that the tailor would come here, and feeling a little bad about how the group has treated the man in the past, Fey accepts the man as his personal tailor.

Having lost both past businesses, Markensworth is happy enough to have steady employ to a Barony, even if it is with *these* people...

As the different followers, retainers and new allies begin to head off to their respective areas to set up, the group congregates and discuss something Patches mentioned the night before, just before fighting the Oni.

Saving Cercei.

The group decide that it is a good use of a wish spell, not only to save Buumi's daughter, but to deprive the enemy of an asset.

As they turn to head from New Daggerford, Gundren is delivered a letter from Lady Faye of Baldur's Gate.

Checking the letter, it mentions several promising leads on magical relics and locations: 

**The Iron Keep of the Moonshae Isles for** **The Eye of Balor**. 

**The Spine of the World and Raven Rock for the ancient Ring of Uthgardt,** 

**The Ruins of Spirit Soaring Cathedral to Denier, god of knowledge in the Snowflake mountains** 

**The Plain of Standing Stones and the lost Chardalyn Mines.**

They all head to Old Stone, telling the citizenry on the way to prepare for a potential battle, or similar disruptive event as they have no idea what will happen when they try and bring Cercei here.

It takes about an hour of walking, and the group pass several mourners for Elmet, but they arrive at the Grove easily.

Doc welcomes them, offering everyone a good Yam stew and then hears about the plan for Cercei 

Doc thinks its a great idea and prepares the land, telling it that they made need its help.

Several large mounds of earth and plants rise slightly out of the nearby ponds, ready to come to Doc's call.

The group array themselves for trouble, preparing spells and items just in case.

Patches steps forward, drawing her sword and holding it up in front of the stone.

Staring into the softly glowing diamond in the hilt, the last one with a glow, Patches utters the words "I wish..."

Time seems to freeze and the world goes dark, as if in twilight. 

Unable to look upwards due to time being frozen, Patches feels a presence above her, vast and unknowable.

A booming voice calls out from the sky, resonating in the rogue's very being "It is done, This Blade of Tymora is no more"

Time resumes and a galeforce wind crashes over the group from behind.

They all spin and watch as a great tear in reality hovers in the air twenty feet away.

Only open for an instant, most of the group is so caught off guard that they only see the form of a skinny Black Dragon hurtling from the rent toward them.

Patches sees more.

She sees the market of Mantol Derrith, the underdark outpost almost directly beneath the Barony, she sees Li Xian in his true form reaching out for the portal.

She sees a massive ethereal figure, barred from coming to hallowed ground on the other side of the rift, strips of tattered monochromatic cloth splayed out and floating as if underwater, and a ghostly figure at its center.

Where it's face should be on its ghostly form, only a sucking void is visible, but from it can be felt a terrifying intelligence - Corpsetaker.

The rift closes in an instant and the form of Cercei crashes to the ground but does not move as Cirrus paralyzes the dragon with a Hold spell from his staff.

Though paralyzed, a painful screeching wail rises from the dragon, the sound of agony.

Buumi turns to Fey and the wizard casts a deep sleep over the dragon, ending her pain.

Doc and Buumi both rush forwards to administer healing and Tark pulls out his medicine kit and begins to look over Cercei.

Cercei is much bigger than she should be for her age, Fey notes that she must have been artificially grown, but it has caused problems.

There are gaps in the scales that show raw, blistered flesh and she looks far too skinny, her limbs almost stretched.

Buumi picks her up with help from Tark, Snorbul and Gundren while Doc rushes over to a nearby slope.

Casting a modified Earth spell, Doc forms a small cave for her and they bring Cercei into it and set her down and begin to get to work healing her body.

Its going to be a slow process undoing the damage to her body, if it CAN be undone.

Her mind is another question entirely.

Cirrus enacts a dreaming and Buumi goes in to the dream to talk to his daughter.

After it is done, Buumi awakes, wiping tears from his eyes and thanks Cirrus.

They leave the small cave, Doc remaining behind to administer aid to the injured dragon.

The group gathers around and Buumi begins to relay what Cercei told him, though not before Snorbul relays his disbelief about the entire situation.

Cercei is in a bad way and will remain in a deep slumber for now, the hallowed ground will protect her mind while Doc heals her body.

Corpsetaker is in Mantol Derrith with Li Xian and has been for some time now, they are searching for **Gravenhollow **but are currently dealing with a more pressing issue.

The Demon Lords walk the Underdark and one is in Mantol Derith.  Somehow it is preventing people from leaving the Underdark town.

The Demon Lords are not in the Underdark willingly, something brought them against their will.

Orcus has found and obtained a fragment of The Last Word

The group discusses what this all means with Cirrus freaking out that the entire Abyss is apparently beneath their feet.  He thinks its time to send the two artifact pieces they DO have, to Bahamut for safe keeping.

While the group discusses, Patches slinks back into the cave and prays over Cercei, focusing on her crystal fragment.

Buumi heads in and sits next to Patches and spends some time sitting next to Cercei.

Tark, hearing about Li, heads off to find his little treehouse in the woods near the Dojo, needing space to think about how to contact Bahamut.

 The only thing he can think of is finding the Avatar of Bahamut on the prime material, or contacting Aurinax the Gold Dragon...
