The first wave of Undead fodder mindlessly pushes through the shield and is chewed apart by Doc B’s insect Swarm as they bring firelances to bear.

As Fawden’s barrier falters from the charging Mummies, a barrage of poorly aimed Firelance shots sail through, hitting friendly targets and the Ice walls creating the chokepoint being held by Snorbul and Tark

The Mummies trudge through the Swarm, covered in the magical insects, but they persist only to be knocked back into the spell by a Thunderwave from JmJm galloping past on Steden.

Thorna calls down a blast of Lightning on the charging undead and the Storm on the other side of the barrier intensifies

The bard blazes on by, Wraiths in pursuit  

The Mummy Lord explodes into a whirlwind of Sand and blitzes past the defenses to strike at Cirrus by the Ritual.

The ancient Saurian’s glittering Khopesh strikes the Warlock with its cursed edge and Cirrus lets out a cry of pain before leaping back and up, his black wings flapping to distance himself from the Mummy Lord

Gundren throws a small shining metal cube to the ground nearby and his Instant Fortress erupts thirty feet into the air, creating a gleaming tower of Adamantine.

The spellcasters and Gundren rush to take cover in the Tower but are accosted by flitting shades and Wraiths that manage to survive the initial onslaught.

Buumi raises his warhammer into the air and with a Flash of light and shout, activates his Holy Nimbus which burns away all nearby shadows and ghostly apparitions.

The Wraiths are quickly slain by Snorbul’s axe, Thornas lightning, JmJm’s deft Inkblade and Tark’s rapid blows.  

Patches rushes the Mummy Lord and in a blaze of speed, attacks the creature with a zephyr strike, staggering it

It lets out a Blasphemous word, the dark uttering fueled by Vecna, and stuns Feanon and Patches.

The mummy Lord turns its blade upon its stunned victims, but the others in the group rush to assist their comrades

Patches breaks out of the Stun long enough to drink a potion of speed

The Saurian Mummy Lord is then hacked apart by enchanted blades and blasted by called Lightning from Thorna.

Buumi flies up to Cirrus and cleanses him of the Mummy Lord’s Curse before diving back down to hold the breach as another wave of Undead make for Fawden’s barrier.

On the other side of the shield, the group sees a flash of purple light as the Death Lord and his Boneclaws teleport to the battlefield.

The storm rumbles above the City of the Dead and flashes of lightning illuminate the great black Pyramid at its heart - great shapes can be seen flying, silhouetted against the storm.

The storm rumbles and the shadows seem as if a great face looms down from the thunderclouds. Vecna whispers curses into the group’s ears, causing psychic damage and sapping their speed.

 The Great winged creatures high above the battlefield begin their dive toward the open and growing gateway.

Tark sees the Death Lord hold a great Sourcework sword above his head just as the Boneclaws rush and swirl around him like a cloak of dark armor and bone and the edge of the sword erupts with burning, crackling energy.

The Deathlord rushes the Barrier with incredible speed and Tark drops a Darkness spell at gateway just as the barrier falters and another wave of undead charge through into the meatgrinder.

Blind firelance shots rip through the Darkness, slamming into the Ice Wall which shatters several sections forcing Feanon to reinforce the barrier

Many more shots begin to spark and flash as they glance off the Adamantine tower

A few shades manage to get past the Insect Swarm and Darkness, but are quickly killed.

The Death Lord suddenly appears, leaping through the Darkness and shadowstepping instantly behind the group and the Adamantine Tower.

The swirling mass of bone and shadow, wielding the glowing Greatsword rushes the tower, scaling the exterior in a heartbeat and pressing Gundren atop it.

The Deathlord slashes Gundren with the greatsword and then unleashes an explosion of Negative energy, causing pain to the entire group and causing Doc B’s concentration to falter.

The ancient Saurian then turns and shadowsteps to Tark, looking to settle a previous score with the Monk and lays into him with the sweeping, burning blade.

The gateway widens further and Feanon recasts his ice wall to compensate, blasting apart a wave of charging skeletons and Ghouls as they emerge from Tark’s Darkness.

Moments later with a thundercrack of noise a monstrous undead bird smashes through a section of the wall, clearly one of the creatures that had been in a flying dive to the gateway

It tumbles in a sprawl of bone and feathers

It’s rider however lands on his metal-armored feet, skidding across the stone

The serpentine Death Knight raises its sword above its head and with a slash, hurls a Hellfire Orb to detonate in the heart of the group.

Fire and necrotic energy eats at them and the tower and Gundren turns his shots from the Death Lord dueling against Tark and Snorbul, to the newly arrived Death Knight.

Patches rushes the Death Knight, unwilling to let the powerful foe go uncontested.

Buumi sees the Ice Wall with a massive hole and the “hot gates” quickly crumbling and turns toward the embattled Death Lord and joins the fray 

Thorna lets loose another blast of lightning into the approaching hordes of Undead.

Cirrus sees the battle quickly turning to chaos, this is taking too long.  He’s too close to fail now and he approaches the ritual circle

A coating of what looks like Molten metal now completely covers Fawden and the great anemone-like growth is shuddering and beginning to dissolve.

Cirrus turns all his will to speeding the ritual and helps to guide the incredible power

It burns into Fawden, speeding the process, but Cirrus is thrown back moments later, by a blast of pure energy

He shouts in pain and his skin smokes.  He’s not sure how much feedback like that his body can take and realizes that even that blast has *wounded *him.

The battle rages and another massive undead Roc smashes through the Ice Wall, bringing with it another armored Saurian Death Knight.

Patches duels the first Death Knight and with a flash of moonlight, explodes into a whirlwind of enchanted strikes, staggering and wounding the Death Knight badly

JmJm rushes across the battlefield atop Steden, dodging shades and Wraiths and bringing his Inkblade to bear. 

The first Death Knight falls beneath their blades.

The Bard pulls on a mysterious glove from his past and an Arcane hand materializes on the battlefield.

Patches rushes across the arena, slaying all in her path as she tries desperately to control the onslaught of the Undead hordes as Thorna continues to call lightning blast after blast.

From the darkness, another volley of blind-fired Firelance shots flash out, hitting randomly

Tark’s Darkness spell drops as the Death Lord slashes into the monk, dropping his concentration.

The gate can be seen again and piles of bones can be seen scattered in front of it.

The press of the Undead hordes is no less intense and indeed, a huge gleaming form can be seen rapidly approaching the gate.

With a rapid flurry and perfect riposte, the Death Lord’s burning blade swipes across, taking Tark’s left hand off at the elbow and then knocks the dismembered monk away

Tark falls to the ground even as healing spells wash over him from Doc and he blinks away unconsciousness

He looks down at his cauterized stump and howls in pain and then surprise as a voice asks to help him.

Tark accepts.

with a thunderclap, the limb regrows out of crimson energy.

Vaketh, god of Power lends his divine Intervention to Tark.

The monk rushes back to the melee with his god-hand and proceeds to smash the Death Lord, each strike landing with a thunderclap of power.

One by one, the Boneclaws surrounding and making the Death Lord invulnerable are destroyed, leaving the Saurian Lord staggered.

A figure appears, robed in white and floating above the battleground

With a flash of fire, she launches scorching bolts at the unsuspecting casters.

The Lady in White is quickly set upon by the group, triggering a wave of defensive spells from her as she misty steps away to safety

A flurry of spells and counterspells leaves the group with their attention turned away from the Death Lord and his Knights and focusing on the new threat of The Lady.

The Lady is surrounded and her highly modified body is no match for the crushing power of the enchanted arsenal wielded by the group

She screams in pain and the banshee like wail eats at the groups life-force

Her form then twists and grows, changing as she casts an immense spell upon herself

Where once stood a lithe and small female form, now towers a gargantuan giant of inky blackness.  It exudes an aura of death that saps the strength of all around it.

Cirrus sees the massive Nightstalker and calls to Selune for a similarly powerful ally to assist them, summoning his Seraphim through the burgeoning portal.

The celestial appears in a flash of moonlight and with a deadly array of burning weapons, assaults The Lady in White

Something large pushes its way through Fawden’s shield, allowing another wave of fodder inside that unleashes a volley of Firelance shots into the Tower and nearby party.

Gundren sees the huge wave of enemies finally establishing a beachhead and hurls a Ruby from his helmet, then another, and another as wave after wave of undead is destroyed by Walls of fire that erupt from the thrown rubies.

Charging through the conflagration though, is the massive form of “animated” armor looking like Ruby Dragon.

Blazing with black fire, the Hollow Dragon - animated by the twisted Soul of Jareem’s Mate - charges the group just as the two Undead Roc’s recover their feet.

Seeing a veritable onslaught of giant creatures charging them, Tark holds up the gleaming Ruby crystal scale given to him by Jareem.

Tark cries out for help!

He is answered by more than an ancient Dragon.

Erupting from an Orange portal of light, Jareem charges his long dead Mate.

The beautiful ruby crystals of Jareem’s hide are completely hidden by the swirling carapace of full armor, encasing him in Orange light.

Carthas, god of Protection and Order intervenes

Nigh invulnerable, Jareem meets the Hollow Dragon and a titanic struggle ensues.

Patches is swiped at by the Rocs and forced to evade and counterattack

Firelance shots make it through the Walls of Fire and detonate against the now badly scored and marred Adamantine tower

The first Firewall goes down, dispelled

Then the second, then the third and a trio of dark levitating figures appear above the heads of the marching legions of Undead.

The lead figure; with a scarred, pale and bloody face,  resplendent in dark robes with a staff made of metal bone. He raises a dark hand wreathed in energies to Fawden’s barrier.

It collapses beneath his touch and the tidal wave of Undead surge forward - Just as Gundren hurls another Firewall gem

The front rows are blasted, as is the oncoming Lich which simply pushes through the flame.

Gundren lets out a volley of shots into the thing just as JmJm charges it and commands his Arcane Hand to assault.

They smash into the Lich just as he lets loose a Disintegration spell into the Instant Fortress

In a flash of light, the entire north side of the tower is gone.

The nearby undead all swivel their firelances to blast the now exposed interior

Nearby, The Lady is smashed out of her Nightstalker form and then felled, releasing one last Banshee wail

Tark and Snorbul face down the Death Lord - now brutally damaged

The Death Lord lunges in one last assault, laying into Snorbul

With two deft cuts, Snorbul is dismembered and cast aside where he rolls to the ground screaming - in rage.

The group looks around at the carnage.

The tower is failing and taking more and more shots, forcing the spellcasters to evacuate

Jareem, empowered by Carthas, battles his long dead mate to a standstill

The Lady in White is downed, but machina implants begin to glow

Two monstrous Rocs and a Death Knight charge into melee, fire and energy beginning to wreathe the Death Knights sword as he prepares a Hellfire Orb. 

Two wizards of some power and the Lich who penned Vecna’s Dark Tome move above waves of Undead minions

Beyond the Gate, Giant forms can be seen nearing the barrier, hulking and undead  Storm Giants wielding great cannons of Saurian technology

Snorbul crawls back to the fray and with Tark’s god-hand and the Seraphim of Selune, they smite and finally slay the Death Lord, shattering its armor of swirling Boneclaws one final time and burning the Undead Lord to dust.

Cirrus looks to the ritual and discerns that there’s mere seconds from the ritual being complete but his gaze pans out to the unending onslaught of the Undead armies.

Vecna whispers vile curses into his mind, causing pain and torment

Feanon Counterspells a strike from the nearby Lich, who then utters a word of power, pointing at Tark.

The invigorated Monk turns and is unaffected by the attack. A Power Word Kill he survives from Doc B’s healing.

JmJm then smashes the Lich to the ground under his Arcane Hand, but the Lich starts to rise again moments later

The two nearby Wizards move forward to dispel the Arcane Hand and Counterspell any reprisal

Two more Rocs with Death Knight riders can be seen beginning their dive toward the Gate and the Undead Storm Giants are moments away.

Doc B turns, about to summon a Tidal Wave to keep back the Undead army as the last Firewall wavers and fades

Thorna throws her hand into the air, holding her hammer high to the sky and calls forth to the gods to intervene!

At first nothing happens…then, the group realizes that all time seems to be frozen except themselves…

A golden light shines through the Storm clouds above Vecna’s pyramid.

Horrah, goddess of time has intervened at Thorna’s call.

Feanon recognizes the Timestop magic and quickly stops his allies from striking out and shattering the fragile spell. He informs them of the rules of the Timestop and they gather to heal and revitalize, preparing for a final defense.

All save for Cirrus

He once more turns to the Ritual, certain now that no matter the cost, he will end it here and now.

He reaches forth toward the glowing ring of light, now fully engulfing the entire interior of the Veil.

There’s a flash of pain in his hands which quickly goes numb.

He wills the spell to end and pushes against the ritual with all his considerable magical might.

Fawden is destroyed in a flash of light that engulfs everything.

…

The group blinks, their eyes working once more and they find themselves floating, as if in the Astral Sea.

Ossein debris, detritus and a few pieces of treasure from the battle float nearby

They look around, coming to their senses and see that they are floating among a gloriously colorful rainbow nebula

Stars gleam and shine among a million crystalline branches of a massive treelike structure winding itself through the nebula,

Its branches reach and stretch to every star.

Cirrus looks upon it in awe, knowing exactly what it is - Yggdrasil, the World Tree.

The group feels strange in this place and the air hums with residual power from the ritual.

How were they brought here? And Where is “here” really?

These questions begin to form on many lips but one voice, echoing with universe altering power simply says “I really wish we were home right now!”

The light instantly changes and gravity reasserts itself and the group finds themselves in the Town Square of their Barony, twenty feet away from The Establishment.

Cirrus falls to his knees, weeping having been so close to his Lady’s Domain and now been brought here by a careless *wish*

Exhausted, confused and wounded, many of them hobble into Patches establishment for a much needed drink as a crowd begins to form and news of the FDFs return begins to spread…
