Cirrus enters a dark, ominous chamber.

Moments later, Liara appears herself.

Thinking the Cleric might have lured him here to finally take him out, Cirrus accosts the woman.

Buumi appears a few moments later, finding the situation tense.

Back at the entrance to the Temple, the group gathers around the dias, weighing the danger of their options.

Feanon investigates and determines that it is a teleporter (and relatively safe) to take them down into the temple proper.

Gundren barges past, calling the rest a bunch of pansies.

The others follow momentarily and find themselves facing a strange and tense scene.

Liara is playing her stringed instrument to calm Cirrus.

Covered in scratches, but seemingly charming a companion, Tark demands that the woman cease her playing, on pain of death.

Liara is shocked by the threat, but complies quickly, explaining that Cirrus grew irate at the situation, and like before, he accosted her.

Buumi backs up Liara’s story and then moves off to comfort and talk with Cirrus.

As the situation calms, the group notes a voice.

It says “May the light of Preservation guide you””.

They also mention that as each of them was teleported from above, they each heard a question asked “What do you seek at this font of power?”

As the group thinks about what it could mean, the group turns to observe the chamber they are in.

An almost identical copy of the entryway aboveground, this level of the temple is a single room, the openings upstairs blocked by stone down here.

The Monoliths appear as solid columns of stone, descending from the ceiling.

Different than above though, there are a few pillars, upon which shine mirrors.

The mirrors focus the light and appear to be able to turn.

Thinking on what the voice had called out to them, they think that it is a puzzle involving the religion here and the mirrors.

Just as Buumi is calling out to the others to try a solution, all three mirrors are moved without coordination.

With a grinding and whooshing sound, the mechanical looking vents disgorge a number of viscous looking elemental/golem creatures.

Bloodied and exhausted from the battle at the entrance and the day of hard hiking, the group shares grim expressions of determination.

Battle ensues with the stone creatures lashing out with flint-sharp talons and blasts of Eldritch force.

Tark and Buumi battle one to the side while the group focuses their fire on the ones that came out of the vents near Snorbul.

Gundren lays down a veritable hail of gunfire, shredding one in the opening moments of the battle.

Tark channels his Ki and strikes at one of the monsters, however the release of energy cascades and unleashes a surge of Wild Magic, reversing the gravity within 30ft of Tark.

Two of the Monsters, Buumi and Tark all begin to “fall” to the ceiling.

Tark shadowsteps to the vent, trying to grab it an arrest his fall, but he slips and begins falling again.

Buumi lets out a shout of panic as he falls, eying the rapidly approaching ceiling…with no magic to arrest his fall, this is going to hurt or possibly even kill him…

Feanon rushes forward, stepping into the reversed gravity and beginning to fall before suddenly becoming fixed in space, as he does he reaches forward and snares Buumi in a Telekinetic grip, arresting his fall and moving Buumi through the air toward the remaining enemies in a graceful arc.

The falling monsters hit the ceiling and explode into shards.

The wild magic ends and Tark shadowsteps over just as Buumi falls from the air with his hammer.

Snorbul has finally trudged into melee with the surviving monsters and between him, Gundren, Tark and Snorbul, they smash the remaining creatures to dust.

Even more tired and injured, they decide not to push their luck, settling down to rest rather than continue the puzzle.

As they rest, Feanon studies his ritual spell and thinks on what he could use as The Essence of Calamity and his mind wanders to the Cult and its works.

Buumi watches over Cirrus while they rest, unsure if his friend actually sleeps, but guarding him anyway.

The rest is uneventful, but near the end, the group moved to make some food and finds that their rations have all spoiled.

They decide that they can survive if needed, on the Horn of Plenty that Gundren has stashed in the Bag of Holding.  It would be risky, so they abstain from eating for as long as they can, skipping breakfast.

During the rest, they discussed the puzzle before them and come to the conclusion that the lights must shine on the symbols of the gods aligned to *Preservation, *as opposed to Ruin.

Liara explains that Preservation and Ruin are analogous to the Positive and Negative energy planes.

Remembering what they have learned of this world’s pantheon thus far, the group inspects the symbols and quickly discern the gods aligned to Preservation.

They adjust the mirrors to illuminate them, and as they do, the daius activates and the group steps into it, teleported to the next level.

The next level is almost a mirror of the one above, save one wall, covered in inscribed tiles and flanked by spiked protrustions

The voice once again calls out

“Avoid the pitfalls of Ruin”

Looking up at the test before them, they quickly discern that someone must climb, only touching the god symbols aligned to preservation.

Tark goes to shadowstep to the top, but finds that it does not function here

Tark begins to climb, and as he does, the tiles begin to shift and move toward the spikes.

Tark makes quick progress, with the group below calling out the symbols and directions.

He comes to a blank section, the tiles in the midst of cycling and jumps for it, almost falling.

He gets all the way to the final set of symbols when Buumi calls out the wrong symbol and Tark is ejected from the wall with a flash of light.

He falls only ten feet before catching himself and beginning to ascend again.

He makes it to the top without further issue and finds a small altar, with a sourcestone device and button atop it.

He calls out a description and the group says its fine to press it.

He does and the dias activates again.

Feanon checks it again to ensure no shenanigans and finds it safe.

Tark returns to the group and they descend another level.

They find themselves in another mirror of the chamber they have now seen numerous times.

The archways which were blocked in the previous levels are now open to a misty expanse, a mirror-like waterplane extending off into the mists, unbroken by anything.

Looking at the monoliths, each of them on this level contains a large mirror.

Each of the group is drawn to a mirror, the symbol and color of it corresponding with their choice from the question “what do you seek at this font of power?”

Each of them reach out and touch the mirror, being transported to the Ethereal plane to talk with the entities that reside here…

Tark finds himself face to face with a younger Zhengyi, the embodiment of Power and Control in his life.

Furious at the lich’s presence, Tark immediately attacks it.

The being laughs and obliges, engaging in furious battle with the monk while talking to him.

not-Zheyngi explains that this is *exactly *what he should be doing; fighting and getting stronger.

The being explains that Tark needs all his power to fight the servant of Orcus that came to this world over a thousand years ago.

Tark has to stop it.

As they battle, Tark sees the great black pyramid and a glowing black skull above it in the storm-ridden sky, a glowing white eye in the center of its forehead…

Feanon finds himself face to face with Theodemir, his old teacher.

Feanon knows the ruse here and asks the being its actual name.

It smiles and says** Narhan **god of Knowledge

Finally getting somewhere in this land, Feanon smiles and begins to question the being.

He doesnt get far before realizing something strangely unsettling and yet also, so obvious.

This god of knowledge knows everything, but to it, all knowledge is of equal value.

This dawns on the wizard as, in the middle of questioning the god about what happened to the world, it asks the wizard to guess it’s physical size and spouts off about the nutritional information of grilled squid.

What Feanon manages to glean from the conversation though is that The god of Death for this world, Zalaam, is an Imposter.

He also learns that to continue his search for knowledge in this world, and to help fix it, he should seek the Isle of the Elves in the North West.

Snorbul finds himself face to face with his Uncle Gruttag, the gnome responsible for the emigration and savior of the village.

Confused, but generally understanding the nature of the vision, Snorbul talks with his “uncle”.

He learns that the world has undergone great and cataclysmic change over the last thousand years.

If Snorbul wishes to get back home to Faerun, he needs to seek the Feywild of this universe and a portal therin and if he wants the strength to get there, he should visit the Temple of Veketh.

Buumi finds himself face to face with his mother, young as if from her adventuring days.

Buumi greets the image warmly, but understands that this is not his mother, the thing merely adopted her image from his own mind.

He talks with the goddess, discovering that she is Orrah, the goddess of harmony, balance and time.

Buumi asks how he can help protect his friends here and she says that he is already on that path.

He asks how they can restore harmony to this world.

She says that for two of the Ritual items Feanon needs to help heal the cracks in the world - to head to The Black Sea, where this world and the Shadowfell meet.
