Breaking camp early, Lothli rode north on her horse, cresting a small hill about an hour after sunrise to see the city of Neverwinter sprawling before her. Crowds were already gathering for the day, streaming in from nearby hamlets to enjoy the Refounding Festival. As Lothli trotted toward the gates, the Tavern of Doors sprang open and Tark leaped out, followed one by one by the rest of the group — each emergence startling the horse further. Buumi provided some background on the city, the festival, and the long-dormant volcano overlooking the skyline. He also mentioned, rather casually, that he was the nephew of the city's lord — Lord Dagult Neverember.

## The Keep

Lothli, expressing her disdain for crowds, split off to the woods for a few days. The rest of the group headed for the Keep, with Patches hiding her Drow nature. They flagged down a wagon to carry them across the city and noticed they'd been followed by a small, very fat, very dirty halfling. Having nowhere else to go, they let him tag along. He introduced himself as a chimney sweep from the Shadowfell city of Gloomwrought, cursed to eat without end. Patches remarked that she too was cursed, and pulled forth The Reaver — the sight of which turned stomachs across the wagon.

Crossing the city, the group observed the festival in the park around Bluelake and the massive pavilion of the famed Sha'Alazzi. The driver explained that the Refounding Festival celebrated the city's independence from the assault of the Thayans and the oppression of the Netherese.

At the Keep, the group marched into the audience chamber of Lord Neverember, passing the statue of the late Jelvis Grinch. Inside, the Lord and his Archmage — Jeckeyll, a halfling woman — were concluding a conversation with a dark shade that proclaimed Thay had nothing to do with the undead mists before vanishing. Tark rudely introduced himself as the Lord nodded a greeting of recognition to his nephew Buumi.

The group recounted their exploits: Cragmaw Castle, the mists, the hag den, and the killing of Venomfang. Jeckeyll was fascinated by the jade golem. Lord Neverember was impressed enough to reward them 2,000 gold for the destruction of Venomfang — twice over. They discussed the mists and the dracolich, debating whether Thay might be behind it with another dread ring. The Lord revealed that the dragon had flown into the city, startling everyone, before disappearing down into the Chasm — which they had all thought was sealed by magic.

Neverember and Jeckeyll proposed hiring the group to descend into the Chasm and investigate what had happened to the dragon and what power had transformed it into a Dracolich. The mission would wait a few days while Jeckeyll researched the magical barrier, the Thayan threat, and the incidents of undeath.

## The Spellforged Adventuring Company

Lord Neverember presented the group with a writ of patronage and formally founded the Spellforged Adventuring Company, granting them the right to accept questing contracts from bounty boards. With business concluded, the group decided to enjoy the festival while Jeckeyll conducted her research.

On their way out of the Keep, a call from behind had them turning to see Lorde — JmJm's most hated rival. A small, attractive bard accompanied by Gronk, her hulking, muscle-bound barbarian backup singer. The group noticed their matching gender-symbol earrings. Lorde verbally dismantled JmJm before challenging him to meet her on the bard's stage at the festival.

## The Moonstone Mask

The group traveled to the Moonstone Mask Inn via portal. Inside, other adventurers milled about accepting contracts. JmJm immediately commandeered the stage, playing over the local bard and winning the room's favor. Buumi wasted no time getting drunk. Fëanon sought out the best-looking wizard in the place and spotted the gold-toothed smile of Kangaxx, who waved him over.

Kangaxx told the group his story. He and his companions had found ancient ruins down in the Chasm, but they triggered a trap that transmuted his companions into gold. He'd saved himself, but not before his teeth were turned. He asked the group to rescue his friends — anything they carried would be theirs as payment. The group agreed.

## The Temple of Oghma

Patches led the group to the Temple of Oghma, disappearing briefly only to reappear seconds later dressed in the full regalia of a Knight of Baldur's Gate. The cleric fetched a high priest to attend to such a distinguished visitor. Upon seeing the seriousness of Patches' cursed dagger, the high priest took the group to a summoning chamber and called forth a Deva — a celestial messenger — who revealed how to cleanse the weapon. Patches would need to gather four ingredients: a black opal, moonstone dust, an enchanted mithril mallet, and a hag's tooth. A ritual would draw the hag bound within the dagger into the open, where it could be slain under a full moon.

## Sha'Alazzi's Emporium

The group headed into the festival proper around Bluelake. Along the way, a druid asked for help communicating with mermen who had taken up residence in the lake. Tark swam out to find them but couldn't hold his breath long enough. JmJm verbally abused the druid until he left in a huff, though he asked Doctor Breakfast to return to him later.

They made their way to the biggest pavilion — Sha'Alazzi's Magic Emporium — and were amazed by the hooded attendants and the Shield Sentinel Golem standing guard in the center of the tent. The group purchased a new shield and plate armor for Buumi, the black opal for Patches' ritual, a Ring of Fire Elemental Control, and boots of warmth, spending more than half their gold. The ring was sold by Sha'Alazzi himself, who entertained their prolonged investigation into whether the fire elemental in the nearby glass cube was in anguish. It was not.

Recognizing the group as a capable band, Sha'Alazzi offered them a reward for clearing out a magic tower he'd acquired from a mage — overrun with fiends and needing to be cleaned before resale. He offered two magic items worth up to 2,000 gold each. The group agreed, and with a clap of his hands, they were transported inside a miniature iron tower that had been sitting on his shelves moments before.

The group found themselves in a large circular room — beautifully gilded marble stretching in every direction. By a door that looked like it led upward, two bearded devils turned to face them.
