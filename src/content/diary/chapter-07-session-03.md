**The Sanctum**

Standing atop the winding staircase and facing the dark Iron door of the sanctum, the group is buffeted by cold wind.

Now free of ice, Fey walks to the door with Megno and they begin inspecting it, testing for arcane wards and traps while the others look on, their winter gear covered in blowing snow.

The wizards note that the door is etched in tiny runes and symbols and that the entire door appears to function much like the archway further down the mountain.

Fey puts forth some power and a small section of the door lights up, the runes and symbols glowing briefly before the energy dissipates.

Megno whispers over that he can help, but Fey responds curtly that he has it covered.  Cirrus chuckles to himself in the background at this "hiccup".

Fey reaches his hand out once more, this time pouring a significant amount of power into the door, and does not stop.

Expending a 6th level spell slot to do so, the door becomes energized and glows as all the arcane symbols become energized and the door vanishes in a flash of light.

A dark set of stairs, coated in frost descends into darkness, the interior of this place made of dark granite and slab-like unadorned, angled walls.

Checking the door frame, Fey realizes that he can pull the door back with a similar expenditure of energy, or the door would re-materialize after about 9 hours.

Tired and cold from the climb up the mountain, the group decides to set up a Tiny Hut and Cirrus materializes a book and begins the ritual, ending by throwing a glowing bead of crystal into the air that expands rapidly to create a dome of opaque white, 10 feet in radius.

The group piles into the dome, the opaque exterior allowing entry to all who Cirrus designates.

The inside is plush, with cushions, blankets and rugs covering the floor and a small fire in the center in an iron brazier.

Uncomfortably though the roof of the dome, though transparent from the inside, has a fresco seemingly painted on the ceiling.  That of a…"tasteful" nude of cirrus himself.

The group halts momentarily, dismay spreading over their faces and Patches simply turns and walks out of the dome, deciding to scout the Sanctum a bit.

As Patches leaves, Tark proclaims that Cirrus' nudity is "looking at him" and "follows" him like creepy eyes in a painting.

Buumi has a chat with Cirrus and remarks that venerating oneself over that of the god he worships may lead him down the wrong path.

Thinking that he may be on to something, Cirrus transforms the mural into what he imagines Selune to look like - a pale, silver haired, buxom human woman tastefully obfuscated in white silk.

Buumi heads out to follow Patches but waits at the door, calling into the darkness for Patches to return…

Patches leaves the dome and heads into the Sanctum, pulling the cowl of her Piwafwi up and descending down the dark steps.

As her eyes adjust, she gets a sense of familiarity harkening back to her time In the Underdark, her dark vision painting the world in shades of grey and easily allowing her to see all the way to the back of the main chamber.

Ahead, the stairs end and a hallway begins with four statues spaced ten feet apart.

For a moment, Patches thinks she sees a flash of purple in the middle of the hallway, between the statues.

Further down, past the hall into a large chamber, she can see an Obsidian obelisk in an otherwise unremarkable chamber.

Heading down to where she saw the purple glint, Patches inspects the area but finds nothing.

Not trusting this place, she takes a few steps back and then runs and jumps, running along the wall and past the section of the hallway she suspects to be trapped.

Landing on the other side, she crouches down and waits, seeing if anything happens.

Just then she hears Buumi call out from behind her, asking her to return to the dome.

Patches looks around and out of the corner of her eye, spots movement in the darkest shades of grey in her vision.

Knowing that something is out there, she turns, climbs back past the statues and reunites with Buumi at the stairs and they both head back into the Dome.
  

**A Much needed rest**

Inside the comfortably warm dome, the group settles in for a long rest.

Buumi cooks while Tark makes smores, cirrus meditates and prays to Selune, Fey and Megno study their spellbooks, Patches tinkers with her gear (and tries a bit of praying herself) while Gundren works on tuning up Gwen.

Eventually, the group settles in and gets some much needed rest.
  

Tark falls asleep soundly, but quickly finds himself dreaming vividly.

Dreaming of the Monastery, much like when he met Gaddock recently in the dreamscape, Tark realizes that another of these spells has been cast, though this time he is the recipient.

Expecting his master, Tark makes his way through the mountaintop Monastery, walking the garden route that he and his old master took long ago.

Descending to the reflecting pools that overlook the vast mountain range and forests below, Tark sees an unknown figure sitting beneath a cherry tree.

Approaching Tark sees a comfortably overweight man with eastern features, white silken hair and a long beard.

The man looks up and smiles, laugh lines and wrinkles creasing his old face.  The old man introduces himself as Kenshi, the man who saved Gaddock.

Tark and Kenshi talk for a while in the dreamscape of the Monastery. 

Tark thanks the old man and asks about him and his past and discovers that Kenshi hails from Kara-Tur and has spend time in Faerun before.

Notably, Kenshi has spent time in Thay and Damara though he never made it to the Monastery of the Yellow Rose himself, though he wishes he had.

Kenshi lets Tark know that Gaddock is recovering well and that they will do all they can to fight the sickness spreading in The Bloodstone Lands.

Tark is thankful and reassured.

Kenshi goes on to teach Tark a technique that might help him, the ability to project ones Ki into a target to learn about another.

They spend the next eight hours in the dreamscape practicing the technique and Tark picks it up quickly, impressing Kenshi.

As the dream ends, Kenshi tells Tark that he will stay in touch.
  

The group awakens in the dome, the spell nearing its completion and the group goes about packing up, making a quick meal and then exiting the dome before the collected snow is dumped on them as the spell ends.

Fey makes it out just in time.

Assembling around the entrance, the group looks into the darkness. 

Night swirls around them and snow lazily drifts down.

It is past midnight and ten days remain before they are to be at Helm's Hold.

They enter the Sanctum of Krasus.

 **Descent into Darkness
**  

Descending the stairs, Patches warns the group about the suspected trap and indeed, Gundren and Fey both note a Glyph on the floor.

Pushing mentally against the Glyph, Fey manages to shatter its magic and remove the trap that would have awoken the statues as gargoyles.

Fey inspects the dark stone walls and notes that every surface is covered in the same arcane runes and script as the door, weathered from millennia of neglect.

The group presses on, into the main chamber housing the Obsidian Obelisk.

Patches moves up to try and get a look down the only other passage leading from the main chamber.

Everyone else moves up to the Obelisk and as they do so, an electrical charge surges up its length and a lightning bolt is launched at the entry to the Sanctum.

The group dives back, the electricity burning them and as they step back from the Obelisk, the shadows themselves in the room reach out with dark claws to rake at them.

Four shadows attack.

The animate shadows leech the life force from Tark, sapping his strength and he yells in sudden pain.

Patches spins, aiming her pistol and firing a series of shots at the insubstantial creatures. The bullets crumple and tumble, seemingly hitting the insubstantial shadowstuff.

With firebolts, Eldritch blasts and Gundren going a little crazy with his axe, the four shadows are dispatched quickly, though not without some damage to the group.

Cirrus touches Tarks face and kisses him on the forehead, casting Greater Restoration on his little friend and returning his strength.

Warily, the group fans out around the chamber, moving with utmost care.

As they pass the Obelisk, on the back they find a glowing diamond embedded just as Fey finds a hidden switch on the far wall and presses it with a Mage hand.

With a click, the gemstone falls out of the Obelisk and they know the Lightning bolt trap has been disarmed.

They move in to better inspect the Obelisk and find that it has four slots, each with a symbol: A Sun, Snowflake, Flower and Eye.

Cirrus, Gundren and Fey theorize that the symbols represent the schools of magic as in ancient times there were four.

Around the whole set of slots and symbols is a pentagram contained within a cirlce - the symbol of ancient Netheril.

Investigating the rest of the room, the group finds another switch in the dark granite wall and press it, opening a hidden door to a large storage room.

The furniture has long since disintegrated and everything once held here is in dusty tatters.  Inspecting the area, Patches finds a number of ancient gold coins (marked with the pentagram of Netheril) and gemstones in ruined remains of coats and pouches.

At the back of the storage chamber they find a set of stairs descending forty feet and encrusted in ice.  A cellar.
  

Heading back to the main chamber, frost and ancient dust crunching under foot, the group approaches the large hall leading deeper into the complex.

Twenty feet wide and forty long, the group sees a set of double door down at the far end, gleaming and made of solid gold, flanked by two robed statues wielding staffs.

Cautiously the group heads toward the doors, keeping their eyes peeled.

Tark is in the lead as Patches is returning from the storage chamber when the air distorts in front of the Monk and he cant stop himself in time.

Walking through a crystallization of time and space, it rakes at Tarks body and mind and the group watches as he grows younger by 10 years, reverting him to 11 years of age.

Tark stumbles, blood streaming out of his nose and the shimmering magic shatters around him, his body breaking the bubble of magic.

The group rushes to Tarks side, astounded by what they just saw.

Fey reaches out with his arcane senses and confirms that Tark just walked through a distortion of time and space and can feel that this place has more of these bubbles.

Cirrus throws up his hands in frustration, exclaiming how incredibly dangerous this place is and does not understand why they are here.

Megno responds that he paid them and Tark that they need weapons to fight Zhengyi.

They ensure Tark is ok to continue and press on to the golden door after they determine the statues are not gargoyles or golems.
  

At the golden door, Fey discovers an arcane lock and pushes past it easily disarming it and the golden doors swing inward.

And a lance of fire shoots out, grazing Fey as he dives into cover, spotting a floating creature with four eyestalks and a central eye floating near the ceiling of the hallway on the other side of the door.

The hallway appears to be a junction, with two staircases rising off either side and another set of golden double doors at the far end.

The Spectator (recognized by Fey) darts up one of the staircases and out of sight, Patches and Tark moving in and taking cover in the hallway.

As the group congregates at the open Golden doors, Fey spots a Glyph on the ground just on the inside of the door and recognizes a Glyph of Radiant Sickness but that it would only be triggered by Aberrations, Fiends or Undead. A defense of some kind.

Patches pokes her head around the corner and looks up the stairs where the Spectator flew, seeing a landing 10ft up with a statue of a woman holding a vase and then another set of stairs. The Spectator is floating up there and shoots two eye beams at her, and she dodges the first but is paralyzed by the second.

Buumi rushes forward and his protective aura allows Patches to push past the paralysis.

Tark rushes in and with Fey's firebolts, Cirrus' eldritch blasts and a flying knee from the monk, the creature is obliterated in short order.
  

Not wanting to head up the stairs just yet, the group investigates the second set of Golden doors.

Patches takes out her Black-Powder kit for this one and blows the lock - this time a mechanical one.

The door opens from the force, just enough for Patches to look inside and see four small orbs, much like the Spectator but tiny, floating near the ceiling.  Looking around the room, she spies numerous piles of refuse, ancient tables and moldering chairs.  She sees doors leading off this grand hall and around the place four murals stand out as splashes of color against the dark stone.  She spies four gargoyle statues arrayed around the room and just as she begins to turn away, notes many of the refuse piles moving toward the door.

Patches closes the door and relays all she saw.

The group arrays themselves for a fight, with Gwen charging her lightning blast.

Patches opens the door and the blast rockets forth, destroying all of the little Beholder-kin and scorching the oozing creatures.

The strange creatures form mouths all over their bodies and begin letting out gibbering wails, assailing Patches mind and spitting blazing balls of goo that explode, blinding several people.

The group backs up, using their firepower to whittle the strange creatures down as they slowly move along the ground, reality itself seeming to become doughy and malleable around the odd creatures.

Cirrus slams his staff down and calls upon a wall of force to block the creatures.

The moment he does though, a hum and flash from behind them in the entry chamber distracts them and they turn to see a shimmering wall of force not from Cirrus.  Rushing back, they see that the wall has trapped them inside the Sanctum and some kind of Magical dampening field has been enacted, preventing any spell higher than level 2 from being cast…

The Obelisk appears to be the thing generating the wall of force and dampening field and as they inspect it again, they see a large crack running through it.  Feeling the energies within the monument, the group realizes that eventually the energy will reach a critical mass and detonate.

They estimate about 11 hours before this happens.

They also guess that the marked slots in the Obelisk are for some manner of key to disarm the thing.

The group turns back and engages the Gibbering Mouthers, aberrations from beyond the Prime Material Plane. The group unleashes their fury at the creatures, blasting them and cutting them apart in moments as the creatures try to bite and tangle with the group.

The aberrations are summarily destroyed and the group looks ahead, into the grand hall, now clear of enemies…
