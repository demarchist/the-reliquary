The group is surrounded by a dozen assailants and arrows begin to fly in at the unsuspecting group!

The halflings are small, pale and covered in mud.  They are adorned with skulls and grisly trophies and they are all visibly and badly Corrupted.

The group is shocked and many of them take multiple arrow hits.

A black skull is lobbed into the middle of the party and it explodes in a wave of Corruption, covering Buumi the worst.

Gundren gets splattered just as he leaps onto Arkto and he finds himself poisoned and feeling ill.

The Owlbear takes into the sky, but the Halfling archers track it, letting loose arrow after arrow

Arkto howls in pain but climbs even higher to escape the arrows.

Everyone was surprised, save for Feanon, who quickly begins retaliating against the Halfling assailants with blasts of fire and devastating singularities.

The battle erupts in full as the initial assault fails to overwhelm the party and they strike back.

Tark spots a shaman and shadowsteps to him, asking why they are attacking.

The Shaman responds that the group is to be the new sacrifice to Hohonu Hāmau

Tark doesnt like the sound of that, and disagrees by kicking the Shaman in the face.

The Halfling loose their corrupted arrows and lob exploding skulls into the group, but with the momentum of the Ambush spent, the battle turns against them quickly

The group slaughters the corrupted Halflings in the counterattack.

Tark intentionally keeps two of the halflings alive and two others are charmed and stop attacking.

A fifth flees into the swamp, but when Tark pursues, he watches the body being dragged into the water by tangling vines and he turns away.

The group gathers around their captives, intent on learning why these strange and hostile halflings attacked them.

Two are unconscious so they interrogate the two charmed Halflings

They discover that these halflings are a tribal people, they live nearby and worship a great creature named Hohonu Hāmau.

Cirrus was spoken to by this creature when he cast a charm spell on some of the other attackers, he heard a voice telling him to back off.

Cirrus believes that whatever this creature it, it may be powerful enough to form pacts and indeed, the corruption on these halflings is not the same as the other villagers, it is more potent, more virulent but with seemingly no downside for the host.

The Halflings claim it as the blessing of their dark god.

The group cleanses them of this corruption, forcefully.

The halflings wail and cry to be separated from their god, and rather than be grateful for being cleansed, but begin to try and re-infect themselves in the name of Hohonu.

Buumi asks them that if they were to be freed to live their lives, would they still worship Hohonu and seek to sacrifice the group and others to the beast?

They say that they will, that their god demands it in order to survive to coming fading of this world.

Tark makes a case to save them, that they are halflings like himself that can be cleansed.  Cirrus agrees, knowing full well the lure of pact magic and the influence of these entities.

Buumi talks with the captives some more, but comes away convinced that leaving them alive while traveling through this swamp could prove fatal to his friends.  

He backs away conflicted but turns to Gundren and nods.

As the group is arguing about saving the Halflings and ridding them of this influence vs killing enemies that could cause trouble in this woefully dangerous environment; Gundren shoots them both dead, putting the debate to rest.

Tark is stricken and furiously begins shouting at the group that murdered the two captives, admonishing them for their callousness and haste.

Gundren turns away, uninterested and unaffected, but Buumi begins to look unsure, and then ashamed.

They keep the other two halflings alive but tightly bound and gagged.

The group wraps up their short rest and then they set off again, trekking through Thueba Swamp.

After two hours or so, several of the group in the air, spot movement a little ways further into the Swamp

They see a Caravan of more Halflings, though these ones wear similar clothing and are painted in mud, they lack the horrific and grisly trophies and are walking in the open, seemingly making no effort to hide themselves.

The group decides that after the last batch of murderous halflings, they will hide and let Tark be the one to meet this group. 

Halfling to Halfling, despite the cultural differences.

The group spots and approaches Tark and after a tense introduction, it becomes clear that this group is friendly

The rest of the party comes out of hiding and the leader of the halflings; **Camea** says that they have been looking for a group of Foreigners in the area and they hoped to find them before their dark brethren did

The group shows Camea their captives and the Shaman laments that these are worshippers of the dark entity Hohonu and that their violence is unfortunately the new norm for her people.

She offers to take over stewardship of the prisoners, saying that they will be treated well, but laments that their deaths are likely inevitable, sooner rather than later. 

She says that for many months now, the Abyss Walkers have taken control of her people, sacrificing many to their Dark god, seeking to awaken it from its ancient slumber (a dark god that is NOT Zalaam or Vecna it seems).

The Abyss Walkers have been a part of the tribe for untold ages, gaining in power and influence as the world has grown darker and more chaotic.

With the new schism in the tribe, the followers of the old ways, which she is the priestess for, are forced to hide their true allegiances and lay low.

Camea hopes to change this and asks the Outlanders if they could help her prevent the awakening of Hohonu.

The group is non-commital, but they do not like the sound of this powerful entity, perhaps powerful enough to create Pact Magic.

The group and the halflings decide to rest for the night and with Camea leading them to a safer location, they set up a decent camp for the night where the insects will not bother them.

They spend the night swapping stories and the halflings are fascinated and terrified by the Outlanders use of metal (especially for something as mundane as cooking).

Both groups awake early, the night’s watch having gone smoothly and treat themselves to some of Buumi’s cooking.

They break camp, looking to head further West, in the direction of the supposed Machina factory, and the domain of the halflings, known as** ‘****Ā****ina Pulu**.
