The group finds themselves back in the Barony.

Tark, who had left the group back in the etablishment is moving into the Town Center when a portal opens.

The slaves that were freed in Menzoberranzan and led away by the Bregan D’Aerthe scouts pour forth, Red Slaad on their tail.

Tark engages both Slaad just as the group rushes from the Establishment having heard the commotion.

Once all the freed slaves are through the portal, it is sealed off by a Wall of Force and then dismissed by the caster - Kimmuriel.

Three Slaad are subdued and taken to Feanon’s Tower and a rider is dispatched to the Manufactory to construct Adamantine cages for the beasts.

Townsfolk begin to refer to Feanon’s Tower as the *Tower of Slumber*

The group has the newly freed slaves seen to by Li and the local Paladins.

30 end up staying in Kossenberg.

10 Woodelves head into the Moonwood to join the clans there

The rest head out along the Tradeway

Mark, one of Kossenbergs town elders swears that the town will assist these folk in building houses should they wish to stay, and supplies should they wish to move on.

Of the sixty freed slaves, twenty are nearly comatose, barely accepting their turn of events, or crying in happiness half of the rest hear the sall of Selune from Cirrus and head toward the Fane for shelter.  The rest head into Over the Moon having been promised free lodging and food for the week by Patches.

Tark looks suspiciously at his friends, worried they are taking advantage of the desperate folk, but all he sees is sincerity.  Maybe his friends are not all bad.

The guard response to the Underdark incursion was rapid and if the group had not stopped the Slaad so quickly, the guards would surely have moments later.

With the crowds controlled and dispersing, the group turns to the Bregan D’Aerthe Drow and find them to all be disguised as overly handsome elves and humans.  They move into the Establishment and head down to gamble against the Dwarves.

The group notices more people of character hanging around the barony - proto-adventurers and level 1’s drawn to the group’s rapidly expanding barony.

Kimmuriel sits with the group and explains what happened after they had last met.

Menzoberranzan is in chaos

Vizeron attacked the larger city

Presents the Clay Urn Vizeron enchanted to continually dispense Sickening fog

Vizeron used a ritual to siphon a great deal of energy and captured it, somehow and then fled.

He had a veritable army of Slaad under his control.

Cirrus tries to recruit Kimmuriel who rejects Selune, but accepts a dwelling in the Barony as a gift (and to use as a Bregan Safe House, to be known as the Twilight Lodge).

Kimmuriel is invited to Feanon’s Tower, he accepts.

Tark invites Kimmuriel to come swimming at the local dock. He does not respond.

As Kimmuriel turns to take his leave, Tark once again reminds the Drow of the invitation, as does Feanon.

Patches asks the Drow Psionicist about Jarlaxle’s escapades and is told that it was successful, in Jarlaxle’s favor.

Patches takes this to mean that Tiago Baenre has potentially fallen in battle.

The Psionicist leaves and the group is left to their own devices.

Patches then turns to the group and offers to answer any and all questions from the group, honestly, as a show of good faith and trust.

The group questions her about Tiago, having a kid and her like of Buumi.

Patches goes to take Finn on a tour of the Barony, showing Finn both towers in the area.

Tark heads north to go for a walk.

Feanon returns to his tower to prepare for the arrival of **Lady Avelyere and prepare another Clone**

Cirrus heads to his Fane with Finna and Patches to see to the newly arrived refugees, talking to each before moving into his inner sanctum to yodel, pray.

Finn expresses some concern about his safety in the Barony from Vladalma.

Patches asks if Cirrus could take them to Svartalfheim.

Cirrus agrees after he has rested.

A number of the refugees have smaller wounds from the Slaad

Cirrus sees to their wounds.

Tark comes across two kids poking at a badger den with a stick, he ends up giving the kids his magical staff and checks the hole himself, finding a pregnant badger.

Tark moves the kids off to leave the badger alone but the kid takes the staff with him, Tark needing to pick it up later.

He wanders over to the docks, as he does, Feanon visits the monk as a gaseous form.

Feanon gives Tark a wand and then leaves.

Patches takes Finn into Feanons tower to properly introduce the young Drow to her Wizard friend.

Finn resolves that he will learn enough to defend himself rather than relying on others.

They enter the tower and head up to the lab to meet Fey.

Feanon is taken out of his contemplations by a knock on his lab door.

He opens it and sees a man he has not met before who introduces himself as the new Janitor -** Stason Jatham**

Feanon eyes the man uneasily, figuring out pretty quickly that this man is **The Last Mindslayer, **brought by Patches to keep an eye on the Wizard and...clean up.

Patches and Finn pass by Stason on their way in.

Patches and Stason ignore one another and Patches walks into Feanons lab with Finn.

Finn and Feanon speak about apprenticeship 

Finn is intrigued and talks to Patches about joining Feanon’s Tower but is non-committal

Across the Barony, Tark is relaxing at the old dock.

With no Kimmuriel in sight, he heads back to Over the Moon and heads down into the basement.

Below, he finds Kimmuriel amongst the crowd of gamblers and convinces the Drow to come with him back to the Old Dock by the lake.

At the dock, Tark dives below the waters, a curious Drow following with magic.

Tark returns to the surface with a box and begins to pull out an eclectic mix of items - magical weapons, mundane buttons, and wondrous items.

Kimmuriel is puzzled by Tark and the Monk begins to speak about his friends and their accomplishments - singing their praises.

The Drow takes his leave from the curious monk, leaving Tark to enjoy the sunset.

Over at the keep, Patches visits Buumi and asks for his help in talking to Tark.

As they walk to find the Monk, she asks Buumi about the arranged marriage and the debutante ball and hears that he is rather unenthusiastic about the whole affair but is cagey as to why, blushing as he looks at Patches.

After about an hour, Tark’s reverie is interrupted by Patches and Buumi arriving at the lakeside.

As the sun sets, Patches apologizes to Tark for lying to him and promises to never lie to him again.  Though she’s pretty sure she’ll mess up from time to time, she promises that if Tark asks, she will answer truthfully.

Tark still feels bad, like he’s being tricked into doing bad things by his friends.

Buumi though points toward the Barony - bustling with freed slaves and refugees and points out that the group has done good in the world.

Can they do better? Yes, and they should strive to do so.

Tark is mollified, somewhat.

They stay up to the wee hours of the morning talking on the lakeshore under the shining moon.


At dawn, they are woken by Cirrus on the shores of the lake, Cirrus exclaiming that he is ready for The Journey.

They return to the main barony and collect the group for a “Cirrus-cation”, stopping by Ivan the baker for breakfast.

Before heading off, Tark heads to Kossenburg to pick up his staff from Ben, the 8 year old child, giving him the Wand of Lightning bolts in exchange.

He then stops by Gundren’s Manufactory to pick up Gundren, but he’s busy and shoos off Tark

Cirrus then Planeshifts the group to **Svartalfheim**.

The group finds themselves split from one another with everyone except for Patches and Finn in a black marble waiting room adorned with Onyx furniture.

Patches and Finn find themselves in an office across an Onyx desk from a Drow man in white flowing robes.

He introduces himself as **Magistrate Delroy.**

His skin is a plum color, with vibrant pink eyes and bluish hair.

The black marble of the architecture is threaded through with silver and mithril.

Delroy inquires about the origin of Patches and Finn and points out that neither of them are dead and hail from Toril and the Lolthsworn city of Menzoberranzan.

He complains that they bring the **Curse of Wendonai to the city of Dokkar**.

Patches makes a case that at least one of them should be allowed into the city and offers that she leaves and that Finn be allowed to stay in the city.

Delroy mulls it over and nods, he agrees that they can both stay in the first level of the city and the **Penitent Gardens **while he discusses Patches proposal with the elders.

So further drive the point home that she is a follower of Elistraee and NOT Lolthsworn, Patches summons Eclipse as a beam of moonlight and quicksilver.

Delroy is taken aback and takes note, swearing that Patches and Finn are both here as his guests and under his protection.

Patches goes on, trying to sweeten the pot by offering information on Lolths plans in the wider cosmos.

Patches and Finn leave Delroy’s office and rejoins the group who are waiting immediately outside.

The group gathers in the waiting room and Patches tells them of the situation.

Cirrus is VERY smug, having brought the group to **Dokkar**

Cirrus looks past Patches to Delroy and approaches the Drow magistrate.

They talk, with Delroy noting that each of them are Primes with their original bodies.

Tark asks how old he is and Delroy mentions that he is a long, long dead Elf and as a Magistrate here, is not affiliated with any clan.

Delroy welcomes the group to Dokkar and the first few rings of the city.

The group follows Cirrus and they head out into the gleaming city of the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim.

As they look around, the group sees Elves, Dwarves and beings of every type, though the population is predominantly Drow.

Patches and Finn both get stares from passers by.

She returns their stares and even goes so far as to juggle her knives to show off and wow onlookers.

Feanon and Patches verbally spar until Cirrus asks them to stop fighting and enjoy the city.

At the base of the shining Citadel, the group looks up and sees the many tiers of the white marble city ascending up to the ceiling of a massive cavern, the roof is bisected by a gash that opens the ceiling up to the stars of the heavens.

Here, in the plane of Ysgard, the group looks in awe upon the realm of Elistraee, goddess of moonlight.
