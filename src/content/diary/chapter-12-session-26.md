The group continues their debate with the Speaker, tension is high

A voice cuts through the scene and the local guards, known as the Wardens, start to break up the crowd and mediate the situation

The Wardens are led by a scarred, female tabaxi who calls out the Speaker named Sebek to stop his preaching as it is disturbing the peace

The tabaxi and wardens disperse the crowd away, about half of them leave the plaza with the Cultist of the Black Skull.

The tabaxi warden captain turns to talk with the group and introduces herself as Ime, asking for statements from them on what occurred. 

Most of the group start to talk with Ime and learn she is one of the Usurpers of Rudjek - Tark and Gundren, however, start to move through the crowd of cultists leaving the plaza. The two are hot on the heels of the Speaker.

As Gundren moves forwards, he opens a Bag of Holding revealing Gwen and the crowd cowers in absolute terror at the Machina: Gundren dashes toward the departing Speaker

Then, out of nowhere though, Gundren is stabbed in the back.

Tark immediately spots the assassin, darting towards the dark figure to pursue. Gwen too has acquired the target and the two converge on the hapless assassin: they both pin the cultist.

Buumi rushes away from Ime towards his friends and heals them as well as the group; Ime and some Wardens move through the dispersing crowd, toward the glittering metal lion and small halfling both grappling a dark hooded figure.

After a long winded conversation, the Warden tabaxi gets statements from the heroes and arrests the man for attempted murder. The group asks Ime if they can interrogate the assassin before he is taken, she agrees and they find an abandoned location questioning. 

During the interrogation, the group conveys the danger of the assassin and that he, as well as the Speaker, are undead. Ime is shocked by this information, and must find out for herself where Sebek has ran off to and begins to question the cultist.

She discovers that many of the cultists are indeed undead, and that they plan to take over the city and they have headquarters somewhere in the Harbor District. 

She ends the interrogation with a flurry of invisible punches to the cultist, killing him. She takes a deep breath and a wave of magical energy exudes from her, revealing two astral arms.

Tark is impressed by the tabaxi’s control of her Ki.  It is unlike anything he has ever seen or felt, yet it resonates with him.

He estimates her to be a decent opponent, though no match for any of his own group, but worthy of respect.

Ime turns to the group and informs them that Liara warned them the cult was more than it seemed a few months ago.  

Ime says Liara went to the Red Hills to find Kamuzu Isa and find proof of her theory on the cult being led by powerful undead, and returned only recently with Djoser as well as some pretty crazy stories.

The group corroborates several of the stories and then informs Ime that they must find Djoser.

Ime tells them that Djoser is in the Brickyard of the Smith District organizing **The Expedition to the Spelljammer** and gives directions and walks with the heroes for a bit.

The group thanks Ime for her help, she tells them that she will be at the southwest corner of the plaza near the Arena of Iyum if they need her and heads off.

The heroes move west through the city and they find themselves moving through the meeting points of two districts.

The ancient road through the heart of the city is flanked by the remains of truly ancient and giant structures, now divided into smaller residences and places of business.

Each side of the street has a distinct look, reinforced by one being mostly new stone construction and the other being wood and mud brick.

Ahead appears to be another marketplace; though a bit more industrial in nature and the group peruses the wares of the souk.

Buumi purchases himself a new suit of carapace armor, finally covering all his sunburns.

JmJm stops by a tailor and purchases a fantastic outfit to match his turban. He is not happy with the colors of his new armor, and seeks pigments to dye them to fit his attire. 

The heroes run into a large square with hundreds of dried pigments in tins. Jmjm eventually finds what he is looking for and gets his new armored dyed green and blues: making him look classy.

The group then heads west, through the titanic city wall and out into the proper industrial quarter of the city.

Not quite a slum, but quite dirty, the place smells of smoke and dust and the sounds of industry are ever present.

In a nearby clearing near a quarry under a pavilion and surrounded by palettes of brick, the group spots Djoser conversing with a human man in noble attire. They both are overlooking a map and one or two Medjai of the Ranger variant can be seen lingering nearby.

The Hammer of Nuraz is strapped across Djoser’s back, the raw titanium glittering in the afternoon light.

He looks up as the veritable crowd of outlanders, including the lion Machina, approaches and he frowns and shakes his head a little.

He greets the group amicably though and welcomes them to the city of Iyum.

He gestures to the human man with them and introduces him as Nazim of Ras Alkan**.**

Nazim greets the group, but must take his leave to deal with preparing for the expedition.  The two Wardens follow the man, leaving Djoser with the group.

The group begins to chat. Djoser says he will hear what they have to say over drinks and he takes them to a nearby cantina.

The group settles in around a cluster of tables, with Djoser at the head, and they begin to tell him their tale.

The group assures Djoser of their goal in defeating the evil that plagues the land.

He believes them.

They then move on to general stories and decide to have a drinking contest

Several hours go by and night has long since fallen by the time the group is done.

Djoser nods his head, a bit drunkenly at this point, he is convinced.

He says he will allow the group to cast the spell of Arcane Recall on his hammer.

Feanon moves to stand, their work here done, when Patches perks up from the shadows.

She hears something just as some of the others in the group sense it too.

Before long, they all hear a rhythmic chanting and the ground begins to tremble.

They then smell a fetid stench of unwashed and ill masses.

The group moves to the front doo as they hear the chant “**ALHAMDU ZALAAAAAM!” **from a thousand throats.

Out in the streets, a mob has formed.

A hoard of peasants, brandishing torches, makeshift weapons and even stones, have amassed and they seem intent on the small Cantina.

From atop a nearby building, a crooked and bowed figure stands, backlit by the small moon of this world.

*he blighted fanatics start to raise their arms as they chant, turning the hymn into a battle cry as they all start yelling, screaming and preparing for a fight. At the top of one of the roofs surrounded by fanatics stands a feeble man wrapped in linen bandages, cloaked in a black shawl lined with shells and topaz gems: it is **Sebek**, the **Speaker of the Black Skull** from the plaza. He looks to the group and says, “I told you this was not over, the citizens of Iyum do not want you here anymore. Leave this city, or die by the hands of Zalaam’s worshippers: you cannot kill all of us.”*

Gundren throws down Arkto and summons his friend, hopping on and readying his weapon.

As he does though, the Speaker cackles and casts a Dispel, unraveling the magic of the Mount.

Gundren looks down in disbelief for only a moment, before spitting and shouldering his rifle.

Gwen steps up next to him and prepares to maul any that approach.

The more goodhearted of the group protest, and turn their eyes upon the approaching peasants.  

Cirrus and Feanon work out that the crowd is being mind controlled by the sickness of the Corruption, a spell of Vecnas that covers the land.

This mob is only the beginning, as Vecnas will waxes, the sickness will spread and the people will become enslaved…

JmJm, Feanon and Cirrus each cast spells into the approaching crowd, causing hundreds to drop unconscious, and unharmed to the ground…

Only to be run over by the hoard behind them.

Gundren shrugs, cocks his rifle and moves to shoot the nearest approaching person.

The crowd begins to pick up steam in a charge, and Buumi manages to sense some of the undead in the crowds.

Tark shadowsteps to the Speaker and attacks the man, who is protected by powerful magic.

As Tark attacks, striking at Mirror Image illusions, an assassin moves out from the crowd around the Speaker.

The dark cloaked figure stabs Tark brutally in the back, twisting the knife and then darts into the confusing mob.

Tark staggers, bleeding badly.
