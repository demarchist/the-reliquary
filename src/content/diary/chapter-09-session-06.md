The Wormlike beast slithers forward, assaulting the nearby Duergar.

It belches a great gout of acid across the Dark Dwarves and the Duergar scream in pain.

One by one, the psionically stunned Duergar are roped by tendrils and brought into the gaping maws of one of the three “heads” of the thing.

Each Duergar is consumed and the group watches in disgust as the bodies can be seen sliding down the translucent throats.

The group leaps into action with Tark and Cirrus joining the battle as a badly injured Snorbul and overwhelmed Thorna back off (Thorna attending to the Deep Gnome).

Patches circles wide, trying to guage the beast and not provide it any clear shots for its acid belch or Psionic blast.

She tosses a fireball at it as Gundren begins to fall back, leapfrogging with Feanon and laying down fire.

Firebolts hiss into its mucus covered hide and Thundercannon shells explode against it.

Cirrus begins to release eldritch blasts and a Wall of fire is thrown down to burn the creature.

The assault from the group is intense, but the beast is newly awoken and energized.

It vomits another deluge of acid, but this time the recently consumed Duergar are ejected and hurled at the group.

They land in puddles of oozing acid and begin to rise, changed and malformed.

The mutated Duergar attack.

Tark gets behind the creature and begins to assault it, only to then be caught in a Telekenetic grip and crushed.

Cirrus thrusts his Abyssal Fork into the creature and with a flash of light, the creature is plane-shifted to the abyss.

A few seconds goes by and the group breathes a sigh of relief.

No sooner have they done so then another flash of light and rush of displaced air alerts them and the beast re-appears.

It Plane-shifted itself back...

Cirrus is shocked and struggles as tentacles reach out to bind him and he too is restrained.

The Warlock and Monk struggle but are enveloped by the creature as it tries to devour them.

Seeing his friends in danger, Doc B calls to the earth and great pillars of stone erupt from the ground to smash at the worm-creature.

As all this is happening, the group hears the worms melodic voice in their heads, begging them to join “Quil’Sygoth and the family of Halashnar”.

The names mean nothing to the group, but Feanon recognizes something familiar about the creature.

It reeks of the Illithid brine pools.  

Though unsure of the connection, he is certain that this worm is related to the Mindflayers.

Still being burned by the wall of fire and now with two prey in its gullet, the worm levitates up and away from the fire, undulating through the air like a bizarre eel.

Patches attempts to Faerie fire the thing, but its inherent magic resistance overcomes the Drow magic.

Frustrated, Patches unleashes a Ring of Fire and it dispells a nearby Duergar’s invisibility.

Wanting answers, the Rogue rushes the Duergar, paralyzes him and proceeds to hogtie the poor Dwarf.

Meanwhile the fight continues to rage with the Worm across the cavern.

Cirrus is forced to use the Tomb of Levisticus to stop himself being digested by the aberration, while Tark takes two poisoned daggers and begins to hack at the esophagus holding him.

The Worm throws up Tark as he cuts at its vulnerable insides.

On the exterior, Gundren, Feanon, Doc, Patches and Gwen begin to focus their fire on each “head” of the beast.

One by one the life is blasted from each, but the heads quickly regenerate.

Understanding what needs to be done, Tark pulls himself from the bile of the creature and waits for his opening.

The creature, with some semblance of intelligence attempts to flee, but the group is having none of it.

Gundren blasts away, destroying two heads and gives Tark the opening he was waiting for.

The Monk leaps at the last injured head, plunging a fist into it’s flesh, then leaps to the main body.

The final blow lands on the main body, rupturing its abdomen and it falls dead to the ground, spilling the contents of its belly across the cavern floor.

The place reeks of viscera and salty brine.

From its belly spills a dozen mutated corpses, more lithe than the changed Duergar.

A few seconds go by and the creature begins to stir again.

The group surrounds it and quickly kill it again.

A few more moments go by and once again it begins to stir.

The group takes up position and keep it from properly regenerating, but they are at a loss.

How is this thing not dying!?

Patches shows up with her prisoner and a quick interrogation reveals that the Duergar knew nothing of this creature, they were just here for the Chardalyn deposits.

The group reads the Duergar letter they found earlier and it confirms the intent to mine the Chardalyn.

The letter also mentions a**nother mine to the Far North**, past the **Spine of the World** and near the **Lost City of Snow**.

Though none of the party know specifics, **Icewind Dale** comes to mind as a place to being looking for such a mine, or at the very least, more **Duergar miners of Clan Sunblight**.

The worm stirs, Gundren’s cannon belches fire and Gwens claws rake.

Feanon has the group bring the Sarcophagus over and he examines it as Patches and Gundren sift through the remains from the creature’s belly.

Among the changed corpses, they realize that they were elves, long, long ago.

They find several magical items amongst the long dead elves including: A Well of Many Worlds, Dust of Dryness, a healing potion, Dust of Disappearance and a beautiful and supremely sharp elven blade.

Examining the Sarcophagus, Feanon translates the ancient elvish incribed in the stone: “*Restrained herein is a Devoured Changed of the Pallid Prince Halashnar; ****Quil'sygoth****- She who feasts”*

As the group examines the Sarcophagus and keeps Quil’Sygoth from regenerating, Patches thinks about recruiting the Duergar for Veygar and returns to her prisoner (being watched over by Cirrus).

As she approaches (Tark approaching at the same moment) she thinks she hears a muffled call for help...and then nothing.

Arriving by Cirrus with Tark, she notes that the Duergar is gone.

Tark and Patches both question Cirrus, but the Warlock lies convincingly that the Duergar escaped.

In fact, he fed the poor Duergar to his bag of devouring and Patches heard his call for help before his death.

Frustrated that the Duergar “escaped” Patches turns and heads to the hole the Duergar extracted the Sarcophagus from and Cirrus follows shortly after.

Patches arrives first and descends into the hole, noting a half dozen Duergar mining constructs beneath her, idle in dirty water roughly a foot deep.

The sheer sides of the hole appear to be made of compressed rubble and patches begins to descend.

As cirrus approaches, he is warned to be quiet by an illusion of Patches.

The two of them investigate the Duergar constructs and patches recognizes them as Hammerers and Screamers - Mortally wounded or punished Duergar grafted into suits of armor and reduced to mindless laborers.

They are useless to the group without them being re-imprinted and there are no surviving Duergar to do it.

Cirrus releases a Synaptic Static and the creatures fall dead with a splash into the water.

Patches continues down into the hole.

There she finds a single deposit of Chardalyn, a 15lb shard discarded in the Duergars haste to raise the massive sarcophagus.  She takes it for herself.

Then she begins to look around.

Back at the sarcophagus and the reconstituting corpse of Quil’Sygoth, Feanon gives in and agrees that they must re-imprison the worm in the Sarcophagus.

They haul the corpse  of the creature a short way to the Chardalyn Sarcophagus and much to their relief, the crystal device practically draws the creature inside once it has started to be placed into it.

They slide the lid back across and the Sarcophagus seals, enacting its stasis magic.

With the threat dealt with, they all head to where Patches and Cirrus went, all save Feanon who remains with the box.

Alone, Feanon scribes a teleportation sigil around the Sarcophagus and transports it to his tower...he then follows the group to investigate the hole.

With the whole group now around the Duergar “mining shaft” they being to investigate it thoroughly, hoping that it is the tip of an ancient elven city.

The hole paints a different, though no less intriguing story.

The ancient elves collapsed the stair-stepped cavern above on top of a shrine that surrounded the Sarcophagus.

The collapsed stone had formed a pocket keeping the sarcophagus intact.

The group determines that the ancient elves imprisoned Quil’Sygoth here many thousands of years ago, possibly even before the Crown Wars that saw the birth of the Drow as a cast out sub-race over ten thousand years ago.  

Religious depictions on the ruins show Araushnee; Lolth, before she was cast out.

Excited, Patches realizes that the sword they found is most likely from an ancient elven hero, back from when her people were still part of the greater elven nation.

Patches takes rubbings of all of the murals to record them as best she can and to analyze them further back at the Barony for clues as to where these Elves were from.

Feanon meanwhile, working with the others, manages to decipher some of the ancient text.

It is a history of a sort:  The ancient elves fought against one of their own, an arrogant Spellcaster named Abraxim; a name Feanon recognizes from mythology synonymous with arrogance and a prideful fall.

This Abraxim dared traverse the Outer Gates but was cast back by the Powers That Be.

Abraxim did not return alone and brought with him Halashnar.

It took the Elven pantheon to defeat Abraxim, and the group assumes Quil’Sygoth as well.

Curiously though, Quil’Sygoths regeneration seemed to be a form of Pact magic, the group guesses it to be a Pact with either Abraxim or Halashnar.

If so, the Pact is still active and very strong.  Abraxim and Halashnar are out there somewhere, funneling power to this creature.

The group searches the collapsed ruins but find no more than the single shrine.

They return to the main cavern above and head back to the Duergar Barracks, intent on looting it thoroughly and then returning to the Barony.

They all notice very quickly that the Sarcophagus is gone.

The group begins to question Feanon who begins lying through his teeth and when confronted, tries to put everyone to sleep.

Cirrus and Patches resist, and flip their shit on the wizard.

How DARE he attack them with that spell and unilaterally endanger the Barony by teleporting (an imprisoned) Quil’Sygoth.

Feanon tries to placate them, saying that he intends to open the Sarcophagus under controlled circumstances and disintegrate the thing before it can make trouble.

They argue for some time while everyone else snores away.

The argument ends with everyone being mad, but whats done is done.

Feanon wakes everyone he put to sleep and Tark immediately begins yelling about the Sarcophagus.

The disintegration solution is explained to him and Tark agrees, though is equally mad at Feanon.

The group heads inside the Barracks and make quick work of the stone covering the Duergar Lockbox.

Using the keys they retrieved, they open the things and take the haul the Duergar had amassed: Several minor magical items (wand of Secrets, Potion of healing) and a decent amount of gold, ancient jewelry (including a Chardalyn ring), Duergar Coin, and more Chardalyn (15lbs).

The group heads back to the elevator they took down into the place and find Samid waiting for them with a torch.

They invite the Bedine merchant to come back with them to the Barony and talk business and he agrees, on the condition they take him home in a few days.

The group agrees and they teleport back to the Barony, each person retiring for the rest of the night to their respective abodes.
