Gundren and Tark decided to follow the group on Arkto.

Hot on the heels of the others, they hear the commotion in the Hag den and race to meet up.

Just as battle is met in the Hag den, the two of them burst onto the scene, 

Gundren kills the Annis Hag in a hail of Thundercannon shells and Tark’s furious assault forces the Night hags to flee, turning ethereal.

The group prepares to take out the Ethereal creatures, but Patches notes another hag hiding behind them which promptly looses a lightning bolt.

Cirrus is called out by the hags, they recognize him and welcome him to the hole where his victims ended up.

A Marilith slithers out of the pit and attacks Cirrus in a flurry of blades and then moves to constrict and crush the Warlock.

Hurting from the assault, Cirrus takes refuge in a block of ice, just as a Feral Green Hag leaps from invisibility to attack as well.

Tark rushes to help his friend, going toe to toe with the Marilith and coming out bloodied.

The battle is fierce and the group takes a number of vicious hits, but slay the hags and Marilith quickly.

The cave does not grow silent after the battle; the group hears the whimpering calls of help from the hags prisoners.

The group investigates the area and finds a number of children, which they promptly free as well as an Eastern man in rags and an unconscious woman from the Sword Coast.

One of the children reveals the woman to be her mother, but despite the groups best efforts, they cannot revive the woman.

The man is healed and begins to move about, not speaking the language and having Tark translate, the man is stoic and quiet.

The man recovers his pack, but over the course of the conversation, the group becomes concerned that the man is lying to them and clearly recognizes Cirrus’ name.

Tark investigates the pit in the Hag’s den and finds it filled with teeth.

Touching the pile, Ceregorach speaks to him and attempts to influence the monk several times.

Tark is uninterested, unmoved and unfazed by the attacks and leaves when the entity grows frustrated.

The group decides to burn and collapse the cavern in on itself.

They set their bombs, devices and spells and then return to the surface, the Gorgon’s Maw collapsing behind them.

Above ground, the children are put on Arkto and flown directly back to the nearest village.

The rest of the group use mounts and walk back to the Chionthar river.

They continue to question the man - Ujio.


After a fairly tense interrogation and discovering his armor and sword in his bag, the group gets him to admit that he was in the area to find and destroy the minions of Ceregorach.

He does not believe that Cirrus has abandoned the Archfey until he sees that the Jade tooth is gone from Cirrus’ mouth.

Seemingly convinced, the man still insists that he must leave and the group reluctantly lets him walk away.

Hours later, the group makes it back to the River village where they left the Barge and Gil, the boat captain.

They discover that many of the children rescued are from the area and at least two are being reunited with parents.

The unconscious woman however remains comatose.

Cirrus prays over her and realizes that her soul is missing and likely back in the Hag den under tonnes of rock.

Cirrus finds this unfortunate, but he does not say anything to the others as they prepare to continue on upriver…
