The group continues their assault on the Doomstar Legion, hammering the steps of the Ziggurat and the shield-wall formation of Devils

JmJm and Tark duel Bucephelus

The Doomstar Battlemages step out of cover once more but Patches was ready, immediately putting three quarrels into the chest of one

The other however, dashes forward to attempt to disintegrate Feanon but he easily counterspells

Cirrus feels another pull and nearby the air ripples and shimmers as the Demilich tries to push through the planar boundaries

Bucephelus’ head swings around and he stares at the screaming skull and his eyes light up with revelation

The Devil Thundersteps, receiving a solid hit from Tark in response before the blast throws JmJm and Tark backward

Bucephelus appears next to where the skull had just been and with a roar he asks for power from Morathis Doomstar

The Legionnaires on the Ziggurat get slammed by an Ice storm and several go down as Gundren, Cirrus, Feanon and Patches continue their barrage

Bucephelus shouts a command to the remaining Battlemage 

Patches leaps into the thinning formation of Devils and with a flash of moonlight, hits them with a Steelwind Strike, cutting Bucephelus’ throat.

The great Devil staggers back and down to one knee before erupting with power

His Hobgoblin form twists and grows 

The Pit Fiend takes his true form


The Devil’s hands blaze with infernal power and he reaches *through *the planes casting Demiplane and ripping the Demilich from Cirrus’ pocket plane.

Bucephelus staggers back from the undead monster, forming up with his squad into a shield wall

The tiny skull floats there for a moment scanning the battlefield

It then Screams and fleshy tendrils lash out from the crystal surface of the Ziggurat, grabbing and pulling the skull back toward the structure

everyone nearby doubles over in pain as their life essence is sapped by the screaming Demilich

Bucephelus bursts out laughing then turns to the group, saluting and wishing them good luck.

The Battlemage uses a scroll of Teleport and the Legionnaires are gone, including the corpses.

The screaming skull remains, straining against the flesh tendrils as it desperately tries to get closer to the group to feed on their souls

Gundren immediately starts blasting at the Tendrils, severing them quickly, but more of the fleshy ropes lash out and grab at the Skull

The undead gaze falls over Tark and there’s pulse of necrotic energies and the Monk vanishes

JmJm gallops forward on Steeden, doing a circuit of the Ziggurat, scooping up the unconscious hostages and carrying them to safety.

Feanon calls upon his most potent magic, attempting to shut the Demilich down quickly and Wishes for a Feeblemind to afflict it

The massive psychic assault simply washes over the feral undead monster, having little to no effect

Feanon curses

Tark finds himself in an endless void lit only by the red of his glowing prosthetic arm

He can see a faint shimmering dome around him in the red light

Just as he notes this, the Darkness lashes at him, sinking cold claws into his very essence and sapping his strength

He yells in pain, his voice echoing in the endless plane of shadow…

The group assaults the Demilich but finds it to be incredibly resistant to everything they throw at it and it keeps feeding on their life force - and the life force of Tark

The fleshy tendrils keep getting blasted and severed, but the Ziggurat sends out more and more, slowly but surely pulling the floating skull back toward the mass of the structure

Inside the Void, Tark battles at the devouring darkness and notes the shimmering in the nearby shadow. 

His arm blazes with power and he launches himself at the shimmering dome he can just barely see and smashes through, reappearing in the material world as warmth returns to him

JmJm rears on Steeden and with a shout and cawing from a flock of ravens, calls forth a massive wave of power.

The earth begins to quake and trees fall as great fissures open up beneath the Ziggurat

The group quickly retreats, backing off from the powerful Earthquake as the ground gives way beneath 

the structure buckles and cracks, showing flesh below the stone

The whole thing falls and the Demilich is pulled back and down by a tendril, vanishing into the destruction 

A great deluge of earth and rock heaps upon the fallen structure and continues for several minutes leaving nothing but a dusty crater of smashed stone and trees

The group gathers nearby, breathing heavily with exertion and attend to the rescued hostages

All are easily stabilized and they take a short rest

The storm called by Doc earlier that day to put out the fires in town roils above, thunder rumbling ominously

They hear shifting stone and earth from within the pit of the earthquake and a scream erupts from the pit like the shriek of some titanic banshee and echoes across the Barony for miles

To the south, an answering roar goes up from the Evermoor and the Black Dragon waiting there

The group rush to the edge of the pit and look down to see the smashed form of the Ziggurat like a gargantuan crushed snail; panes and blocks of shattered crystal revealing flesh underneath and thousands of arms, tendrils and many-jointed legs have erupted from the structures flesh

it slowly pulls itself from the wreckage of the earthquake…
