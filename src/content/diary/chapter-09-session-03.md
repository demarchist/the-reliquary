Things I forgot to include:

Fey Contacted the Abolethic Sovereignty.  They arrive in 4 days. 

Patches was the one to ask Aurinax to help Cercei and inquired about the Gem Dragons initially.

Cirrus wrote to Megno and Dagult Neverember asking about the Plane of Standing Stones but got almost no information back, too obscure. 

He also sent mail to Neverwinter, Sundabar and Silverymoon calling worshippers to the Fane.

The Alchemy shop is called ***Buy the Bottle***

At the tavern, the group mulls over what to do.

Training seems pretty high on everyone's lists and they begin to pen some requests for Li to send for Masters from Silverymoon.

Knowing tuition is expensive in the city, Fey suggests sending their loot to the auction houses to sell it off.

Everyone agrees and they prep a little trade caravan to head out in the morning with Li’s assistance.

They also discuss tracking down the Chardalyn Mine lead that Gundren got from Lady Faye.

The Plain of Standing Stones is massive though and would be like looking for a needle in a haystack.

The group decides to try and narrow down the search and go to the Dwarven miners as the group knows Sundabar sends out mining expeditions to the Anauroch Desert.

Alas though, Peb and his lads have never even heard of Chardalyn.

The group sleeps through the night, enjoying their much needed respite from the horrors of the Underdark.

Waking up the next day, the group goes about their daily rituals, awaiting the arrival of Aurinax.

Fey stops by the Dojo to see if Jin the painter is doing ok after the sleep spell.  He finds out quickly that the man is up and about.

Fey continues on to see Doc B. and inquires about a budding plan.  Fey needs Chardalyn and he needs transportation to get to it.

Doc agrees and shows Fey a set of Druidic Prayer Beads he has begun carving.

Fey thinks they’re really swell.

Around 9 am, Fey receives a sending from Aurinax, asking for permission to use his teleportation circle.

Fey agrees and heads down to the platform to greet the arriving dragon.

There’s a flash of light from the singularity and the Dwarvish form of the gold Dragon appears at the center of the circle.

Fey’Anon greets Aurinax heartily but trails off seeing the badly bruised face of the Dwarf.

Fey inquires about the state of the war.

It’s going okay, but not great.

Scornubel is under siege in the Hartlands from the Amnians and Tethyrians 

The Thayans have been stopped at Sembia on the sea of fallen stars, though no one has any illusion they will be stopped for long.

Aurinax gestures to the contusions and black bruises and mentions his recent role - ferrying adventuring parties behind enemy lines at Scornubel.

They got wise eventually and he tangled with a pair of White Dragons, causing his injuries.

He remarks that the enemy forces are far too well supported by Chromatic Dragons, something is drawing them to the enemy.

Fey tells the Dragon that far more is going on than the dragon knows and that they should head to the town center.

Fey is offered a flight over there and the wizard graciously accepts.

The dragon dives off the tower, Fey astride his neck and then sweeps out across the lake, passing over the impressive Fane.

The Dragon remarks as the sun is eclipsed, surprised by the magic.

Patches meanwhile awakes early in Over the Moon and has a few things to take care of.

First off, she visits her old friend Claudine in the adjoining alchemist shop.

She enters the shop to find the two alchemists in the midst of floor-planning the store front.

Patches welcomes them and asks if they need anything, before making a few potion requests herself.

Claudine mentions it will probably be a few days before she’s really up and running, but if the requests are simple, she can whip them up with her basic kit.

Patches asks for two Potions of Poison resistance - a simple enough task for Claudine and the Alchemist sends Marzeline up to Kossenberg for some ingredients.

With that taken care of, Patches heads back into the Tavern and spots the baker - **Ivan Whitefingers** shuffling around the kitchen.

Patches approaches and after a quick chat, decides the man needs his own freestanding bakery.

Patches will make a high-street for new Daggerford.

Needing a few new buildings, Patches heads up to the keep to talk to Li.

Passing through the keep, she stops to marvel a little at Gundren’s workshop before continuing on.

The rogue finds the woman’s rooms and simply walks in, entering the bedroom and almost killing Li with surprise.

Elira, Li’s wife rolls her eyes and goes back to her book, clearly annoyed at the lack of personal space.

Patches goes on to ask Li about setting up a free standing bakery shop, Tailors shop and a store front for Gundren’s workshop.

Li says she will look into it and Patches then thanks her and leaves.

As soon as Patches leaves Li’s rooms, Elira can be heard saying “that is NOT ok!”

Patches heads out of the castle riding Kitty.

As she begins to head down the path, she sees a massive golden dragon swooping in from the Northwest.

She rides for the town center to meet him.


The rest of the group gathers, along with the majority of the town.

The average person has never seen a Gold Dragon and all are in awe of the legendary creature.

Ever friendly, Aurinax greets everyone and offers a chance to talk later that day for anyone who wishes.

He then shifts into his Golden Dwarf form and heads into Over the Moon to talk with the group.

Gathering around the group discuss what to do.

Gundren brings up the Chardalyn Mines in the nearby Anauroch desert.

They need a break from the Underdark and Aurinax mentions that searching for those ancient mines will be tricky.

Aurinax mentions that the Bedine of the desert might know of any ancient mines or ruins in the area.

When a map is brought out, Aurinax points to the Shadow Sea, mentioning there are always Bedine camping on the northern shores.

The group begins planning to go there later that day or the next.

The group then goes on and explains the demon issue in the Underdark to Aurinax and what happened in Gracksuluth.

The Dragon is appalled but trusts in the group to sort it out.

Turning the conversation to the reason the Dragon is in the Barony, he brings up some bad news.

Protanther is no longer King of Justice, the new one is Tamarand who lives much farther east - in Vaasa, right by Zhengyi.

Tark questions the wisdom of taking the pieces so close to the Witch King and the group agrees.

Aurinax offers to go to Protanther anyway for advice and the group starts to agree before Fey stops them.

He remembers an old spell Theodemir once talked to him about and after asking his old master in the ring, says a name: Sequester.

No one has heard of it, even Aurinax.

Fey goes on to talk about pushing an item or person slightly out of sync with time, rendering it invisible, undetectable and in a state of suspended animation.

Combining the Sundabar Vault’s security with this spell on the Artifact should be enough to keep is safe.

It’s as good a plan as any and Aurinax says he will return to Waterdeep and look for anything about such a spell.

After that, the group asks if there’s anything the Gold Dragon can do for Cercei.

Aurinax is put off by the presence of a Black Dragon, but sucks it up and talks with them.

He hears what happened and confirms that there’s a very good reason Dragons are not artificially aged by magic, it’s impossible to do without terrible side effects.

The group implores him to find more information to help and he sighs and performs a sending to Protanther.

Finishing, Aurinax mentions Crystal Dragons also known as Gem Wyrms; that in the legends, many of the original Crystal Dragons were changed or transformed from mortally wounded metallics or chromatics.

It’s not much, but it’s at least a thread to pull on.

Aurinax takes the rest of the day to tour the barony and talk with the citizens, much to their delight.

Stopping by Gundren’s workshop, he hurls insults at Surtr and the Giant grumbles back.

The only thing stopping the two throwing down then and there being that they are both guests of Gundren.

Aurinax breathes on the Platinum-gold alloy prepared by Gundren the night before, some of the material is vaporized in the blast and only a small pool of glowing metal remains.

Gunren and his brothers pour it into an ingot mold, saving the precious bar of **Arumn** for the creation of the Glacium Hammer he and his brothers are forging for Thorna.

Aurinax heads around the rest of the Barony, loving the place.

Getting to the Druid Grove, he goes in to see Cercei, the Black Dragon.

He grows visibly uncomfortable but agrees that having her in the grove, on hallowed ground is as good as its going to get to stop the corruption of Tiamat.

As for Crystal Dragons and fixing Cercei, he will have to do more research.

Aurinax takes his leave and the group bids him farewell for now.

The group turns in for the evening. 

They plan on heading to the Anauroch Desert via Teleportation circle to Ravenloft Castle 

Then Doc will Windwalk them down to the Sea of Shadows.

Cirrus takes the evening to bring the Illusionist painter - Jin, to his sanctum and show him the Selune Art.

He commissions the painter to do a massive mural across a wall and the painter agrees.


The next morning, the group gathers their gifts and trade goods to take to the Bedine of the Anauroch in exchange for information on a Chardalyn Mine in the Plane of Standing Stones.

The group take their supplies to Fey’s tower (including two horses) and head through the Teleportation ring.

They find themselves in a place from what seems like a lifetime ago - Strahd’s Study in Ravenloft Castle.


The place looks much as they left it, but better lit and missing that horrible pall of dread that once lay over the place.

Indeed, the fireplace crackles warmly with a lit fire and a glass of wine rests on a table nearby.

Wasting no time, Doc pulls out his massive pipe and begins puffing up a large cloud.

He swirls it around the group and they are swept up by the Windwalk.

The immaterial group bursts through the doors of the Study, past a set of heavily armed guards about to head into the room.

The windwalk takes them up the tower where they battled Peytr and his Vampires with the great crystal heart above, past where Buumi lost his arm and Patches was possessed by her weapon, and up into the clear blue skies of the Anauroch desert.

Far below, the castle is in much better shape than when they last saw it, with the majority of the castle fully repaired.

Some pieces can still be seen magically floating - one entire tower seems to have been intentionally left this way.

A veritable army of humanoids can be seen working all over the castle, though speeding away it is hard to make out specifics.

Just as the group leaves, a Blue dragon flies down, landing at the Castle gate, hundreds of feet above the desert floor.

The dragon shifts into the form of an elf and walks in, though he looks up at the departing party with confusion.


The party races on, howling through the winds of the unforgiving Anauroch desert. 

The expanse of windswept brown rock and sand stretches beneath them for hundreds of miles.

After several hours of rapid travel, a mesa can be seen rising on the horizon.

At its edge, several great menhirs and obelisks can be seen.

The Plain of Standing Stones.

The group rushes on past and as they do, Fey can feel magic radiating from some of the stones.  Some of them are made of Chardalyn.

Rushing on, near to the end of the Windwalk enchantment and with the Sun beginning to dip on the horizon, the group sees the massive body of water surrounded by mountains on all but the northern side: The Sea of Shadow.

At the northern shore they can see a massive camp of tents and yurts - the Nomadic Bedine.

This camp is enormous, well over ten thousand people.

As they head in, the group sees an elaborate salt mining operation, using the waters of the Sea of Shadows to distill salt.

The group lands just as the Windwalk expires and an eclectic group of adventurers is deposited on the outskirts of the Bedine camp.

Making no effort to hide themselves (save Patches who ducks behind Buumi to enact her ring) the group is quickly confronted by armed guards rushing to the site.

Though surprised at a group of appearing adventurers, and shocked at the manner of arrival, the guards do not draw their weapons.

After a few minutes of Tark introducing himself, a well dressed Bedine man arrives, walking out of the Tent city.

Wrapped in cream colored silks, with an ornate scimitar belted on one hip a red head wrap and scarlet cloak, the man is dressed richly and exudes wealth. 

He has a friendly face with a wide-toothed grin and a bushy black moustache and beard.  The middle-aged human introduces himself as Samid, a Merchant of the Bedine.

He welcomes the group and the group mention they are here to trade for information.

Samid smiles and ushers them toward a large and lavish looking tent.

The group makes their way inside and enjoy some refreshments.

Patches manages to chip a tooth on a Date seed as she had never had them before.

The little serving girl panics and fetches a root for the Drow to chew on for the pain.

The group parades out their goods and the negotiations begin.

After some haggling, the group agrees to trade some of their uncut gems, a horse and one magic item for the information they are looking for: The location of a Chardalyn Mine.

Samid tells them what he knows: The Plane of Standing Stones is riddled with ancient mines - this place was the heart of Netherese mining operations.

Not to be discouraged, he goes on to mention that his people know of many ruins and potential locations, but he thinks he knows which one the group is looking for.

A week ago a band of his traders went to take shelter from a sandstorm by **A’Tar’s Offering**, a great obelisk to the Sun Goddess of the Bedine.

During the storm, his traders were attacked by Dark Dwarves.

Why would the Duergar be in the area if not to mine something valuable.

It could be that Gundren’s tip about a Chardalyn Mine is the same reason these Duergar are here.

The group agrees to go and take a look and Samid shakes on the trade.

Samid begins talking with Doc, heading out of the tent to point out star constellations as the sun sets, to direct the Druid toward the reported location of the Duergar.

The group heads out of the trading tent and prepare to leave with another Windwalk spell as night truly begins to fall.
