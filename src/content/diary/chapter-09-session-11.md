The sun grows low on the horizon and reflects beautifully across Lake Selunia

A chill, but pleasant spring evening begins to descend over the Barony and the party begins to breathe easier with the Sovereignty having released the last four prisoners.

The Amniotic sacks are quickly opened and the prisoners wake and are helped to their feet.

Uira thanks Feanon for the rescue and mentions “hearing” a song while sleeping in the sack.

Turvey confirms that she heard the same haunting song in her mind while she slept and begins to hum it, the others all nod in agreement.

Turvey and the two villagers (who are VERY confused) head the short distance to the docks and the waiting boat and are joined by most of the party as they head back across the lake to the Barony proper.

Feanon and Uira head up to the tower and through the wreckage with Feanon telling the others he will catch up with them at Over the Moon.

In Feanons tower, he double checks the cloning vats, checking in with lady Faye and Lemerlais before heading to the Tavern.

Down at the boats, the group is heading across the lake when someone asks Tark if he has checked on the cave bear cub today.

Tark yelps and leaps from the boat, running across the water in the direction of his tree house.

He makes it to his tree house and notes the creature sleeping in the rafters.

The space is a bit poop-laden so Tark gets a shovel to start cleaning.

When the small beast awakes, he leads it gliding through the trees to the lakeshore and bathes himself and the bear.

The bear goes off to do its own thing and Tark heads to the nearby town center.


At the tavern, the group convenes to discuss what to do and where to go next.

The town is nowhere near as bustling as it was due to the attack but Cirrus and Gundren begin to work with the Dwarven architects to re-invest the money given by the Sovereignty and spruce up the defenses.

They draft plans for fortifications for the Barony.


Snorbul looks on hopeful that they will resume their quest in the Underdark and head to Blingdenstone to save his family and get the second half of the key to Gravenhollow.

The group agrees, but decide to wait for one more day before going, to head to Sundabar to finish crafting Thorna’s magical hammer.

The group retires for the evening to their respective abodes.

Patches inquires with Mr Pickles, asking after the Bedine trader that came back with them.

She finds him gambling away with the Dwarves in the basement and has Mr. Pickles send a reminder to DocB to transport the man back to his people when he wishes.

She also finds out that two agents will be heading her way, associates of Abalaba in Sundabar.


Fea returns to his tower, heading to his rooms.

Lemerlais arrives shortly after and warns Feanon that cloning is known to cause long term issues - Manshoon went insane over time due to subsequent cloning of clones etc.

Additionally, she warns that the longer lifespan of elves may introduce other issues.

Feanon thanks her and then retires for the evening.


Cirrus meanwhile has returned to his barony, checking in with Topsy and Turvey (who both express a desire to live with their own people).

He hears from Beryan about the information on Orcus he has been wanting**:**The Palace of Everlost, in the frozen bone wastes of Oblivion's End

Heading into his inner sanctum, he begins his prayers for the evening but checks the Well of Many Worlds first.

Casting it against a nearby wall, the portal opens to a mind-bending sight.

Through the portal, the largest wall Cirrus can comprehend stands, light shining from every stone.

The massive fortification, ascending thousands of feet and spanning off into infinity is made from white stones, each carved with thousands of runes and symbols emitting light.

Shining, armored figures rush to and fro and the sounds of combat can be heard raging from the other side of the fortification.

As Cirrus watches, trying to figure out what he is witnessing a figure lands in front of the open portal.

A 9ft tall, blue skinned angelic celestial stands before Cirrus, wings folding behind it.

Cirrus introduces himself and asks if he can step through and assist in the battle.

The Planetar looks over Cirrus, noting the symbology of Selune and thanks the Warlock for his concern but mentions that “Mortals engaging at The Outer Gates is not recommended”.

Cirrus asks the being its name and it responds with **Luthiel.**

The Planetar then grasps the Well of Many Worlds and tugs, ending the portal.

Cirrus stands there, thinking about what he just witnessed.


Tark swings by Gundren’s manufactory.

The Monk knocks on the door, waking the Dwarf and simply entering when the door opens.

He then proceeds to ask Gundren to design a locking mechanism for a Bag of Holding.

Gundren adds it to the list of stuff, right next to the plans for Patches Crossbow.

They will pick up the materials the next day, at Sundabar.


The morning rolls around and Patches, Gundren, Tark and Thorna all teleport to Sundabar with Gundrens brothers lugging the Adamantite chest containing the valuable resources.

They head through the Guild Teleportation House and out into the Everfire district before heading north to the Artificers Terrace.

They meet up with Slagbelcher, the smith Patches had previously contracted to work with and who Gundren had gotten to forge the mundane hammer (from Adamantite and Mythril).

Slagbelcher greets them, handing Patches a box of 10 bullets he was working on (and saying he would have had more if he had known she was coming, he just mailed a batch).

In the forge, the group sees what Gundren’s genius has cooked up.

A large tank filled with some kind of liquid, with the hammer head suspended within and two massive electrodes sticking out of the top and a small harness for holding the Glacium chit.

On a nearby bench, the handle, Sapphire and fitting rest.

Gundren takes the Aurum (Enchanted gold) and fits the handle first.

Then Barthen fits the sapphire with assistance from Nundro.

Assembling the hammer with the head still in the electrolyte solution, they then place the Glacium within the harness, frost falling from the enchanted Mythril.

Gundren puts on his rubber gloves and grabs the copper cables and then asks Thorna to whip up a storm.

Unsure if she can even do that, she summons her hammer with a flash of sparks and electricity and holds it aloft.

After ten minutes of channeling power, a small thunderstorm roils with flashes of lightning.

Thorna calls down a blast of lightning to the electrodes as Gundren hooks up the cables to the Electroplating tank.

There’s a blast of light, so bright that all are blinded (save patches who put on her shades).

Gundren is thrown against a nearby wall.

When the smoke and light clears, the Electroplating tank is cracked and leaking, but none of the Glacium remains in its harness.

Instead, frost and ice begins to form around the softly glowing Owl-faced head of the hammer suspended in the solution.

Stormvordur has been successfully created.

Thorna picks up the hammer and grins, testing its balance and heft while Gundren embraces his brothers and shakes Slagbelchers hand.

After a quick conversation, Gundren convinces Slagbelcher to come to his workshop and join him in his crafting endeavors.

Slagbelcher agrees.

Tark and Patches have Slagbelcher pick up Adamantite and Mythril for their own projects and he promises to bring it to the Barony.

Giddy with excitement after the successful crafting, the group steps out into the Artificing terrace and head toward a nearby Alchemy shop, seeing what's in stock before heading to the Underdark.

Inside, they pick up a potion of Reduce and Patches steals a potion of Ogre Strength.

They head out from Sundabar and return to the Barony.


Meanwhile, Feanon has been doing spell research, working with Theodemir and the Iron Tome on a new Distortion spell.

Cirrus and Snorbul have been doing their own thing, heading into the Dreaming chamber in the Fane to contact Gruttag, Snorbul’s uncle.

While they have to wait many hours for Gruttag to sleep, he does so mid-afternoon for a short spell; long enough to make contact.

Snorbul sits down to eat a meal with his uncle in the dreamscape and asks if the family is safe.

Gruttag reports that Blingdenstone is tested daily; Ghosts haunt the ruins, Ooze attacks are becoming more frequent, as are Demon attacks.

The lose people daily.  The Attrition will end them eventually.

Additionally, Gruttag reiterates that some people are beginning to act strangely, being distant and more quiet than usual.  He worries for his family and friends.


The group reconvenes at the Barony, hammering out final details before their morning trek.

They decide to head BACK to Sundabar and secure transport through the Dwarven Runegate to Mithril Hall, a far closer settlement to Blingdenstone and a potential place to get details on the route.

They see Magistrate Li eating dinner with Elira in Over the Moon and inform her of their new plans.

Li acknowledges and lets the party know that Silverymoon has been informed of the Aboleth incursion and in response have hired a Mercenary band to shore up the Barony defenses: **Bohd’s Band**.

She then hands Feanon a crimson envelope sealed with black ink from The Netherese and returns to her dinner.

That night, Feanon reads the letter; an official response from The Netherese that Lady Avelyere of Shade Enclave will be visiting in two weeks to tour the barony and speak with Feanon on arcane matters.


The next morning, the group gathers at Feanons tower and teleport back to Sundabar.

They head to the Veterans district and the Fortress there that houses the Runegate.

They are recognized as The Heralds/FDF and after a short negotiation, are granted access to head through to Mithril Hall.

The group heads through the long fortified hallway to the Runegate, being stopped by the heavily armored Dwarven Juggernauts to check their authorization papers, and then let through.

It takes everyone a moment to even register that they had traveled to another Dwarven Citadel.

The array of heavily armed guards facing them is a give away, but after checking their authorization papers once more, the group leaves the fortifications around the Gate in Mithril hall and head into the Undercity.

Without the sweltering heat of the Everfire at its heart, Mithril hall is a very different citadel, the Undercity filling a massive V shaped cavern with tier upon tier of the city rising above them as they exit from the Runegate fortress at its bottom.

Asking for directions from a nearby guard, the group heads up several floors on an elevator to The Hall of Ancestors, next to the temple of Moradin.

Inside they inquire with the elders of the clan and manage to dig up an old account from a Svirfneblin refugee, a Burrow Warden, over a century prior.

With a first hand account of the trip in hand, the group descends through the undercity and into the lower mines of the Citadel.

Passing checkpoint after check point, eventually the group gets to the last of the Dwarven fortifications and the barrier between civilization and the wilds of the Underdark.

They head out into the darkness.

Using landmarks mentioned in the account, they head past a long dead Ettin skeleton and begin the relatively short trek to Blingdenstone.


Many of the group are uncomfortable to be back in the lightless underdark.

Thorna however, is borderline panicked, being almost totally blind.

Gundren summons his Tenser’s disc however and the Genasi simply sits on it, the magical construct following the Dwarf 20ft behind.

The first day is relatively uneventful; winding tunnels, darkness and dampness.

They find a good chamber to rest and summon Feanon’s manor house.

Over the course of the evening though, movement is detected and Tark heads out to investigate, coming into a large angled cavern filled with boulders from an old collapse.

He spots ten Goblins, each wearing black leather armor and carrying wicked looking blades.

More concerning however, the Goblins have with them a pack of 6 Chimera.

Tark returns to warn the group and Patches decides to try her hand at a little deception.

Donning her Priestess of Lolth outfit, complete with spider jewelry and a Tentacle Rod, she strides into the cavern to confront the Goblins.

Confronted with an irate Drow Priestess, the Goblins immediately reconsider moving forwards.

Though wary of trickery, the Goblins disperse into the tunnels and do not harass the group any further that night.

Continuing on the next day, the group has another rather uneventful day of travel, once again settling down in the evening to rest.

Those of the party on guard outside however are alerted by the sounds of cracking rock and can feel tremors in the ground.

A large blue-shelled monster erupts from the ground to attack, rapidly followed by five others.

Bulettes.

The rest of the group rushes from Feanons manor to engage the creatures, which are surprisingly deadly foes, their powerful claws and jaws capable of tearing stone apart.

Though injured in the process, the group quickly deals with the beasts.

Gundren attempts to butcher the creatures, but the anatomy is foreign and he has little luck.

Off in the darkness, Patches spots a Goblin slink away into the tunnels.

The next day they continue, rested and now wary as they are nearing Blingdenstone.

After many hours of lightless tunnels the sounds of mining picks reaches their ears.

Snorbul takes the lead, intent on reaching his people.

Thorna looks down a side passage, holding her magical hammer aloft so its glow can reveal the tunnel.

She freezes as she spots a Kobold carrying a large, leathery, purple egg.

The creature makes eye contact and then bolts off into the darkness.

An hour or two later, the group enters a smallish cavern acting as a hub for many tunnels.

Standing at the entrance of a far tunnel is a Deep Gnome Foreman.

He greets the group warily, but offers friendship as they are “led” by a Deep Gnome.

Nearby deep gnomes call out “Drow!” as they spot Patches, but Snorbul vouches for her.

They eye her suspiciously.

The Foreman and Snorbul wrestle to prove that Snorbul is truly a Deep Gnome and when the Barbarian easily bests the Foreman, more Deep Gnomes step from concealment.

Snorbul introduces himself properly, mentioning Gruttag and the Deep Gnomes begin to relax a little.

The group is then escorted deeper into the Deep Gnome Mines, seeing many workers and mining operations (clothes neatly folded) extracting ore and gemstones.

The group spots guards, but not nearly as many as they would expect for such an operation.

Snorbul and Patches both suspect a significant elemental presence shoring up their defenses.

They make it to a larger dimly lit cavern and see several dozen Deep Gnomes relaxing here, enjoying meals and taking breaks.  All clothed. 

At a table, Snorbul spots his uncle Gruttag and three cousins and calls out a greeting, rushing to his uncle.

They have a heartfelt reunion and Snorbul asks after the troubles.

Gruttag looks over the group quickly before answering his nephew, mentioning the attrition they suffer daily and hoping that Snorbul and his friends might be able to help.

As they are talking, the leader of the mines enters the chamber and Gruttag gets up to introduce his nephew and the surface worlders.

Snorbul looks past his uncle to his cousins and smiles, but the smile falters as he looks at his cousin Yuri, the normally affable deep gnome is staring at him blankly and a shiver goes up Snorbul’s spine…
