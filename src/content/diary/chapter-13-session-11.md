The next morning, the group packs their camp and continues their trek toward the Machina factory

They discover that Tark slept terribly, as Hohonu assaulted him with foul nightmares

Feanon casts Mind Blank on Tark so that Hohonu can no longer send him Dream spells and Tark looks relieved, if tired.

They find themselves setting off for the day on the edge of an ancient battlefield with detritus and ancient machina corpses visible across the expanse.

Feanon determines that the area is riddled with magical instabilities and does his best to lead the group through the dangerous place

Cirrus steps on an ancient mine and though Patches attempts to disarm it, the bomb goes off, injuring her and Cirrus.

As they move through, several ancient automatons rise to give chase, but the group outpaces them and avoids the wild-magic created by them

Just as they are leaving the area though, a particularly large and ancient Machina begins to rise and Feanon is forced to cast a spell which causes a Wild-magic reaction

The blast throws him from his feet and when the wizard recovers, he finds himself revitalized (lvl 8 spell slot regained).

They rush on, putting distance between themselves and the ancient battlefield and head further into Thueba Swamp.

They put several hours into the hike, avoiding the deep swamp and keeping to the dry(ish) land.

Eventually, though, Patches hears something and calls a halt

Then everyone else begins to hear the strange “rushing” sound and they notice the nearby trees and underbrush swaying and moving

A veritable tidal wave of insects comes pouring out of the jungle, devouring all in its path.

The group rushes next to Cirrus, who enacts a domed wall of force just as the things swarm over it, blotting out the sun and causing a cacophony of clicks and chittering within the dome of Force.

The only person not in the dome is JmJm, who is riding Steeden and flees into the Ethereal Plane.

He watches the horde of insects from the safety of another Plane and scans the area

He notes patches of Shadowfell energies in the distance

The insects finally move on

Cirrus drops the dome of Force, everyone who had taken shelter is fine, if rattled.

They reiterate how much they loathe this world

JmJm rejoins them, commenting on the nearby shadowfell energies.

The group surveys the devastation of the insect swarm: The whole area has been stripped of all vegetation, leaving bare dirt

This has also revealed a large Brass Machina, seemingly made of cylinders 50ft in length and joined together.

The Machina “worm” is embedded into the ground and the group manages to find a long corroded door and force it open.

They discover that it had passenger compartments and find long decayed corpses of Saurians and Elves inside, thrown to the front of the carriage as if by a sudden stop.

They loot the bodies of valuables and decide to try and delve deeper into the strange Machina

They drain the water from the underground carriage cars and push deeper, going underground 

Just as they reach the bottom of the flooded cars, a massive tentacled monster erupts, attempting to consume the party.

They battle the thing, blasting it with bombs and magic, but it responds with flickering lightning.

They suspect it to be some sort of Kraken

Cirrus Banishes it and the group rushes past, draining another section of train cars and pushing even deeper into the Machina Worm, before finally reaching the “head”

They force open another door and spill out into an ancient, derelict tunnel far beneath the Swamp.

Not wanting to hang around for the Kraken to re-appear, the group heads forward into the dark and dank tunnels - Patches and Snorbul leading.

They determine that these ancient Saurian tunnels must be a part of a larger transportation network, and if the factory they are heading to is of Saurian make, they suspect the tunnel to lead straight there.

The group walks for hours, the bored tunnel being mostly intact, though very wet, with several feet of stagnant water at times.

No creatures meet the group in the tunnel

Eventually though, they spot an opening up ahead -  a station for this transportation network.

They approach cautiously and are vexed as several of them begin to hallucinate and see illusions or become frightened.

Indeed, the group attempts to push forwards carefully and know that *something *resides in the ancient Saurian ruins, but nothing attacks them

In fact, they see living Sarians come down into the ruins and address the group, seemingly waiting for the party to show themselves.

Tark with his mind blank, is unaffected, and Cirrus casts the same spell on himself

They do not fall for the things deceptions

Buumi moves forwards, and with his divine sense, finally makes out the creature assailing them

A massive Mimic of some kind, infused with Machina and causing wide-spread hallucinations and illusions.

The group battles the thing, with Feanon hitting it with numerous disintegrations.

Eventually, they spot a pulsing Machina wreathed gemstone at its core, and they smash it, causing a violent torrent of energies to wash out, melting the very stone and finally killing the strange creature.

The group, tired from the battle, take a moment to recuperate before pushing onwards and out of the ruined transport station, hoping to find the Saurian Machina Factory nearby.
