The “prisoners” approach the dark ritual and are acknowledged by the Shaman.

He is surprised to see Camea but appreciates the sacrifices and sends Patches and Tark under guard around the rim of the tar pit to be presented to Camea’s father, the high-shaman

They spot a hovel across the tar pit and a number of halflings engaged in a ceremony

As they move around the lip, under guard, they spot another prisoner - a Dwarf of Al Askar, under guard and also being prepped for sacrifice.

In the Ethereal Plane, the rest of the party sees their comrades being led off and they follow

As they do, Cirrus looks down into the pit and sees the horrific site for what it truly is: A Prison of epic proportions, primed with human sacrifice to explode and release the titanic entity within.

This thing is right on the cusp of exploding, needing only three more sacrifices for the prison to be opened.

Cirrus lets the others he’s with know - they must stop these sacrifices.

As the group is led around the pit, the Dwarf prisoner watches the newcomers and works on loosening his bonds, if these newcomers give him an opening, he will be ready…

As Tark and Patches near the hovel they are being led to, both think on their comrades in their gaseous forms.

Neither of them are spellcasters and they have no idea how much longer the surprise-gaseous form will last.  But they know it wont be long.

Led in front of the hovel a large halfling warrior with a bone helmet confronts Camea

It turns out this is one of her brothers and he doubts her new-found faith in their dark god, but she pushes past to her father, who while also skeptical, welcomes his beloved daughter back

The High Shaman and his cabal of followers are horribly twisted and changed by intense corruption, there is no doubt that they are fully enthralled by the Death Wyrm imprisoned here

Camea presents the prisoners - who do a good job of playing their roles and the High Shaman makes a gesture and sends his guards to the perimeter to guard from the attack Patches and Tark promise will come.

With some of the tribal warriors sent away, and with the spells of Gaseos form ending any moment, JmJm springs the attack.

Galloping from the Ethereal Plane astride Steden the Nightmare, Cirrus, JmJm and Gundren assault the Halfling Shaman and his followers, and all hell breaks loose.

Tark and Patches free themselves from their fake bonds as the glass bottles on their hips shatter outward, releasing their quickly re-constituting companions; Feanon and Buumi.

Taken by surprise from the Ethereal Plane Assault, the Shaman is hammered by wicked blows and powerful spells as his closest guards are laid low and slain by Patches and Tark

Cirrus calls forth a powerful celestial that focuses its efforts on slaying the High Shaman, immediately putting the dark halfling on the defensive.

The tar pits bubble as the Shaman calls upon his dark god to assist him in finishing the sacrifices to free the Death Wyrm and undead conglomerates of bone and tar begin to pull themselves from the bubbling lake and moving up the walls of the crater

Across the way, the imprisoned Dwarf makes his move, breaking free of his bonds, pitching his captor into the boiling Tar and then grabbing his weapon from a nearby pile of old belongings (from other sacrifices)

As the Dwarf pulls his greatsword from the pile, it dislodges a section, revealing the handle of an ancient Saurian Firelance.

The Dwarf grabs it, levels it at the High Shaman, and begins a fusillade

The Shaman takes brutal hit after brutal hit and recognizes that he’s against some truly epic opponents.

He cant win through brute force, but he can still complete his objective

He rushes to his traitorous daughter, and throws her from the lip of the crater.

Camera falls and hits the rocks brutally, crying out in pain, but does not go into the tar.

JmJm and Tark rush toward the pit to save Camea and take her from danger, but find themselves assailed by halfling warriors, lesser shaman and the strange tar-like creatures.

Moments later though, the High Shaman calls upon his god and casts a circle of death into the pit.

Everyone screams in pain as the necrotic energies wash outward, but Camea falls to the ground, dead

The tar creatures ooze upward and strike at Tark, JmJm and Steeden, their attacks paralyzing the monk.

JmJm sees that they are in a tight spot and grabs his friend and the body of Camea and flees into the Ethereal Plane before they are overwhelmed.

As Cirrus, flying in the air, surveys the battlefield, his mind is pierced by a stabbing pain.

He hears a dark voice, the same voice that warned him before not to meddle, the voice of Hohonu as the Death Wyrm casts Feeblemind upon the Warlock from within the prison.

The only thing that saves the Warlock of Selune is his unyielding faith and holds onto the image of a full moon to take him through the dark enchantment. He resists losing his mind…barely.

The rest of the party meanwhile has been battling the Halflings, cutting them down

The High Shaman is struck repeatedly and the summoned Celestial seems completely focused on the Shaman, striking him again and again

The High Shaman finally falls, his skull crushed and the group turns to the rest of the tribal warriors, intent on finishing off the Abyss Walkers.

The High Shaman stirs though and sits up, casting a spell at the group as he regenerates and stands back on his feet.

The tar bubbles and a surging tidal wave of boiling tar is cast out of the pit, covering Buumi, who screams in pain

The battle still rages and the Tar bubbles as more of the corpse-tar conglomerates begin to form and surge outward.

Cirrus begins to hear laughing in his head as the Death Wyrm enjoys the spectacle, projecting his power outward even while imprisoned.

In the Ethereal Plane, Tark frees himself from the paralysis of Hohonu and turns to see the Shaman regenerate

He notes a strong connection of power, visible as a distinct cord of power, between the man and the Altar to Hohonu and realizes that the Altar is their key to stopping this dark ritual…
