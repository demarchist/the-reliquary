The group begins to move away from the mists, only to stop and listen, as a series of shrill horn blasts sound from behind them and to the North.

The group turns to take to the skies just as a horde of Halfling surge out of the nearby jungle.

Leading them, is Ruru, the remaining champion of Hohonu, astride a massive Sacrosu beast

Cirrus lets loose a Sickening Radiance, but a pulse of energy from the Ethereal plane attempts to counterspell it, but fails.

The nearby Halfling shaman dispels it moments later, but not before it burns many Halflings.

The halflings fling a volley of Skull-bombs from their slings, but they fall short, detonating into a mass of pulsating corruption.

Moments later though, the corruption shifts and a draconic face can be seen writing in it

The group does not fight, they flee to the skies

The Halfling Shaman attempt to pursue but are shot from the sky by Patches, breaking against the stones below

The group looks back and sees below the draconic face in the corruption breath forth a great blast of energy

Tark spots it, being carried by Buumi, and warns his friend at the last second

Buumi Interposes his shield and the two of them are blasted away, hurled apart in the air

Tark grabs his friend, who pulls out of his dive with his wings, and takes flight again

That blast from Hohonu was deadly

This demigod is intent on punishing those who challenge him

Below, Ruru chants in agony and the Sacrosu twists and grows, its flesh tearing apart as it consumes nearby wounded Halfling Warriors.

The abomination begins to consume Ruru atop it and grow, becoming a twisted amalgam of creatures in the vague form of a Dragon.

It flaps its fleshy wings and takes flight in pursuit of the group…

The group flees as fast as they can, and they outpace the pursuing Avatar of Hohonu.

Gundren informs them that Arkto is nearing his limits and they’re going to have to set down soon.

The group sees the dark speck of the pursuing Avatar on the horizon

They look for an overhang they can hide a camp in and find some old ruins

Feanon hides his Magnificent Mansion in the Arcane shadow of an ancient glyph, while Tark and Patches hold the bags of holding in the material plane and hide.

Both pull their cloaks tight and remain motionless, wrapped in concealing magics.

After a few hours of waiting, something crashes down into the swamp nearby, a few hundred meters away

It crashes through, smashing everything in its path and uprooting trees.

It searches for the group

It does not find them

After hours of searching, the things search takes it out of sight, or sound of the party

It does not return

The next morning the group sets off with all stealth to finds the Machina Factory and finally leave this world

Over the course of the day, the swamp slows their progress and insect hamper their every step

It is a long day and toward the end of the hot, muggy afternoon, Feanon spots something in the near distance

A Ziggurat surrounded by ruins

They investigate, and discover that it is an ancient temple of Fawden, long desecrated and now guarded by two Gorgons.

Cirrus convinces them that he is an agent of their goddess (not entirely untrue) and Feanon returns the part of the temple that was stolen that he found outside on petrified halflings.

They reset the missing eye of the Idol and the Gorgons vanish

Cirrus witnesses a vision of Fawden, who warns him that Vecna/Zalaam has a trap for them in the Machina Factory

This confirms what they suspected.

She confirms there is a Ringed Veil for them in the Factory

She will do what she can to help.

The vision ends

The group, intent on leaving the vicinity of the pursuing Avatar, pushes on

They find another secluded spot, on the edge of an ancient battlefield, scattered with derelict Machina and use the same Arcane Shadow to hide their Mansion doorway.

They talk about their upcoming plans; how to deal with the Factory, and how to use the Ringed Veil against Vecna in the Font of Power

Feanon thinks that the Factory will be deserted and the Gate they need will be trapped…

Patches and Tark both set up for the evening, both pulling their cloaks tight against the clouds of biting insects…
