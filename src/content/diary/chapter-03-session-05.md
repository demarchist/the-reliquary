The group awoke in ancient-looking cells, divided into pairs. As consciousness returned, each pair began their own escape attempt. Fëanon discovered that Zhink — Lady Faye's retainer — was imprisoned across the hall. One by one they freed themselves, and Fëanon teleported to the far side of a locked door to open it from within.

## The Tavern Team

Meanwhile, inside the Tavern of Doors, the rest of the group woke from naps or emerged from their rooms, wondering why they hadn't seen the others in a while. They tried the front door. It refused to budge. After muscling it open, they discovered the box had been chained shut in a storage room they didn't recognize. Their missing companions' weapons and armor lay nearby. Gathering everything, they set out in search of the others.

The escaped prisoners explored their surroundings — ancient decrepit weapons, sealed sarcophagi with amber crystal inserts. Lothli sensed undead within the sarcophagi, and Fëanon determined the seals were magical. They left the chamber and descended into a long hallway lined with ancient reliefs and colored crystal inserts set into the floor.

## Reunion

The Tavern team scouted the same hallway from the opposite end, where two Duergar sat around a small fire. As Tark crept toward them, Lothli and Buumi approached from the other direction. Fëanon struck first with a sleep spell, dropping one Duergar and dazing the other. Buumi charged with divinely-empowered fists while Lothli's arrow caught the grey dwarf in the shoulder. He went down fast.

The sleeping Duergar was restrained and awakened for questioning, but no one could speak his language. They tried communicating with pictures — unsuccessfully. Buumi refused to let the group kill a helpless, unarmed captive, and the others relented on their promises of death. The Duergar was imprisoned in the Tavern of Doors stables, under the watch of the astral goblins — stashed in the same stall where the large goblin cook had been torn apart and which had never been cleaned.

## The Crystal Locks

Now at full strength and fully equipped, the group returned to the main level. Several doors were sealed with colored crystal inserts, and another was simply locked. Deciding that keys were for the weak, Buumi smashed into the wall beside the purple crystal door, cracking it open. Further down the hall, JmJm and Doctor Breakfast let out a tandem Thunderwave that demolished the opposite wall — also destroying the purple pedestal, though the crystal atop survived. Inside was a caged room with a purple lock.

Buumi attempted to rip the cage door open but his strength finally failed him, and the group settled in for a short rest to plan their next move.
