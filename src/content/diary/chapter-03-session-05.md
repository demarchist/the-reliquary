The group awakes to find themselves imprisoned in some ancient looking cells.  Divided into pairs, as they came to consciousness each person began their own escape attempt.  After a few moments of this, Fey discovers that Zhink, lady Faye's retainer is imprisoned across the hall.  After each person managed to free themselves, they opened a door into the next room after Fey teleported to the other side to unlock it.

In the ToD, the rest of the group wakes up from naps or finally decides to emerge from their rooms/workshops.  Thinking they hadn't seen the others in a while, They try the front door. Which refuses to budge, until they finally manage to muscle their way out, to discover the box was chained shut in a storage room they don't recognize.  Looking around, the group notices the weapons and armor of the missing group members and realize something is afoot.  Gathering the equipment and ToD, they head out in search of their missing companions.

The group that escaped the cells explores their surroundings, finding some ancient decrepit weapons, sealed sarcophagi and amber crystal inserts.  Lothli determines that there are undead in the sarcophagi, and Fey determines the sarcophagi are magically sealed.  Leaving the large room, they begin exploring, eventually coming down some stairs into a long hallway with ancient reliefs on each wall and colored crystal inserts in the floor.

The group from the ToD is scouting and come across the same hallway, but at their end are two Duergar around a small fire, chatting.  As Tark begins to sneak up on the Duergar, Lothli and Buumi approach from the other direction.  Fey preempts with the sleep spell, putting one of the Duergar to sleep and making the other woozy.  Buumi rushes in charging his fist with divine might, smashing into the Duergar with an arrow from Lothli catching him in the shoulder and putting the Duergar down.

The sleeping Duergar they restrain and awaken to question, but determine that no one can speak his language.  They attempt to communicate with pictures unsuccessfully.   Buumi refuses to let the group kill a helpless unarmed captive and the group relents on their promises of death, instead imprisoning the Duergar in the stables under the watch of the flourishing tribe of Astral Goblins.  They stash him in the same stable the large Goblin cook got torn apart in…and never cleaned the stall….

Equipping their items, the group is now at full strength and head back to the main level, finding several doors with colored crystal inserts and another that is simply locked.  Deciding that keys are for the weak, Buumi smashes into the wall next to the purple crystal door, cracking it.  Further down the hall, JmJm and Doc B let out a yell and did a tandem thunderwave, smashing the wall down into the room but also taking out the purple pedestal.  The crystal atop is unharmed and inside is a caged off room with a purple lock. 

Buumi attempted to rip the door open but his strength finally failed him and the group set down for a short break.
