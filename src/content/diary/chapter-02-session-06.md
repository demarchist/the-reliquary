Back in the combatant tent, the group congratulated Tark and Patches on their victories. JmJm and Doctor Breakfast ducked into the Tavern of Doors to prepare for the bard's stage that evening. Lothli appeared smitten with Hendrell despite having just lost to him, and left the tournament to spend time with the Champion of the Moonwood.

## Moot vs. Lord Penterghast

While the group chatted, Gundren and his brothers popped out of the box laden with containers, claiming they were off shopping. Fëanon joined after transcribing his new spells. Tark met Endomycles — a burly dwarven gladiator who congratulated Tark and drank to their eventual match.

Tark activated his enchanted eyepatch to scan for magic and noted many powerful heroes and wizards in the crowd — along with Moot's staff and Lord Penterghast's formidable weapons and armor. The fight began. Penterghast couldn't touch Moot, missing by a hair's breadth each time, while Moot couldn't get through the lord's shield. After several spectacular exchanges, Moot launched a two-handed strike that sent Penterghast flying from the ring. Moot bowed. Penterghast nodded in dazed respect.

As the group watched, the jade frog golem snatched an earring from a passing man's ear. The man looked around in confused pain but couldn't figure out what happened.

## Jasmond of Canderberry

The group decided to handle the thieves' guild favor and headed to the Moonstone Mask Inn to find Jasmond. He'd fled to his estate in a fit of paranoia. On the way, Gundren's shopping caravan arrived at the inn laden with goods: tools, trade goods, still supplies, spell components, and a thousand gold worth of artificer materials. He also had some ingredients for Patches' curse-lifting ritual and cloak materials for JmJm. Patches asked him to craft her a pair of tinted goggles for sun protection.

Heading into the wealthy district, the group tracked down Jasmond's estate with help from Lady Carmilla — a noblewoman acquainted with Fëanon's family. Tark jumped the fence, unlocked the gate, and the group walked in. Buumi knocked on the magically locked front door. After presenting documents — Patches had changed into her Baldur's Gate Knight uniform — they were admitted.

Upstairs, they convinced Jasmond that his life was in genuine danger and he should flee to Waterdeep immediately. This was not entirely untrue. Jasmond paid the group and left the city. They reported the success to Benny at the thieves' guild pavilion, who was pleased. The favor was nearly settled, and Raylen might have a special thank-you for them later.

## The Hydra

With daylight remaining, the group headed to the docks to investigate the missing sailors. Buumi and Tark stopped at a pickled fish shop — Buumi, a Neverwinter native, devoured several servings while Tark managed a pickled herring wrap. The elves were sick at the very smell. The fishmonger told them sailors had been disappearing at the north end of the bay and asked for some monster meat to pickle if it turned out to be a creature.

At the far north wall, the group found a dockside tavern full of unsavory types. After an hour of watching and drinking, Tark chatted up the bartender and learned no one had claimed responsibility for the killings — people were beginning to think it was a monster. The bartender pointed them to Dave the Drunk, who lived in the adjacent alley.

The group bribed Dave with a bottle of Baldur's Gate rum to guide them along the waterfront — totally not bait. Dave stumbled into the water up to his waist, dropped his bottle, and stooped to retrieve it before being dragged under with a yelp. Buumi and Tark panicked and dove in, finding a tunnel leading to an underwater cavern. The rest followed.

Inside the cavern, Tark heard Dave's screams and charged around a boulder just in time to see a three-headed Hydra tear the drunk limb from limb. The group engaged — destroying the three heads quickly and efficiently with no damage taken. But four new heads sprouted and the beast struck back, dealing wicked blows to Tark and Buumi. Fëanon conjured a lightning bolt while Patches poisoned the creature. Tark used his ring to call forth a wave of fire, finally stifling the Hydra's regeneration. The group finished the beast.

They found nothing of value among the remains of the missing sailors save for a Firebrand Scimitar +1. After paying respects to what was left of Dave, they harvested as much Hydra flesh as they could carry. The fishmonger agreed to pickle the meat in exchange for keeping half. At the Moonstone Mask, Captain Bastillon paid them for the information and took his leave — grateful his crew had been avenged.
