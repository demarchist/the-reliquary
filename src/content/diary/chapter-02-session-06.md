The group finds themselves post tournament match back in the combatants tent congratulating Tark and Patches.  The group looks over as JmJm and Doc B. enter the tent and quickly retreat into the Tavern of Doors to prepare for the Bards stage that evening.  Lothli appears smitten with Hendrell, despite just losing to him, and leaves the tournament to spend some time with him.

As the group chats, a Dwarven fighter and a shady man go out to fight, Buumi goes to the edge of the tent to check it out whilst Tark looks around at the rest of the fighters, seeing Moot and Lord Penterghast.  After a few minutes, Gundren, his brothers and a few Goblins pop out of the box laden with containers, claiming they are off shopping.  A few minutes after that, Fey'Anon joins the group after having transcribed all his new spells into his spellbook. 

A round of intense cheering marks the end of the next round of combat and the burly dwarf fighter re-enters the tent, a few welts on his body.  Tark congratulates him on his win, Endomycles the gladiator of memnon thanks him and drinks to it, exclaiming that he is looking forward to fighting such a small but well bearded fellow.

The group decides to head out for the day as they aren't needed for the next bout until tomorrow.  Tark wishes to watch Moot and Lord Penterghast fight however.  Leaving the tent, Tark enacts the magic of his eyepatch to look for magic and notes many, many heroes and wizards around.  He also notes the magic staff of Moot again and the very powerful weapons and armor of Lord Penterghast.

The fight between Moot and the Lord begins.  Penterghast cannot touch Moot, always missing by a hairs bredth.  Moot responds and cannot seem to get through the well placed defenses of Penterghasts shield.  After a few back and forths that wow the audience, Moot launches a two handed strike against the shield, launching Penterghast from the ring and winning the bout.  Moot bows and Penterghast nods in respect (still dazed from the fall).

As the group watches the fight, a man walking by Fey'Anon with a wonderful earring has it snatched from his ear by the Frog Golem.  The man looks around in pain and fright, but cannot seem to figure out what happened.

The group takes stock of what they have to do at the Festival, and decides to take care of the business with Jasmond of Canderberry and the Thieves guild and head to the Moonstone mask Inn, the last place they saw Jasmond.

Arriving at the Moonstone mask, they ask around and discover that in a fit of paranoia, Jasmond ran back to his estate.  Following, the group is surprised by Gundren and his caravan arriving at the Moonstone mask, laden with goods.

200gp of Tools

200gp of Trade goods

Still supplies (to create a still)

500gp of spell components

1000gp of artifice supplies

He has some materials for Patches curse lifting and cloak making for JmJm

As Gundren heads into the box, Patches asks for him to make her a pair of tinted goggles to protect her eyes from the glare of the sun. Gundren says he will get right on it.

Heading into the fancy section of town, the group discovers that they have no idea where Jasmonds house would be and need to find it.  Looking around, Fey'Anon looks for contacts his family may have made in the city.  Eventually, a palanquin stops near them and a middle aged Lady pokes her head out of the curtain, all primmed and done up.  Lady Carmilla knows Fey'Anon and they chat for a little bit, discussing the trade deal she has with Fey'Anons father.  Eventually the group gets the information they need and head off to Jasmonds Estate.  A few streets over, they come across a small gated compound.  Jumping the fence, Tark then unlocks the gate and the group waltzes into the entry courtyard.  The next door however is magically locked, so Buumi knocks on it forcefully with his enchanted strength.  After a few minutes, a burly guard, clearly well outfitted and well trained opens the door suspiciously.

By this point, Patches has changed into her Baldurs Gate Knight uniform.  After presenting her documents, the group makes the case that they have important information regarding the safety of Jasmond.  The guard lets the group in and they head to the second floor to meet with him.  Meeting with Jasmond, they convince him that he was right about everything, but his life is endanger and must flee to Waterdeep to be safe (not really untrue…) the group promises to take care of his evidence and at the opportune moment reveal it to the authorities.  Jasmond agrees and pays the group before fleeing the city.  A few hundred more gold in their pocket, they visit the Thieves guild pavilion in the Festival and relay the good news, Benny is quite happy, mentioning that the favor goes a long way to settle the favor for fixing the archery tournament, he also goes on to say that Raylen might have a special thank-you for them later on.

The group then decided to take care of one more quest for the day and headed down to the docks to look into the missing sailors.  Now about 4pm, the group is getting a tad hungry and are dragged to a pickled fish store by Buumi and Tark.  Tark buys a pickled herring wrap and manages to eat it, keeping the foul thing in his belly long enough to chat with the fishmonger.  Buumi, from Neverwinter, chows down on a number of pickled fish and the two elves are veritably sick at the very smell of the pungent food.  Getting on the fish mongers good side, they find out that the sailors have been going missing at the north end of the bay, he asks the group that if it's a big fish doing it, that they bring back some of it's meat to be pickled, the group agrees.

Heading north along the bay, the group notes the hustle and bustle of the city docks.  Eventually, they reach the far north wall and a large Tavern built into the base of it.  The group notes many unsavory types about, but none seem to be taking much interest in them, so the group heads into the tavern.  Once inside, they people watch for an hour, ordering drinks and being non-descript.  Eventually, Tark heads over to the bartender and begins to ask about the missing sailors.  Getting on the man's good side, the group discovers that no nefarious parties have taken responsibility for the killings and that people are beginning to think it's the work of a monster.  The group asks for a guide to the docks and is steered towards Dave The Drunk, who resides in the alley next to the tavern.

Finding Dave, the group bribes him into assisting them (as a guide, totally not bait…) for a bottle of BG Rum.  As Dave stumbles along, Patches and Fey ask him to inspect the waters edge.  Stumbling down to the shore, Dave waddles into the water up to his waist before catching himself and remarking how cold it is.  Dropping his rum bottle, he stoops to pick it up before letting out a yelp as he's dragged under the water by something.  Buumi and Tark panic! Diving into the water after him and finding a large hole and tunnel, leading to an underground/water cavern.  Patches and Fey follow a minute later, a little more cautiously.  Popping out into the cavern, Tark hears the screams of Dave and charges around a large rock in time to see Dave get torn limb from limb by a three headed Hydra.  The group proceeds to battle the Hydra, destroying it's three heads quickly and efficiently, taking no damage in the process.  Just as they think the beast is dead however, four new heads sprout and the best attacks, dealing wicked blows to Tark and Buumi and attempting to hit a hasted Patches.  Fey conjures a powerful lightning bolt and Patches backs off, poisoning the beast and coming in for a surprise blow.  Tark creates a small flame with his fire kit and using the ring, communicates with it.  Hearing the call of the living flame, he uses the ring to strike forth a wave of fire over the Hydra.  Finally stifling it's regenerative powers, the group makes short work of the Hydra, killing it properly.

Searching the underground cavern, they find many remains, including that of the missing sailors.  The group finds nothing of value save for a Firebrand scimitar +1.  Harvesting as much Hydra flesh as they can, they stop by the puddle of blood that is Dave and pay their respects and then head to the fishmonger.  The fishmonger offers to pickle the Hydra if he gets to keep half and the group agrees.  The group then headed back to the Moonstone Mask Inn to tell Captain Bastillon of the fate of his missing crew.  Thankful for the information and glad they were avenged, he pays the group what they are owed and leaves the Tavern.  The group remains in the Moonstone Mask, contemplating what to do next…
