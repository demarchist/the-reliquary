The party looks around and spots a promising looking Inn named “Her Gift”

They marvel at the exquisite otherworldly grandeur of the extra-planar city and love the pristine nature of everything

Tark notes someone brush against him in the crowd, and as he looks around, sees three Drow guards in gleaming Scale Armor barreling toward him

Their weapons are not drawn, but the clearly intent to tackle the small halfling

Tark smiles and waves at them

The lead guard growls “I have you now, Igni!” and leaps

The group notes that where Tark was standing, is a Svirfneblin they do not know

They recognize the illusion for what it is, but the guards do not...

The Patches notes a duplicate of Tark shifting off into the crowd and leaps off in pursuit with Gundren in rapid pursuit of her

Tark’s displacement cloak shifts his position to the leaping guard by a few inches and the Guard misses the tackle…as do the next two that attempt it moments later

The guards get up a moment later, confused as Tark no longer looks like their target and they turn to survey the crowd of onlookers

Patches comes out into a clearing of the crowd and scans around for her target.

Gundren shows up a moment later to assist

They spot the ingenious Gnome climbing the nearby building facade - his skin camouflaged to match the stone

Patches throws a dagger at his fingers pommel first and with a cry of pain, the Gnome falls to the ground, but lands on his feet in an acrobatic crouch

Gundren sprays the little man with Grease and the Gnome flails and slides on the slippery surface

The three guards burst through the crowd and spot their target

Two rush to tackle, but the third hurls a magical boala and tangles the Gnome’s feet

They move in to restrain him but the Gnome leaps to his belly and slides like a penguin on the grease, leaving the guards flailing and sliding

He comes to a rest near the feet of Feanon and asks for a hand

They cut him free and they quickly exchange "cards" before the Gnome darts off into the crowd and the Guard rushes off in pursuit of the slippery Gnome.

Feanon looks at the card - a piece of slate engraved with the name “Igni”

Tark asks an onlooker what that was about and they say something about “The Game”

Indeed, the whole nature of the confrontation was un-serious, no one seemed to be getting violent or deadly with their intentions

Many of the onlooking Drow clap at the spectacle, with restaurant goers raising glasses and nodding salutes to the guards, gnome and group.

Thoroughly entertained, but a bit confused, the group enters *Her Gift*, save Cirrus, who takes his leave and ascends to the higher tiers of the city.

The Inn, a regal establishment more akin to a hotel, is almost full

The common area is awash with commotion with a large group of Raven-like Kenku making most of the noise - a cacophony of mimicked words, each plucked independently from when it was heard and stitched together to form every sentence.

Even the laughing is a mix of different people’s “ha’s” leading to a crazy sounding *murder of Kenku*

Drow give the Kenku a wide berth, but other patrons seem undisturbed, with a robed Hobgoblin writing in a book in the far corner.

An 8ft tank of brass bands and a large glass cylinder stands near the bar, attended to by a cloaked figure polishing the glass.

The liquid within is opaque, though something moves within

They ask for a suite of rooms and how much it will cost

They are told that due to the nature of the current festivities, the Establishment needs payment in something more *interesting* that coin.

Curious about this “game” being played, the group questions the Inn’s Drow attendant

A Dragon is coming to the plane and is to be provided a Lair and a Hoard within said lair

It is a Silver Dragon and she is coming to ascend

The competition happening is for all citizens to donate to the hoard and provide the best treasures

This appears to be a friendly competition between all the citizens, but does not seem to take Igni’s actions into account.

The attendant mention that the Gnome is likely a spy for “the other” a second dragon coming to lair in nearby Nidavellir and seen to by the Dwarves and Gnomes of that Plane.

There is a second level to the competition there - for the Silver coming to Dokkar, to have the better hoard than the Blue coming to Nidavellir.

The group pay for their stay in the Inn with a coalesced memory Orb of Patches finding the Jun Sahara of Alaskar - a lost tribe offshoot of the ancient Drow Illythiri

This memory pays for an exquisite suite of rooms and plentiful food and drink

The group head to their marble rooms and rest for the night, discussing their plans for the next day over wine and food brought to the room.

Patches orders a special bottle, feeling nostalgic about her people, an old vintage of her people which she invites Buumi to share with her

They rest for the next eight hours, sleeping and lounging in their suites overlooking the lower tiers of the city and gazing out into the great starlit caverns of Svartalfheim.

When the group decides to stir, they are revitalized and head out to the higher tiers of the city, to seek out Finn Faen Tlabbar; Patches brother

They stop and ask a city guard for Finn’s location just as Feanon scries on the young wizard.

As Feanon scries someone, he gets the sense that a divine agent read his intent as he cast the spell

This divine agent determined his intent to be non-hostile and allowed the spell to proceed...

Finn is in the gardens by The Endless Stair

The group heads within the stone core of the tiered city - the great stalagmite of stone each ring of the city is built around

On the inside of the stone is a vast cavern of gardens, with stalactites hanging from the ceiling - stained glass windows shining within the white marble gothic architecture

The gardens themselves are lush but well organized and tamed with laws and groves surrounded by couches, pillows and lounge chairs for the many park-goers.

The whispers of poets composing and paintbrushes on canvas fills the air and it seems that everyone is doing some kind of creation - creating art for the hoard of the Silver Dragon

Groups of dancers move through the park, providing sculptors and painters with numerous muses

As the group walks through the gardens, they spot an Illithid moving through the area, seemingly talking with Drow.

The citizens seem unconcerned by it

Feanon however, is quite concerned by it and has a hard time ignoring it

Indeed, he can feel its psionics on the edge of his senses

In the center of the gardens is a huge hole, easily several hundred feet in diameter with an ancient set of marble stairs carved into the stone, spiraling down into the depths.

The waterways of the garden disgorge a steady mist into the Endless Stair

A crowd can be seen gathered around the start of the stair where a Drow woman stands in flowing silver robes staring at the descending stairs before her

The crowd just watches, many painting or composing prose of the “event”

The party then spots Finn on the edge of the crowd with a few other Drow and they call politely to him

Finn turns and spots the group and immediately stands up, delighted and rushes over

The drow he was with seem to slowly register the change and watch Finn leave with a dreamy lethargy

They exchange pleasantries and find that although Dokkar is a wonderful place, it’s a bit odd for the living

Time passes strangely here and there are almost no children.  The older elves have a slow regard of all things, some barely even registering the world around them anymore

The woman at the top of the Endless Stair is one such dreamer - she is taking her "last" journey to Yggward, to slumber among the other ancient souls

Finn recounts what he has heard - that at the bottom of the stair is Nidavellir, where this plane borders on one of chaos and darkness

Many planes meet there - Pandemonium, the Shadowfell, the Astral Sea, Ysgard and others if you look hard enough

Yggward sits where the shadow lies deepest and the depths of the necropolis transition to the land of shadow

On the border of Nidavellir and Svartalfheim sits the great Twilight Cathedral at the gates of Yggward, where petitioners can go and speak to the souls of the slumbering Drow of the necropolis

The group turns their attention back to the lone Dark Elf woman at the top of the stair who seems to be waiting

Finn remarks that the crowd here has come to mark her passing. She is over ten thousand years old now and is going for her second sleep.  

Some come back many times, sleeping for short spans.  Some never return.

Finn shivers and looks away from the ancient soul, he would very much like to return to Faerun 

Patches decides to think it over.  Her mother is still an extreme threat.

She needs to think about the security she would have to beef up for his return and dealing her mother’s shenanigans

For the time being, the party goes about their shopping in Dokkar with Finn in tow

They head to the Night Market and split up

As they leave the Gardens, the Illithid watches Feanon go and the Elf takes note

Buumi and Patches head off on a date, enjoying the street food and looking at some Obsidian crystals to purchase

They find a Dwarven shop and Buumi purchases a massive raw lump of Obsidian to have delivered to the Barony

As a part of the purchase, Patches picks up a Platinum and Onyx card case for her Deck of Illusions.  She wants to gift it to Finn for his protection.

Tark heads to a book store and finds a book called "Tres Liches" so he can research Zhengyi and try and find a weakness.  He doesnt really know how to read very well.

Feanon and Finn head to a bookstore, picking up a Scroll of Slow for Finn and a book on glowing architecture for Feanon

Gundren goes looking for *je ne sais quoi *but knows he likely needs to find a Dwarf for it

He wants something to really bring the **Bloodrinker **Crossbow together, something to bring out it’s excellence

He looks over many exotic materials (including Angel feathers) until he finds a bar of **Aurumn** -* *Enchanted gold vaporized by a Gold Dragon and the vapor then collected and shaped with a Wish spell.

He purchases it, trading the power core of the Amnian Spelljammer and a large Sourcestone Fabrial 

Gundren then heads to the Hall of Hunters for information on shaping Wyvern bone.

The lodge is easy to find and Gundren fits in pretty well despite it being Elvish - they have a rougher quality here as the place is filled with ranger-types and those who frequently plumb the depths of Svartalfheim

Gundren speaks with a grizzled ranger named Korin at a seemingly open bar in the lodge

The old Dwarf notes a particularly exquisite looking bone Bow encrusted with emeralds above the bar

The ancient bow is Lok’Delar from the last Crown War

Korin doesnt remember who made it, only that she left long ago to slumber in Yggward.

She made it with Sandpiper Wyvern

Gundren thanks the man for his time

Korin then mentions that if the group is heading to Yggward, they will be handsomely rewarded if they assist a caravan of treasure going to the Dragon Lair.

Gundren asks how long the journey would take and Korin laughs - such things are not measure in time here

Gundren thanks him for the info and takes his leave.


As Tark leaves to return to the group, he scans the market looking for any leads for his old Windrunner armor schematic.

He saw the Illithid Remembrancer earlier that he could likely trace back to an Illithid Colony for some Elder Brain Ichor

He could always try asking nicely too?

As that thought crosses his mind, Tark sees a green faced figure in azure robes dart out of sight into a small alleyway between ornate Drow architecture

Curious, Tark follows just in time to see a Gith slip out of sight again at the end of the alley

Thinking he may have a lead on the Githyanki Psion Heart, Tark pursues and rushes around the corner, only to be assaulted by the unarmed man

The Gith hits Tarks pressure points, attempting to stun him but Tark expertly defends himself - he tells his attacker he is looking for a Githyanki Psion

The Gith responds that *he *is not Githyanki, but Githzerai 

Tark asks what he’s doing here and the Githzerai says he watches the Gaichk and then throws a flash bomb to the ground, blinding Tark

As he blinks away the blindness, the Githzerai monk is gone…

Tark returns to the Inn with his book, but no rare materials for his armor - but two potential leads

The group reconvenes at the Inn, sharing an exquisite bottle of wine and delectable meal as they are surrounded by curious Drow, noisy Kenku and other Extraplanar visitors

Gundren talks about the Bone bow he found and how he wishes he could talk with the creator

Feanon casts Legend Lore and discovers that the name of the Bow Crafter is Opheli Lu and she does indeed slumber far below in Yggward.

Patches mentions that she has desire to travel to Yggward as well and petition the sleeping souls there for long lost information

If the group is willing to travel The Endless Stair\toward the chaotic plane of Nidavellir and to where Shadow, Thought and Chaos meet, they can ask Opheli how she made Lok'Delar
