Patches contacts Lady Faye saying that she has magical goods to trade and is looking for offers on a Ring of Water Elemental Command

Feanon returns to his tower while JmJm, Patches and Cirrus head to the Fane to question the headless man

Gundren meanwhile has been investigating the Modrons that have been turning up around the Barony

Since the Dragon attack the things have been engaging in routine maintenance without being bidden

Gundren also discovers that they can follow simple tasks seemingly reading his mind

He gets them to work around the Foundry but notes that they have begun to assemble some kind of mechanical contraption in the middle of the Castle Courtyard, next to the foundry.

The Lads are taking bets over what it could be


At the fane, a ritual of reincarnation begins - the man has no head so they will simply grow him a new body and question him!

JmJm strips naked in the ritual circle and begins to anoint himself and the body with the ritual oils

As the reincarnation is cast, the body of the man disintegrates and mingles with the oil, but does not form a new body

The soul does not wish to return

Calling upon divine intervention, Cirrus and JmJm manage to force the spirit to answer five questions - a gift from Selune

Samonosuke is the name of the man's master, a Warlock of Ceregorach

The dead man’s name is Letji and he was sent here to spy on Cirrus with presumably murderous intent

…

…

Cirrus does not ask a final question and instead offers the soul to the Planetar Crisserei to bring to Selune; to save this dark soul

The Planetar “shakes her head” (she is not physically there) and says that Cirrus does not understand

Selune did not *force *this soul here to answer, it chose to when petitioned by the goddess

This is the soul of a good person, not an evildoer

Cirrus is aghast and demands JmJm end the spell

He is shaken to the core, did he make a mistake?

Who was this man, truly?


The group questions their security with this mystery man and the assassination attempt on Patches

Patches brings up that her only lead on who put out the contract is from a fixer in Luskan by the name of Morik the Rogue

JmJm points out that Doc could wind-walk them all there to investigate

Patches, Cirrus and Gundren take JmJm up on his offer and Doc B wind walks the group hundreds of miles to the west, to the last city on the northern sword coast.

The City of Sails; Luskan

They materialize on a nearby hillock looking over the ramshackle “city” at around 9pm


It has clearly seen far better days and the exterior wall is in dire disrepair, with many sections having completely collapsed and others shored up by wooden scaffolding

Many stone structures within the walls have simply crumbled, with wooden shanties propping up among the wreckage, creating a sprawling slum

The Docks dominate the city, with hundred of wharfs and piers jutting out into a crowded bay

Countless ships of all sorts crowd the harbor lit by thousands of torches and lanterns

The sound of revelry drifts up from the city and firelight clearly illuminates the main gate being manned by over a dozen partying ruffians

Patches has been here before, many years ago and recounts what she knows of the place:

It is run by Pirate Lords, their “Ships” run the streets here

The ruling Ship is Ship Kurth 

Jarlaxle is somehow in control of Ship Kurth

Bregan D’Aerthe’s headquarters is **One Eyed Jacks** along the main wharf at the top of Carnival Hill overlooking the harbor

Drow are not uncommon here

It is a lawless gang filled city

The Zhentarim run a field office here and MANY different splinter groups and gangs are Zhent affiliated


The group heads down to the gate and pay their way into the city

Their charisma is sufficient to get an escort through the streets to One Eyed Jacks

As they go, they discover that the raucous party is because the Ships are all back from their mercenary work in the war, as there is currently a lull in the fighting

They work their way through the partially ruined streets and shanties, spying the once wondrous and now ruined Host Tower of the Arcane - the Mage guild-hall of the city now a century defunct

As they near the harbor, two young ruffians decide to try their luck when JmJm openly flaunts his wealth.

They slip a ring from his finger but Patches instantly takes note and pickpockets them right back before slipping the ring back to JmJm

The youth then goes to paw his spoils only to find it gone and he stops, looking around confused and JmJm pounces on the lad

Furious, he forces the boy at sword-point to chauffeur for him

They continue on, approaching One Eyed Jacks and notice that the number of Drow milling about is rising considerably and the group is getting a lot of interested looks (a very wealthy, powerful looking crew riding a Nightmare elicits quite a response)

One Eyed Jacks is the nicest and largest intact looking building they have seen so far in the city

Steeden is dismissed and the group enters the multistory establishment and finds the place filled with ruffians of all sorts


Drinking, carousing, gambling and violence are being dished out in measure and the group looks around for a table, finding the place absolutely packed

Patches spots two Drow she recognizes from her time in Bregan D’Aerthe

One at the bar and one at a table, gambling

She goes to the one at the table as she cant place the specifics of when she met him

The Drow notes her approach and his body language immediately comes on guard

Rude words and thinly veiled barbs are exchanged and Patches demands satisfaction and throws a wooden dagger down on the table

The Drow sneers and the whole table gets up, moving to the back alley as the Drow begins to whistle a repetitive tune

The group follows, curious of this low-life spectacle and the small crowd files out into the dark back alley

The Drow keeps whistling and squares off with Patches

With a flash of insight, Patches realizes where she recognizes this Drow Male.

Not from Bregan D’Aerthe, but from her own Noble House.  This is one of her mothers’ elite warriors

The ruffians with the Drow all pull out weapons and other Dark Elves leap from the shadows, assaulting the group with Poisoned darts

The group is peppered, Cirrus and JmJm falling suffering exhaustion before finding a second wind

Arkto and Steeden are both summoned

JmJm pulls on a mysterious glove from his past…

The battle is short and furious and the group leaves only one survivor, a Drow soldier

The cacophony has not gone unnoticed and movement can be heard from streets all around 

The group looks at the bloodstained bodies and wonder just what they have gotten themselves into…
