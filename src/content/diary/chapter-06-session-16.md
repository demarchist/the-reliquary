**Tapas in Sundabar**

Buumi and Patches find themselves outside of the Northern Clan Vaults.

With the evening wearing on, they decide to head back to The Everfire Cavern and grab some dinner from a Waterdhavian place Buumi had mentioned.

They make it to the restaurant without issue, Buumi attempting small talk but Patches is too lost in thought to pay attention.

They sit down for dinner and once again, Patches is not really paying attention, thinking about the Vault security.

They finish up eating and then head out.

They make it back to Megnos place.

Patches then asks Megno to enchant the Platinum mask she got in Barovia off of one of the vampire brides, asking for a minor enchantment.

Megno agrees and hands it off to his human apprentice; Molly, a gangly teenage girl.

Concerned about the quality, Patches begins to complain but Megno assures her of Molly's skill and Patches relents.

After handing off the mask, Patches excuses herself and Buumi stays at Megnos while Patches goes to meet her Zhentarim contacts.

Making it to the Uppercity without issue, Patches finds that the city has undergone a lot of change since she was last up here, with much of the rubble cleared and many structures being renovated and rebuilt.
  

**A Trip to Abalaba**

Traipsing through the cold, snow covered streets of the Uppercity, Patches makes it to "Shady-town" and finds that many of the ramshackle shanties and temporary structures have been replaced with proper buildings.

The Sloppy Sahuagin is one of them and she finds a large two-story inn with new timber and whitewashed walls, a wooden rendition of a drunken Sea-Devil hanging out front as a sign for the Inn.

Heading inside, past the huge, fat bouncer, Patches sees a vibrant and lively establishment filled with patrons.

Disguised as Stitches, Patches heads through the crowd heading for the office.

One stupid patron tries to pickpocket Patches as she goes past, and she grabs his hand and breaks his fingers before moving past.

Abalaba watches from her office and when Patches approaches, the young Gnome woman laughs and beckons her inside and asks her to shut the door.

Patches stands behind the plush chairs and begins chatting with Abalaba, getting a new supply of poisons and bomb-making parts.

Abalaba mentions she loves getting this stuff from lady F as she pays so well.

Patches mentions the southern Vault and Abalaba gets coy, NOT saying things and throwing in hints without giving away too much.

Patches ends up determining that she's not the only one with interest in the Southern Vault and another Zhentarim crew is possibly in town to try and tackle it.

Abalaba still thinks its suicide.

Patches thanks Abalaba, pays her and then leaves, heading to the Southern Clan Vault to case the place and see what she can see.

**The Descent of the Bluff and Shadowclaw**

Over at the Barony of Thunder Bluff, Tark, Fey, Cirrus, Mr.Pickles, the Cats and Moogie (the ranger) are all heading out from the ruins of High-Hold to take care of Shadowclaw; the Troll that drove the Orcs out of the caverns.

Heading out of the ruined gates a commotion behind them catches their attention and the group turns to see four young Orc warriors coming to meet them, each with a great-axe.

The Orcs don't speak common but after some translating from Mr. Pickles and Moogie, they find out that the Orcs are showing them a stone stairway down to the river caves.

Moogie remembers after they mention it and she kicks herself and her old brain for forgetting.

Heading to the southern edge of the bluff, the group comes to the ruins of a watchtower and find the 2ft staircase cut into the rock.

The stair is treacherous in the snow and even more so with the width, the cats start to try and descend but quickly give up as Mr.Pickles is almost pitched from Kittys back and the cats back off.

At the same moment, Cirrus slips and is caught by the collar.  Further down one of the Orcs has slipped as well and only Moogies quick thinking saves him as she hooked him with her longbow.

Fed up with the treacherous descent after only a foot, Cirrus begins casting mold earth and extends the stair by 5ft and removing the snow and creating more even steps.

The stair is now easy and wide enough for the cats to descend.  Moogie shakes her head, chuckling, but the Orcs are simply flabbergasted and amazed and begin whispering that this group is chosen by Gruumsh to aid them.

The group easily makes it down to the boulders next to the river and notes a series of caves at the base of the cliff.

Turning and heading toward them, the group feels a stiff breeze flow out of the caverns, carrying with it a supernatural chill.

Fey feels necromancy on the unnatrual air while Cirrus and Tark both feel the stench of evil.

Approaching the entrance, the group lets their eyes adjust to the dark and see into the caverns, noting several tunnels and large rock pillars breaking up the large cavern.

Two dead and torn wolves are just inside the cavern entrance, brutally killed.

Tark and Cirrus head in, telling the Orcs to stay back.  Moogie translates and hangs back herself, with her dog Charles all but laying at her feet.

Sneaking in farther, Tark comes across two old Orc bodies, bloated and ravaged, laying in the dirt.

On closer inspection, the whole place seems to be undisturbed with no new prints and dust laying thick about the place.

The group hears movement and goes on guard, Tark spying a huge blue-glowing and ethereal looking giant Troll at the back of the cavern for a split second before it vanishes in a swirl of mist.

Cirrus looks up from examining a Wolf-corpse just in time to see the massive Spirit Troll burst out of the rock pillar in front of him, swinging massive claws at him.

The Troll slashes into Cirrus, ravaging his psyche and leaving him stunned.  The creature turns and dives back into the rock before anyone else can take action.

Everyone goes on the ready, preparing spells and arrows for when the creature reappears.

It dives from the rock above Tark, reaching out but catches a flashing spell from Fey, stunning the creature…but Tark as well.

Tark focuses his mind and shakes free of the spells effects, but it takes him a moment to compose himself.

Mr. Pickles sees a target and lets loose with his dual flintlocks, but the bullets pass right through the ghostly Troll, doing no damage.

Just then, a number of Orc Cadavers come shambling from around rock mounds, zombies drawn to the action.

The Orcs rush forward to attack the undead and Moogie is caught in the open by one of the cadavers.

Tark is rushed by one of the zombies, but it's flailing is nothing to the Monk and he shrugs off the blows.

Turning to fight Shadowclaw, Tark lays into the creature with a flurry of blows but the Troll flees, rushing past and diving into another rock formation, coming out on the other side and assaulting Fey and Moogie.

Cirrus recovers from the stunning blows of the Troll and is face to face with a Zombie. He releases a flurry of Eldritch blasts, smashing the creature back thirty feet into the wall where it explodes in a shower of gore.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pickles and the Cats have gone from Zombie to Zombie, flanking each and tearing them limb from limb one at a time.

Shadowclaw rushes Fey who calls forth a massive arcane construct, an Arcane Hand of force to fight the creature.

Seeing the powerful monster rushing his companions, Cirrus slams his staff down and a flash of light pulses out, a net of electrical energy springs into being around Shadowclaw and the creature stops suddenly, paralyzed.

Tark Shadowsteps to the Troll and begins laying into it.

The Orcs rush and surround the creature and with swings of their silver encrusted axes, begin chopping into it.

Cutting at it's essence Shadowclaw is finally being picked apart.  It finally breaks free from the paralysis and bellows in rage; a ghostly echoing note.

It rips into one of the Orcs, downing him and then turns, fleeing from the combat, taking numerous stinging hits.

Cirrus prays to Selune, healing the Orcs fatal injuries.

Fey turns and with a gesture, sends forth his Arcane Hand to snare and crush the Troll.

Just as the Troll leaps from the stone and rushes to a tunnel to flee, the Arcane hand grabs it by it's legs and holds on, dragging the Troll back.

Tark shadowsteps to it and with a heaving falling blow, smashes the Troll and it explodes in a blast of blue smoke and a ghostly echoing scream…

**Story time**

The Orcs huddle, tentative and unsure until a minute goes by and they begin cheering and slap each other on the back.

The group searches the cave but find nothing but the remains of the old camp and dead Orcs.

Searching the back of the caverns, they find two tunnels that go back into darkness and a third that gets so thin as to be un-traversable.

Moogie tells them that she's explored back a few thousand feet but turned back when it started to get too dangerous, entering the Upper-Dark.

Concerned, the group decides to get Gundren to block the tunnels when they return and then head out of the caves back to the stair up.

Cirrus repeats his performance and the group make it back to the top of the cliff without issues.

They walk to High-Hold, where a congregation of Orcs wait to see who would return, and when everyone does, whoops and cheers go up from the Tribe and the party is welcomed back into the ruins with open arms.

Everyone gathers around the large cauldron that Keek is cooking with and bowls of the Ankheg stew are handed out.

Over the hearty meal, Tark, Cirrus, Fey and Mr. Pickles tell the Orcs (and Moogie) their tale.  With Tark acting out the best parts.

The Orcs are convinced that the group is sent to them by their gods and the Tribe's attitude toward them, even though they are non-Orcs, is very positive.

Luumsh decides that they will settle in Old Kossenberg and use the Evermoor to fight, battle and practice.

He also mentions that he will gather other like-minded Tribes to them for the Great War that Tark mentions is coming, trusting the groups tale.

Moogie mentions that she's never heard a tale like the groups and is suitably impressed.

Mr. Pickles remarks that "They haven't even met the most powerful one!" referring to Patches.

The tales continue well into the early evening and it isn't until the sun begins to set that the Orcs realize what time it is and become uncomfortable.

The Orcs begin filing into the barracks and Luumsh and Keek explain what's happening.

Several specters and a Ghost have been haunting the ruins and hurting the Orcs whenever they are seen.

The group decides to take care of them and fix the Tribe's last issue.

Moogie remains behind, sitting with Keek around the fire, sharing stories.

Mr. Pickles and the cats remain behind as well, not wanting to rile up the ghosts.

Off in the distance along the ruined wall, an ethereal specter, energy wafting off it like smoke, materializes looking out over the Evermoor…
  

**The Ghost of High-Hold**

The trio heads toward the specter, past the ruins of the main keep.

As they pass the keep, they notice another specter standing guard at the entrance, rubble strewn at its feet.

They approach the specter and it does not acknowledge them until they speak to it in terms it can understand, mentioning the "impending" Orc invasion and that they are from Silverymoon to assist.

The spectral guard leads the group into the ruined keep, over rubble and through mostly destroyed corridors, ending at an "office".

What's left of the office is open to the night sky, a half moon shining down and the group sees a well dressed, ghostly man, leaning over a "desk"; the actual shattered desk lying on the ground and covered in a layer of snow.

They approach the long dead commander: Harold Ophrella.

They tell the ghost that they are here from Silverymoon to take over and that he and his family are to flee to Silverymoon.

Harold does not buy it at first, alternating between not paying attention and not understanding.

After several minutes and some tense moments where the Ghost appears to be on the verge of freaking out, Cirrus manages to get through to him.

With a sigh of relief, the ghost evaporates and the Specters pass on as well.

The trio head back, through the ruins, to the old Barracks and sit with Moogie and Keek.  They explain what happened and both old ladies are grateful.

Moogie mentions some other specters in Old Kossenberg, but she will handle them with the Orcs and begin to break it to the local human village that a bunch of Orcs will be living near by.

Luckily, she has a few months to work on it while the Orcs finish up wintering in the ruins.

The group settles down for the night in the Tiny Hut, teleporting to Sundabar the next morning.
  

**Meetup in Sundabar**

Arriving in the teleportation chamber in Sundabar, Cirrus hands over the platinum coins for the Teleport and the group heads out of the structure and into the Everfire chamber.

Getting their bearings, Fey leads the group off to Megnos workshop.

Patches, having been watching the South Vault for a few days now, has noticed increased patrols and noted their positions.  The most important thing she noticed though, was a halfling casing the joint as well...

Fey uses the Rockie talkie to let Patches know they are in town and Patches responds, saying she is heading back to Megnos place.

After a short, but very hot walk (passing the skimmers and forges) the group makes it to the Workshop and they knock.

The door is opened by Megnos apprentice, Molly and the girl shows the group into the Workshop before heading back to her little area.

Buumi and Tark hug and even Gundren greets them jovially, the work on Gwen almost finished.

Patches shows up a few minutes later and informs the group that they have deposited the majority of the coin, but held off on the artifact until everyone was here.

She also mentions that the Southern Vault is interesting her and she may want to look into it further...

Fey heads upstairs, looking for Megno and walks up to his friends office, knocking on the door.

A few moments later, the door swings open and a still battered looking Megno beams up at him.

Holding the ancient, crusty Dwarven Journal up in one hand, Megno greets Fey with "You're not gonna believe this!"
