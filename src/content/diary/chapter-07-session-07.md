**The Sleigh Ride and the Dream**

The sleigh whispers over the fresh alpine snow, making a rapid descent down the slopes of Shatterpeak and into the sparse trees.

Exhausted, the group lounges in the back, resting and taking turns handling the sled.

Healing prayers are whispered while bandages are passed around liberally.  One healers kit is completely spent.

About an hour into the ride, a shockwave overtakes the sleigh, shaking all the trees and dumping snow from their boughs.

Looking back at the mountain range, the group sees numerous avalanches kicked off by the shockwave and the rumble reaches them soon after.  The detonation of the Sanctum appears to have happened though it is lost in the low cloud cover of a winter storm now raging over the peaks.

The group leaves the vicinity of the storm, leaving near blizzard conditions and transitioning to a lazy snowfall.

Over the next eight hours, the group travels uneventfully, Fey studying the new spells and spellbooks while Cirrus prays to Selune, identifying the magical items they managed to procure from the Sanctum.

The group discovers that many of the items are quite valuable,  distributing the gear amongst themselves.  Megno looks on, unwilling to take a share himself but clarifying that his haul, and what the Dwarves of Sundabar paid for, was the trove of books.

Fey is a little put off at this, hoping to keep a number of the tomes themselves but is placated when Megno promises translated copies of all the tomes retrieved.

As they travel, on the second day the group sees a wild Wyvern swoop down and catch a Giant Elk, and marvel at the scale of the two beasts struggling to survive. 

That evening, the group settles down to sleep for the night, the moose gaining assistance from summoned mounts in pulling the sled, though the fast pace of the previous day has slowed significantly as the beasts tire.

Tark falls asleep, but is greeted by dark dreams

He dreams of his rescue from the barrow in Vaasa, where his family was murdered and he was saved by Gaddock.

In his dream though, he is not rescued, being left in the cage as the heroes take a different small boy to safety.

He's left, staring at the corpse of the man that killed his family; Li Xian, a necromancer.

Minutes turn into hours in the dark, dank barrow, the smell of blood and viscera overwhelming.  The nightmare is miserable.

Suddenly, the corpse of Li Xian moves, and sits up.  Terrible wounds covering him begin to close up and the man stands.

At the entrance to the barrow, a wood elf enters.  Tark recognises him as Neero, the Wood Elf/Oni that attacked them at the farm outside Silverymoon.

As the disguised Oni moves into the space, he transforms into his hulking purple-skinned form and approaches Li Xian, who also morphs into a monstrous Oni.

Seeing Li Xian in his true form, Tark recognizes its features.  He sees the revealed Oni bend down and pick up a wicked looking Flint knife and place it on his belt.

Tark sees that Li Xian, the man, the Oni that murdered his family in the service of Zhengyi, is the same Oni that he just saw in the Sanctum.  The Oni necromancer that attacked them.  

The dream ends with the two Oni approaching one another and conversing in an unknown tongue and Tark wakes up shaking and sweating.

He remembers the dream vividly and knows it to be a vision of the truth.

Tark calls out and the group wakes, Tark quickly relating his dream, tears falling from his face.

The group does not know what to do with the new information, but it confirms their suspicions that the Oni attacks are connected to them and to Zhengyi.

Tark retreats under a blanket and goes invisible, the group doing what they can to comfort him in his revelation. 

**Pay Day and Investigations**

 The next day comes and goes without issue and the group makes it back to Sundabar just as night falls.

Stopping by the stables by the East Gate, Megno returns the sled and a set of VERY tired Moose.  Retrieving his deposit, Megno is quite happy.

The group gathers their things and leaves the Sled behind, heading with Megno across the snowy bridge toward the magnificent fortress walls.

The group and Megno make it to the gates without issue and are recognized and allowed entry despite the late hour.

Heading through the snowy Uppercity, the group once again sees the newly constructed buildings and despite the chill winter air, a number of citizens are still going about their business, streets well lit by lanterns.

As the group heads through the familiar thoroughfare, heading toward the elevators to the Lowercity, the group begins catching some attention.

Being quite distinct and having now come through the city several times (and being involved in many large recent events) the party is beginning to be recognized by the general populace.

Indeed, as the group heads through the streets, many people begin to follow, whispering to one another and pointing.  Before too long, the group stops and Tark addresses a young lad nearby.

The boy confirms that the group is known throughout the city as word has reached them of their part stopping the Coup in Silverymoon.  Coupled with saving the Dwarf patrol and having walked out of the desert leaving a shattered castle (a story confirmed by the Explorer's League) and tales of an almost identical group saving the city of Baldur's Gate one year ago, people are beginning to talk and take note.

Buumi, wanting to play things up and impress the people with the glory of Helm unfurls his new wings - granted from a magical feather taken from The Sanctum.  Unfortunately, he has not quite gotten used to them and whacks a small child away (which is saved by Patches) and then knocks most of the group down as he spins in place.  He sheepishly puts them away after this debacle.

Getting off the snowy ground, a grumpy Fey asks what people know and they give some inaccurate highlights.  Tark steps in...and starting from the very beginning, begins telling the tale of the group.

Two hours go past and Tark looks around, the crowd mostly dispersed. The last person listening is an old man and Tark asks where everyone went.  The deaf old man responds incoherently and then wanders off too.  The bemused Monk looks around and then heads to Megnos place in the Lowercity.

Meanwhile, the group had kept meandering back to Megnos workshop, knowing that Tark would make his way down when he wanted to.

They're let in to the Workshop by Molly who motions everyone to The EVERSTEW and to help themselves.

The group throws down their things and gets comfortable, getting into comfier clothes and getting a bite to eat.

Megno heads up to his office and Tark shows up a good hour or so later.

As Tark shows up, Megno heads out, needing to check in with The Explorer's league before the office closes for the night.

With Tark now back with the group, Molly remembers that she got some mail and hands a letter to Patches.  Molly then tells Fey that a woman from "The Guild" showed up earlier in the day looking for him and she said she would be back the next day.

Cirrus bids his friends have a good night without him and sits down in a plush chair, pulling out an Analgesic grenade and preparing to huff it.

The group all gangs up on Cirrus, fed up with his strange addiction and the helpless state it puts him in.  Stepping in, Patches grabs the grenade, punctures it with the luckblade and throws the hissing container out the window and into the street.

The group looks at her, shocked and she shrugs. The group then turns to Cirrus and begins staging an intervention.  Cirrus feels attacked and points out the vices of everyone else, but no one is having it, as the paralyzing effects of the grenades are far worse than drinking or smoking.

Cirrus eventually relents and agrees to try and not do it anymore.  He does not tell anyone he has four more grenades in his pack.

Fey settles in for the night to study the new spells and the Iron-paged spellbook.

Meanwhile Buumi and Gundren go out drinking and Patches heads to the forge of Flamestoker, the Dwarven craftsment who helped her with her gun.

Patches meets with the old Dwarf just as he's catching up with some paperwork and discuss some new bullets.  Patches gets a steady supply set up in exchange for introducing Flamestoker to her source of higher quality gunpowder.

Tark takes his evening in a much different direction, deciding to hit the town and look for trouble.

As he heads through the well patrolled and policed undercity, he finds the place to be underwhelming in terms of evil to stomp.  A couple of rambunctious Dwarves being a little loud does not fit his definition and he avoids the ruckus.  Eventually, Tark makes it through one of the residential districts and passes an interesting scene out side an inn called the Short and Curlies.

As he looks over the inn, Tark sees numerous guards milling about the place and a Dwarven Cleric exiting the front door and descending the steps.  Sneaking in close, Tark begins to evesdrop as the Cleric starts talking with the guard captain.

After a few moments, Tark discerns that there were three murders in the Tavern a few days ago (The Zhentarim Patches killed) and that it was a very clean hit as none of the deceased spirits could tell the cleric what killed them or how.  Sighing, the Cleric retires for the night and the Dwarven guards head on out a few minutes later.  As they go, the captain recognizes Tark and approaches, letting the halfling know that they will be at Megnos in the morning to question him and Patches as they were placed at the scene of the Bank Heist and the three dead here were the team responsible.

Tark doesnt quite know if he's a suspect or not but agrees to be ready for questioning the next day.

Tark heads into the Inn.

The place is near deserted, what with the murders.

Tark sits at the bar and strikes up a conversation with the owner and bartender.

After a few drinks (which Tark is now immune to) he manages to get the Dwarven woman to begin talking about what she saw the night of the murders.  Which is not much.

What she does remember though is a dark and mysterious female figure descending the stairs from the rooms and passing her.

Tark finishes his drink, pays 5s and leaves with the much more valuable bottle...

Back at Megnos, Tark bursts into the workshop and tells everyone (as everyone, including Megno has returned by now) about the murder investigation and that he and Patches are suspects!

Patches sighs and makes some calculations.

She stands up and comes clean, telling the group that she killed them on orders from Lady Faye, that she is her sword and that these kills were Zhentarim agents.

Tark is horrified and cannot comprehend the murders as anything other than evil and is disgusted with Patches.  Everyone else is taken a back, though only Buumi takes real issue with the killings, saying that due process should have been followed.  Knowing that Lady Faye is a noble of Baldur's Gate and trusting Patches that these were indeed Zhentarim agents, Buumi is not happy, but he does not make a huge fuss over it either.

Tark storms upstairs and knocks on Megnos study.  The Dwarf opens the door and gets an earful from an Irate Tark.  Megno tries to placate the monk by telling him they would have been executed anyway for their crimes.  This does not make the Halfling feel better.

Swearing, Megno heads down to the common room and inquires himself.  He nods, sighs, and heads out to the Intelligence Office to try and brush this under the rug.  He returns an hour later saying it had been taken care of and then promptly heads upstairs to sleep.

The group decides to sleep and turn in for the evening.

**Neverwinter**

​The next day, the group is awoken by Molly coming into the workshop and heading to her desk.

The group groggily begins making breakfast and getting ready for the day.

A still grumpy Tark won't look at Patches.

An hour after the magical lights of the city begin to resemble dawn, a knock is heard at the front door.

Molly answers it and opens the door to find a beautiful, bald, caramel skinned elf woman in wizards robes.

The woman steps inside and introduces herself as Ossea, a representative of The Guild.

Fey steps forwards and they begin to talk.

The group finds out that Ossea has with her the sigil for the teleportation gate of Neverwinter, paid for by Esimir Von Bumidere, Buumi's father.  There is one condition though.  Before she will hand over the Sigil, Fey must agree to join The Guild.  This means paying 200pp a year and being a formal member (with responsibilities), however, the guild will build a teleportation ring for him in the place of his choosing and travel fees will be waived for him and anyone traveling with him.

Fey sees it as manipulative and does not trust Ossea or this "Guild" but he agrees and the Sigil is handed over.

Ossea informs Fey that a guild meeting is to be held in six months and a sigil will be supplied nearer the time.

She then takes her leave, saying goodbye (though heatedly) to Megno who obviously has some history with the woman.

The group returns to their morning, only for another knock about a half hour later.

A very short and wide Dwarf enters the workshop a moment later, the door evidently being unlocked and addresses the room.

Introducing himself as Muldren Shaw, the raspy voiced and black haired Dwarf says he is an Inspector and is here to discuss the murders.

He says he was informed by Megno of the circumstances and is not here to dole out punishment, but is looking to hire Patches for a job needing similar skills.

this is the last straw for Tark and he leaps from the table and attempts to grapple the stout Dwarf and toss him out the window.

The Dwarf twists away and Buumi pulls the infuriated halfling back.

Patches proposes they take the discussion outside and the dwarf agrees, leaving the blustering halfling with his friends.

Outside, the Dwarf proclaims his admiration for the killings and mentions that he knows Patches as a Drow, an agent from Baldur's Gate and an assassin and he wants her help with two targets.

He informs her that word is starting to get around about The Council of Helm's Hold, so much so that anyone who is anyone will be there or at least be sending a representative.

That includes Amn.

And who better than their ambassador to Silverymoon, newly ransomed and a free man once more: Abdul Al Selemchant, Cousin to Shaahir Al Selemchant, the Archmage responsible for the Coup of Silverymoon (failed) and the man who killed Muldren's son in the attack.

The second target is S'Olaa Al Kayan, Shaahir's apprentice and brother to Cirrus.

The wide Dwarf insinuates that Patches cooperation would mean a stalling of the investigation in town and that she should practice her trade at The Council.  He then leaves.

Patches returns to the group and tells them she is to protect Abdul Al Selemchant at the Council from assassins...Everyone believes her.  

Tark suspects...something though. 

The group pack up and head out to buy some supplies before they leave Sundabar.

As they leave, they bid Megno and Molly farewell, convincing Megno that his presence at the Council would go a long way, especially his account of what happened at The Sanctum.  They then head to The Guild teleportation Circle.

They are let into the Guild house without issue and are in fact warmly welcomed as Fey is a new Guild member and is even presented with a glass of wine and a tray of hot, moist towlettes.

Refreshed, the group powers up the circle and step into it.

In a flash of light, they find themselves transported...and separated.

Fey, Patches, Gwen and Buumi look around and find themselves in Neverwinter (Buumi confirms) but in the Bluelake district, the fancy part of town and not farm from Buumi's family estate.

Fey thinks for a moment and concentrates, trying to figure out what happened to the teleport.  Thinking, he gets a flash of insight and realizes that it is simply a safety precaution of the rings, he teleported the same instant another traveler was and was safely redirected nearby.  He remembers the *feel* of that other travelers energy and thinking on it, he recognizes it and sighs heavily...  Mordenkainen.

Tark and Gundren look around, finding themselves in an alleyway of a shanty-town, the outer wall of Neverwinter city looming above the ramshackle buildings.  Looking about, they have no idea where they are...but it does not look like a nice neighborhood.  A few drunks and dirty folk scamper away from the sudden, new arrivals.

Across town, Cirrus looks down into the rift with his chrome orbs "seeing" the vast chasm walls now covered in construction.  Houses, elevators and cranes have been erected and this part of the city, unlike before, is bustling and busy with activity, new buildings apparent everywhere.

As cirrus turns, seeing only eighty feet out but feeling much more, he stops, sensing an energy and one that fills him with emotion.  He feels the warlock he was tasked to hunt.  Another Warlock of Ceregorach, the Tooth Fairy...his prey is near.
