The group exits the pyramid and takes stock of the situation.

While they now have all the crests, they have the problem of being stalked by a creature Hazzim refers to as an “Alghoul”

When questioned, Hazzim says that it is a creature of legend, a source of lesser ghouls, disgusting eggs and a boogeyman that drags people into dark caves.

Disgusted that people under his care have already been taken by this “Alghoul” Buumi insists that they lay an ambush for the thing.

The group waits in the nearby pyramid, Snorbul buries himself in the stone and waits, while Tark is bait for the thing outside.

They wait for about an hour before Tark is accosted.

The creature leaps from concealment, attacking Tark in an ambush.

Luckily, Tark’s cloak of displacement saves him and Tark manages to rush back from the creature and to the door of the Pyramid.

He bangs on the door and the group springs forth just as Snorbul leaps from beneath the ground.

They surround and pummel the creature.

With every wound, the creature sprays acid across the attackers, burning the group as badly as its claws gouge them.

With a scream, the creature bounds away and disappears - it’s camouflage hiding it well.

Feanon unleashes a blast of cold over the nearby cliff wall, the creature though is nowhere to be found.

Cirrus tried his hand, summoning a sickening radiance and the dour light afflicts the creature.

Beneath the nearby cliffside, the group sees a subtle glow from the sickened creature and Tark leaps at it.

He strikes the nearly invisible Alghoul, finally killing the creature in a spray of acidic blood.

The group hauls the corpse back onto the flat ground and they gather, inspecting the thing.

It is a mass of claw and muscle and infused with dark power related to the corrupting webbing around the place.

The group, tired from the fight, retreat into the nearby pyramid, setting traps and alarms and barring the door before casting a Magnificent Mansion spell.

The group retires and rests for the evening.

While on watch that night, Feanon spies a swarm of machina beetles moving through the mind, scanning the area.  He does not interfere with them.

Meanwhile, Buumi asks Hazzim about the dark god Zalaam and if there are any other legends or stories Hazzim knows.

The man is not a wellspring of information but relays that Zalaam was a god of death and darkness, but was balance as well.  A thousand years ago though the Saurians destroyed that balance and ever since, Zalaam has been in ascendance.

Buumi chats with the man while baking some treats, but Patches ends up interrupting.

She shows up and asks if Cirrus has recent issue with her.

Buumi points out that Cirrus was awfully miffed that Patches has Moonfire and the warlock seemingly does not.

As they chat though, they theorize that his eyes are likely moonfire and realizing this, Patches goes to chat and confront Cirrus.

Cirrus denies any jealousy and agrees that his eyes (gift from the goddess that they were) are definitely moonfire…

After her chat with Cirrus, Patches moves on to talk with Feanon, telling the wizard that she has spied his first clone.

She asks if its worth it so far and he says that it really is.

She warns him about Manshoon and the instability of that Archmage’s clones and the resulting issues.

Feanon waves the issue away, saying that history is the best teacher and he wont make the same mistakes.

Everyone is skeptical.

The group packs up their camp and moves out of the private pyramid room, moving back into the mines.

As they continue heading back to the main pyramid and control room they come across a side passage blocked by some kind of metal door and contraption.

Tark and Patches investigate while the group remains at the mouth of the side passage.

They realize the contraption is an airlock of sorts and they pass through it.

On the other side….they see a chamber full of horror.

Filled with dark webs, black tar and egg-sacks in the hundreds, hunched figures mill about the eggs - Ghouls.

One in particular stands out - the burned and twisted form of the cultmember the group called “Baconbitz”

Tark and Patches reseal the door and retreat.

The ghouls rush forwards and begin to force the door.

The group prepares for the fight, readying the tunnel with traps and spells.

As the ghouls break down the door and rush forwards, they sense the danger and begin to climb over the walls.

The group holds them at the chokepoint and begin to destroy the creatures, though they prove to be far tougher than the average ghouls the party has faced.

The things launch twisted tentacles and corrupted attacks at the group, but with another casting of sickening radiance and attacks raining down on the creatures, they are destroyed.

The group makes sure they are dead and burn the corpses while they let Cirrus’ sickening radiance burn the chamber clear of eggs and corruption.

Moving into that chamber, they then scour the nearby minecarts for resources, grabbing more sourcestones and a few runestones - which they ask Hasrala what they do.

Moving on, the group returns to the main Pyramid and insert the crests.

The platform begins to gather a magical charge, a teleport, and the group ascends the dais and are transported.

Arriving in a deeper section of the mine, maybe many miles away from their last location, they find themselves in a well crafted and well maintained section.

On guard for cult members, the group moves in actively searching for traps as they go.

They spot several warding glyphs and avoid them as they move into the area.

As the group heads into a larger chamber, Patches calls out a warning just as several hidden cultists strike from the concealed shadows.

They lash out at the group with their dark magic, but the group quickly overwhelms the three of them.

The cultists turn to flee but one is cut down.  The other two flee down nearby hallways.

Buumi and Tark rush in pursuit of one and Gundren rushes after the other.

Buumi and Tark cut down their quarry, but the other gets away, fleeing deeper into the complex…
