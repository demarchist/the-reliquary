The group thinks up a strategy.  

They want to assault and kill this dark cult.

They measure the teleportation rings and figure out that, their Delzoun Instant Fortress will fit.

They throw down the Adamantite tower and Gundren speaks the password and the model tower rapidly expands to its 20ft height (each wall be ten feet across).

All of the ranged get in the tower, along with the NPC’s Hazzim and Raveel while the melee characters press themselves to the rear exterior of the tower, able to rush into combat from behind it and secure the teleportation controls.

They activate the teleporter and the tower and its occupants are transported in a flash of magical energies.

In the other chamber, the Cultists, though ready for an attack - are momentarily stunned by the appearance of a massive Adamantite tower.

All hell breaks loose as the fortified cultists open fire with a barrage of Saurian Firelances, striking the magical tower with great blasts.

The group returns fire, ripping one cultist apart, though it quickly regenerates and regains its footing - these things must be killed with fire!

Buumi, Tark, Snorbul and Patches all rush around the tower exterior, slaying cultists in their path, but they dont stay down long, regenerating until Feanon can burn them with a firebolt.

Cirrus spots a juicy target and traps the majority of the Cultists, including the leadership (with a shadowy blade!) inside a Dome of Force, effectively splitting the enemy force.

Though separated, the Cultists inside the dome can still strike out with magical attacks, forcing Feanon to unleash a powerful gravity spell to restrain and damage all those inside, forcing continual concentration checks.

All save the cult leader are smashed to the ground, gravity slowly crushing the life from them even as their regeneration fights to heal them.

The shadow-blade wielding leader sees that she cannot win this fight, pulls a whistle from around her neck and blows it.

A Hypersonic shriek reverberates out, passing through the magical dome and the cracked and porous rock of the chamber.

Off in the distance, the sounds of dozens of Alghouls can be heard as they screech in reply, rushing to the call.

Behind the dome of force, the Ringed Veil platform stands idle.

With the blowing of the whistle, Raveel and Hazzim both begin to panic, telling those in the Delzoun Fortress that they have to flee through the Veil and shut it behind them, otherwise they will all be overwhelmed and die.

Indeed, even as they say this, the first few Alghouls and their spawn pull themselves from the cracks in the wall and rush into combat.

As the melee force pivots to the new threat, they are splashed and burned with their enemies acidic blood and realize that this is not a battle they can win with conventional tactics.

Looking around the battlefield, the group sees precious few thinking enemies, and those that are leading this cult are trapped within a dome of force - separated from any help.

The Melee thunderstep, burrow and shadowstep into the Dome of Force and smash into the cultist leadership inside still being crushed by the Gravity well.

As the leaders are hacked apart, the only one unrestrained brandishes her shadowblade, battling Tark to no avail and even being disarmed at one point.

Alghouls continue to pour into the cavern, rushing toward the only targets they can really see - those fighting in the dome, though they cannot get to them.

The unintelligent monsters rake and claw at the dome, unable to get inside.

In the Delzoun fortress, the casters extricate themselves from a restraining spell and leave the tower, getting on the summoned Winged Owlbear Arkto and flying into the air, staying out of reach of the horde of monsters.

Before they leave though, Feanon deep slumbers Hazzim and then drags out Raveel in chains.

Cirrus then wakes Hazzim, but before the man can react, is dropped into a Demi-plane (everyone else not knowing this).

Arkto flies across the large chamber, taking fire from the only surviving cult members wielding staff weapons and then hovers over the dialing device, Feanon working to dial it with his Mage-Hand and provide an escape.

As they hover, Gundren returns fire with his Cannon and even rings the Dome of Force with a wall of fire, burning and killing many in the horde.

Eventually, even the monsters are driven back by the wall of fire and rush across the cavern to slaver and rave beneath the flying group, unable to reach them.

Patches hides underneath the dial, pressing herself against it and praying to Elistraee that her Piwawfi will hide her…

Inside the burning Dome of Force, Buumi and Snorbul hack apart the restrained foes and then burn them before they can regenerate while Tark duels the Cult Leader.

The lone surviving cult leader is then cornered against the dome and hacked apart by Snorbul as the three of them surround her.

Seeing the horde of monsters outside waiting to attack, Tark takes the whistle from the now dead cult leader and shadowsteps outside the dome of force as far as he can and blows the whistle.

The horde shrieks and they rush across the chamber to Tark, ignoring the flying group that was frustrating them.

Feanon finishes dialing and the Ringed Veil shimmers to life in a blaze of arcane power and Arkto dives through, Tensers disk trailing behind carrying the extra characters.

Snorbul and Buumi Thunderstep from the dome, the shockwave splattering and ripping apart the remains left behind in the Wall of Force.

Snorbul rushes through the portal, leaving Buumi to wait for Tark.

Tark shadowsteps beside his friend and they depart Faerun together, heading to the dark world of Al Askar.
