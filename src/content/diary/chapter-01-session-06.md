Gundren caught up to the group outside the Spellforge chamber and demanded to know where the forge had gone. Upon learning it had been absorbed into the jade frog — now a growing golem — the party pressed on toward the domain of Mormesk.

## Mormesk the Wraith

Scouting ahead, the group found poisonous moss growing along the corridor. Patches scraped a sample to cultivate later. Tark, peering through his enchanted blindfold into the world of magic, saw the long-dead wizard staring at them from his abode with undisguised menace.

Mormesk flew out as a wraith, summoning a wight and a spectre from the ancient corpses littering the ground. The battle was fierce but decisive — Doctor Breakfast landed the killing blow on Mormesk with her fire magic. The group looted his ancient quarters, finding 50 gold, his old spellbook, and a rather nice mahogany desk.

## Freeing the Spectators

Returning to the Spectators, the group attempted to trick Igi and Gladi into serving them directly. The Spectators, however, proved cleverer than expected and turned the tables — the party ended up freeing them from their vigil without gaining any further service.

With the guardians gone, the party claimed the two treasures from the Spellforge chamber: a Breastplate +1 that granted immunity to dragon breath, and the Coat of the Cerulean — a longcoat that could cast Mass Cure Wounds once per long rest.

## The Black Spider

Rested and re-equipped, the group headed for the Black Spider's lair on the far side of the chasm. They found a locked room they couldn't get into or see inside, then approached the grand doors of the Temple of Dumathoin.

Patches went in first, with Fëanon disguised as a Drow. The rest of the group hid inside the Tavern of Doors — and for reasons known only to themselves, painted themselves purple.

Inside the temple, Fëanon and Patches found Lo'Dan and his retinue of Drow elite. Another Drow arrived, brushing past the disguised Fëanon without a second glance.

The group quickly discovered that Lo'Dan was deeply unhappy with the progress Nezzan — the Black Spider — had made with the Spellforge. So unhappy, in fact, that Lo'Dan offered to let the party deal with Nezzan themselves while his Drow watched.

## The Execution of Nezzan

The battle with Nezzan was intense. Furious at Lo'Dan's betrayal, the Black Spider fought with desperate ferocity. But the party had the advantage of numbers and the Drow audience had no intention of intervening.

When the group finally brought Nezzan to his knees, he begged for his life. Gundren — whose brother had died because of this Drow's scheming — told him to suck it, then blew his head off with his thundercannon.

The Drow elite applauded the performance. Lo'Dan told the group to travel to Neverwinter, where they would have a task for them. Then the Drow vanished into their magical darkness.

## Loot and Revelations

From Nezzan's body they recovered Elven Chain +1, a Staff of Spiders, scrolls of Web and Cloudkill, a bottle of Drow spirits, and 50 gold. They also found a key — the one for the locked room they'd passed earlier.

Inside, they found Gundren's last surviving brother, tortured horribly and repeatedly healed to prolong his suffering. He was essentially comatose. The party carried him gently into the Tavern of Doors.

Inside the box, the Tavern had continued to grow. The main rooms — common room, stage, bar, kitchen, upstairs hallway, living rooms, and the magical focus room — were now fully formed. The specialty rooms were still developing.
