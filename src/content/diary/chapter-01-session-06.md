Gundren catches up to the group outside the spell forge and demands to know where the forge is, upon discovering it's in the frog, they discover the frog is a Golem and it's growing.

Heading down the hall, the group approaches the old domain of Mormesk.

The group scouts the area, finding poisonous moss, Patches grabs a sample to cultivate it for later.

Seeing into the world of magic, tark sees the now dead wizard looking at the group menacingly from the abode

He flies out as a wraith and attacks the group, summoning a wight and spectre from ancient corpses on the ground.

The group battles the monsters and defeats them, the killing blow on mormesk coming from Dr. B and her fire

The group proceeds to loot the ancient abode of mormesk finding: 50gp, his old spellbook and a nice mahogany desk.

Going back to the Spectators, the group chats with them and attempts to trick them into serving the group, but the group is tricked themselves and the Spectators are freed. 

The group then loots the Breastplate +1 (immune to dragon breath) and the Coat of the Cerulean  (Mass cure wounds once per long rest)

The group rests up and then heads off to the lair of the Black Spider

They come across a locked room just before the Spider but cannot get in or see inside.

Approaching the grand doors to the temple of Dumathoin, Patches decides to go inside with Fey disguised as a Drow.

The rest of the group is within the ToD and stupidly paint themselves purple…

After a quick discussion with Lo'Dan and his group of Drow Elite, another drow shows up brushing past Fey.

The group discovers that Lo'Dan is unhappy with the progress that Nezzan made with the spell forge, so much so that they allow the group to exact their vengeance upon him without interfering, in fact watching the whole spectacle.

The group battles Nezzan epicly (who is pissed at Lo'Dan for throwing him to the wolves)

The group gets Nezzan on his last legs and he begs for his life, Gundren, whose brother was slain, tells him to suck it, before blowing his head off with his thundercannon.

The drow clap at the performance and tell the group to head to Neverwinter where they have a task for them

The drow then disappear using their darkness.

The group loots Elven Chain +1 from Nezzan, a Staff of Spiders, web, cloudkill, a bottle of Drow Spirits and 50gp

They get a key as well and open the room they could not get into, inside they find Gundrens last brother, tortured horribly and healed, he is essentially comatose.

The group heads into ToD bringing the brother, inside the Tavern has finished growing the main rooms (common room, stage, bar, kitchen, upstairs hallway and living rooms, magical focus room) the specialty rooms are still growing.
