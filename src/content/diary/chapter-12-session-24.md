The Death Lord looks to be in a dire situation as the tide of the battle turns, but he still has some tricks to play.

He raises a gauntleted hand, the sourcestone embedded into the back of the hand glowing brightly.  He hurls a fiery orb of purple and dark swirling energy toward the group.

Feanon reaches out to Counterspell but realizes that the orb of energy cannot be countered.

It detonates in an explosion of fire and shadow, badly burning the group and causing Thorna to lose concentration on the banishment spell.

The Death Lord then dispels the bright light from Gundren’s gemstone and then assaults Buumi, wounding the paladin badly and causing his Aura of Purity to falter.

The battle seems to turn once more.

Cirrus sees how hurt all his companions are, and with the faltering Paladin Aura, knows that only he can save everyone.

He lets the Banishment of the other Retriever end, and then leaps into the air on dark wings, beginning to glow with a Holy Aura, reinvigorating his allies and causing discomfort and distraction to the enemies.

The group rallies as healing spells are doled out extensively as the damage dealers surround and pummel the Death Lord.

The T-Rex nearest to the Retrievers block the metal spider’s way, forcing the dark constructs to battle the prehistoric beasts.

They lash out with beams of magic that paralyze the dinosaurs.

The Death Lord has the last of his Mirror Images destroyed by Tark, but the Haste spell persists, allowing the Death Lord to move and react faster than the group.

He moves among the group, slashing with his wicked sword.

But for all the damage he deals, he receives just as much in turn and as the last of his Boneclaws and minions are destroyed, he tries to flee the battle.

His gauntlet once again glows and the storm of wild magic surges overhead as the ancient Saurian attempts to teleport.

Feanon manages to counter the magic, forcing the Saurian to stay and fight.

The group focuses their fire on the Death Lord, who staggers under the assault.

With a hissing growl, he stands and enacts his teleport again, this time managing to flee into the aether.

The remaining undead minions are quickly destroyed by the many holy auras of the group and they turn to stalling the Retrievers.

Then, just as the group is about to bring the battle to the spider creatures in Earnest, they blink out of existence in a shower of energy and then moments later, the dinosaurs vanish as well in a burst of wild magic.

The group looks around in a bit of confusion and Tark marches toward Jareem.

He punches the dragon in the face and then demands to know if this was a set up.

The dragon appears to barely notice the strike but looks around the battlefield, his demeanor showing Tark that he is also surprised and confused by what just happened.

When Tark demands why he did not transform into his Dragon-shape, Jareem responds that he felt it was not the best form for that battle - from the size, architecture and needs of the fight.  After all, shapeshifting for him is no small effort, and jumping back and forth can be quite tiring and he needs to be small to enter the temple.

This does not satisfy Tark and he storms off to Buumi and the other healers as healing spells are cast on the group.

They decide to split the party with Buumi, Patches, Cirrus and Feanon staying in a magnificent mansion on the outside wall of the temple while the others descend into the temple to cleanse it by Jareems request.

Those in the mansion eagerly await the groups return from the depths so they can begin their flight to Thueba Swamp.

The party descends into the temple, defeating the first puzzle: a maze of fire walls.

With Gundren and Jareem being immune to fire, they made their way through the maze with methodical precision.

Moving down to the next level, the group finds themselves in a chamber with lava for the floor, save the central dais.

Around the outside are switches that the group discovers must be depressed simultaneously.

With two of the group able to walk over the lava, they easily press the buttons and then traverse to the next level.

Before they teleport to the next chamber though, Jareem asks the group to step back, as it is time for him to change shape - the next chamber is the trial of strength, and the group is wounded. 

There’s a flash of ruby light and Jareem’s humanoid form twists and changes. Crackling stone and glittering crystal growths erupt and a massive Dragon exists where before there was a man.
