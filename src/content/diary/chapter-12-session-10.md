The group looks around

They are seemingly back in the real world and they see one another.

Tark immediately goes into shock, having been fighting for a seeming eternity.

He falls over and goes invisible.

Everyone else looks around, noting a chamber almost identical to the ones above.

They begin to tentatively question one another what they all just saw.

All of a sudden, the Voice of the temple booms out in the chamber - “Bring Order to the Chaos!”

Creatures burst forth from the walls to attack.

Beset again by Stonework constructs animated by powerful magics, the group springs into action.

Cirrus leaps high into the air, borne aloft by Black angel wings and calls out.

He cries that he has found his purpose! To bring Selune to THIS world!

He then rends the air and a celestial being appears and immediately begins to attack the foes.

Buumi meanwhile begins to glow with a Holy Nimbus, striking with holy power again!

Gundren begins a barrage of shots with his Firelance

Feanon unleashes a hail micro-meteorites and begins to shell the opponents.

Snorbul hacks through the minions while Tark chases the main boss around the Arena as it teleports from person to person.

The group battles, the tide shifts in their favor, and they destroy the Stonework constructs

The dais in this room activates and they take it one level lower.

This chamber looks different.

This large cavernous expanse of solid rock is illuminated by an orange magical aura, with tiny otherworldly particles floating around. In the center of the ceiling of stone, hangs an alien tree-like plant with tentacles growing down towards a basin carved into the stone floor of the chamber.  Wide and shallow, it is filled with eerily still water, occasionally broken by a droplet falling from the plant above.  The whole area hums with potent magic.

Tark moves to the basin and drinks the water, feeling invigorated and pure

Liara moves to investigate the basin as well and Buumi follows.

Buumi and Liara both reach into the pool, seeing glowing pearls

They each take one.

No one else can see the pearls and both Buumi and Liara are infused with power.

Liara begins to tear up and thanks the group profusely for helping her get this far.

She is earnest

Feanon speaks up after examining the magics here, he explains that if the group spends some time here, it will greatly help with controlling the wild magic surges.

They move to the pool and begin to meditate
