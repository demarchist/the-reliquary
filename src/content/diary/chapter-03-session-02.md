The tavern owner rewarded the group with free food and drink for saving the establishment. While they ate, they noticed a Tiefling in rags across the room who caught their eye. The group sent over some free food and he began to ingratiate himself with them. The city guard arrived shortly after, sending JmJm into a deranged panic.

After the group explained the night's events, the guard offered them a contract: clear the catacombs beneath the city for a hefty five thousand gold reward — the Tiefling negotiating the fee up on their behalf before they even asked. The group readily agreed. They also learned that the local archmage, Amaram, wanted to hear any information about the mists.

## The Brotherhood

Heading through the city toward the archmage, the group came across a merchant tied to a stake, about to be burned alive by fanatics and a mob. The Brotherhood — a cult that had sprung up in the wake of the undead crisis — claimed the merchant was a necromancer. Fëanon quelled the mob with a magnificent display of magical power while Tark offered kind words, and JmJm made the crowd more receptive with subtle enchantment. Just as the cultists were about to escalate, a squad of Paladins of Lathander arrived to free the merchant.

The group bullied the grateful merchant into offering a reward, though he tried to weasel out of it. They followed the Paladins back to their temple, where the Grand Master asked them to investigate the Brotherhood. The order knew the cultists had found a few legitimate necromancers at first, but the purges were spiraling into witch hunts. The group initially declined, but Doctor Breakfast and Buumi circled back to accept, negotiating rare spell scrolls as payment.

## The Archmage

The group made it to the Mage's Guild and convinced the Door Golems to let them inside. They explored the tower and eventually found Amaram, to whom they recounted the full story — the mists, the artifact, Orcus, Kangaxx's betrayal. It shed considerable light on the situation for the archmage. He said he would research Orcus and the artifact but needed at least a few days.

## The Catacombs

The group headed to the heavily guarded graveyard district to begin clearing the catacombs. Lothli meditated to sense the undead below and determined that a veritable army of them filled the tunnels beneath the graveyard. Knowing this, the group descended into one of the larger mausoleums anyway. The foyer was empty, but in the first major chamber below, the newest bodies had risen as zombies. The group destroyed them quickly.

More tunnels stretched out before them, and from the darkness came the scraping and shuffling of the walking dead.
