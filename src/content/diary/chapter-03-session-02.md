The group is rewarded by the tavern owner for saving them, being given free food and drink while the group rests up and awaits the city guard.  Across the tavern, they see a Tiefling in rags that catches their eye.  The group sends him over some free food and drink and he begins to ingratiate himself with the group.  The city guard arrives relatively quickly, putting JmJm in a deranged panic.

The group explains what happened to the city guard, and he asks the group if they would be interested in clearing out the catacombs for a hefty 5000 gold reward (after the new tiefling negotiates a bit for them).  The group readily agrees.  The group also hears that the local archmage; Amaram would like to hear any information on the mists.  The group heads off into the city in the direction of the archmage.  On the way however, they come across a merchant tied to a stake, ready to be burned alive by some fanatics and a mob.  The Brotherhood (cultists) claim that the merchant is a necromancer, and they are cleansing the wicked.  The group quickly talks the mob down, winning them over with a magnificent magical display of power by Fey and some kind words from Tark (while the bard made them more receptive).  Just as the cultists are about to take things up a notch, a squad of Paladins of Lathander - the morning lord - arrive to assist and free the merchant.  The group bullies the merchant into offering a reward, but he attempts to get out of it.  The group follows the Paladins back to their temple, where the Grand Master  asks the group to help with The Brotherhood, he knows there's something fishie about them but they don't have the manpower to investigate with all the undead attacks.  They know the Brotherhood did in fact find a few legitimate necromancers at first, but now things appear to be going the route of a witch hunt.  The group initially declines the quest and head off to the Archmage, Doc B and Buumi head back however to say they will help and in exhange are offered some rare spell scrolls upon completion.

The group makes it to the Mage's guild and manage to convince the Door Golems to let them inside.  The group explores the tower and eventually find the archmage and tell him what's been happening.  It sheds a great deal of light on the fog for Amaram.  It's still not too much to go on, but Amaram says he will do some research on Orcus and on the artifact the group now has but that it will take a few days at least.

the group heads off to the catacombs to clear them out.  Upon arriving at the well guarded district, Lothli meditates to try to sense the undead in the area and determines that a veritable army of them fill the tunnels beneath the graveyard.  Knowing this, the group decides to head into one of the larger mausoleums anyways.  The foyer is empty, but descending into the first major room, the group finds the newest bodies as zombies and quickly destroys them.

With more tunnels reaching out before them, the group takes a moment - hearing the scraping a shuffling of the walking dead.
