## The Amber Hall

Cyrrus leaned against the wall, pale and bloodstained, as the group descended into the lower level of the Amber Temple. A vast hall stretched before them, coated in glittering amber, its alcoves lined with alabaster familiar statues. Patches went first, methodically disabling pressure plates along the floor and a trapped door. Tark wandered to the amber-glazed hallway connecting to the main chamber and stared at his reflection — only to realise it was not mimicking his movements. It was screaming at him to flee.

The group raided the familiar statues — each one trapped, each trap outsmarted — and stowed them in the bag of holding. The hall branched into ruined bedrooms, an angry poltergeist that threw furniture at them until they retreated, and three amber vault chambers. Two were sealed behind massive slabs. The third stood open. Fëanon sensed four curious minds within and went to investigate.

Inside the open vault, three alcoves held huge amber crystals — two intact with orange light swirling within, one shattered, its pieces littering the ground. From the shadows, four hunched and scaly figures with single enormous green eyes peered at the group. The Nothics spoke telepathically in unison: they would trade secrets for secrets. Tark stepped forward and showed them his scars.

## The Visions

A flash of light consumed everything.

The group stood in a rough-hewn barrow. A necromancer in the sigil of Zhengyi worked a bloody dagger at a sacrificial altar, surrounded by orcs and undead, a pile of dead civilians beneath him. In a corner cage, a small halfling boy stared at a dead halfling girl atop the pile. The real Tark stood numb, watching himself as a child. The barrow entrance burst inward and an adventuring party blazed in — a tortle with a halberd, a centaur, a fiery sorceress, an elderly druid, and a plain-looking man who became a whirlwind of punches and kicks. The plain man reached the cage, smashed the lock, and pulled out the teary-eyed child-Tark.

Another flash. Absolute darkness, then the gleam of obsidian archways, dark gems, and marble statues of elven women. Every surface was carved with spider and web designs, a magnificent onyx statue of Lolth framed by ornate columns. A young Patches — Aliyah — knelt at the feet of a Drow high priestess. More priestesses emerged from the shadows, pulling snake-headed whips from their hips. They beat her. They berated her. The eldest leaned in and whispered: she would join them, or die. The real Patches turned away.

A flash. An opulent human birthing chamber. The midwife looked up in horror — the baby was a grey Tiefling. The nobleman killed the servants, threw the devilspawn at his weeping wife, and demanded she kill it. Flash forward: the child alive, raised as a peasant, his mother secretly supporting him. Flash: an adolescent Cyrrus, grifting on the streets, caught and thrown in jail. His mother visited him — was followed — and her husband had her killed, framing Cyrrus for the murder. He sat cradling her body in his cell, praying to anyone. A great toothy smile erupted in the shadows, larger than anything human, and promised that help had arrived.

A flash. A magnificent elven city drenched in silver light — white and green marble, soft music, graceful Eladrin. An earthquake shattered it. The sun went dark. Meteors of blue flame streaked across the sky. Elves fell dead by the score. A child — Fëanon — knelt crying as the world collapsed around him. Flash forward: an older Fëanon stepping uncertainly off a boat onto a snowy dock, Baldur's Gate looming behind him. He pulled his hood up to hide his Eladrin features and set his jaw against the cold.

A flash. A manor house, summer light through an ornate window. A young red-haired boy of eight fought a younger girl with wooden swords. She was better — landing hit after hit. She cracked one of his fingers. He dropped his weapon, shoved her in rage, and she tumbled down a long flight of stairs with a series of sickening cracks. Buumi ran down to her still form, crying.

A flash. The silver spires of Silverymoon. Two dwarves walked the marble streets — Gundren and his grey-bearded father, who slapped a scroll pouch and proclaimed they would be the envy of the north. War-horns blared. From the walls they saw a horde of orcs, giants, and ogres — thousands, shaking the earth. The city's marble statues came alive, firing lances of golden fire. A blue shield began climbing around the city. Then a massive stone block crashed through the central citadel and the shield blinked out. Two ancient white dragons plummeted from the clouds, spraying icy death along the walls. Pa-Rockseeker grabbed his sapphire brooch and slapped it onto Gundren. The ice washed over them. When the fog cleared, Pa-Rockseeker crumbled into frozen chunks. Gundren, unhurt, looked on in horror.

## The Truth About Rahadin

The group found themselves back in the Amber Temple, breath puffing in great clouds, tears on many faces. Gundren turned to Gwen and whispered: *"Pa would be proud."* Patches busied herself in a corner. Tark, voice shaking, told the Nothics that a trade required payment from both sides.

Another flash — but the location remained the same. The temple, centuries ago, in better repair. All three amber crystals were intact. Rahadin stood before one, a red-eyed lich — Exethanter — floating behind him. Rahadin spoke of destroying the lich, who was only spared for his knowledge of the temple. He touched the crystal and his eyes went wide. A voice called from another part of the temple — *"We are leaving."* Rahadin called back that he would follow presently. Tark rushed to catch a glimpse of the speaker ascending the steps: Argynvost, the silver dragon, in human form. Brother of Rahadin. Rahadin was a silver dragon.

As Rahadin departed, Exethanter looked at the amber shard as if hearing a conversation, nodded, and shattered the crystal with a clench of his fist. Black mist poured from the broken amber and snaked out of the temple, after Rahadin.

## Dark Gifts

The vision faded. Tark's truesight caught the Arcanaloth — Nefron — turning a corner in the foyer and spotting him. They both froze, then dived back into cover. Kasimir swore and turned invisible. The group debated what to do.

Fëanon was drawn to the amber shards. He placed his hand on one and was offered a gift — a fragment of the dark entity within, in exchange for taking a piece of it into himself. He saw a dark well of infinite depth, its walls filled with millions of scrolls. He agreed — and immediately tried to force the entity into his ring of spell shielding. The shard fought hard, nearly gaining ground in his soul, before Fëanon expelled it with his remaining willpower. It filled the ring. He slumped with exhaustion but smiled — he could now call on the entity's scrying power.

An agonised scream echoed down the hall. Kasimir became visible, dark energy coursing over his body, and fell dead — killed by a Finger of Death spell. His corpse lurched up as a zombie and clawed at Tark. Gundren blew its head off with his thundercannon.

Tark took one side of the corridor to the foyer, Buumi the other. Patches climbed to the ceiling. Fëanon used his new scrying power to locate Exethanter — still floating around his dusty chambers. He lured the lich out and negotiated a temporary truce with the Arcanaloth. Exethanter was senile, barely coherent, drifting in and out of lucidity. Fëanon reached for the scroll of Greater Restoration — then saw the streak of grey in Tark's beard and hesitated. Cyrrus snatched the scroll from his hand and cast it on the lich.

Exethanter twitched, then stopped. He turned around with a massive rictus grin, rushed down to Cyrrus, and thanked him profusely for restoring his mind. Stick warned the group not to trust the lich. They didn't — but they accepted his offer of a tour.

## The Temple's Treasures

Exethanter stood down the defences and showed the group the treasure vault — amber doors melting away at a gesture, golden light flooding the foyer. Piles of gold, gems, and art littered a vast chamber. He offered a single item from the vault, or knowledge from the library, in exchange for accepting gifts from the dark powers imprisoned in the amber.

Cyrrus approached a crystal offered by the lich and saw a fiery titan rising from a world aflame. Remembering the Tooth Fairy and the terror of enslavement, he stumbled back, shaking his head. Exethanter offered consolation and a single item from the vault regardless. Cyrrus found it: a small crescent-moon blue-bladed sickle with a black glass hilt and moonstone pommel. His connection to his patron strengthened the moment he touched it.

Up in the library, Fëanon stood paralysed by indecision before thousands of spellbooks. He found one in Draconic and a magical writing desk materialised. He began transcribing two spells of staggering power: Wish and Power Word: Kill.

In the lowest chamber — six ornate coffins, three amber alcoves, a spiral stair — Tark approached the crystal that had granted Strahd his vampiric power. He saw himself standing in an endless plane of blood, forever young. He stepped back, thinking. Across the room, Patches placed her hand on another crystal and saw a dead planet suddenly reborn — with this power she could bring back those she had loved and lost. Buumi's hand fell on her shoulder. *"Whatever it's offering, it's not worth it."* She closed her eyes and turned away.

Buumi and Tark went upstairs to collect Fëanon and passed through Exethanter's chambers. In a corner, beneath a white silk shroud on a velvet pillow, they found a magnificent crystal blade — five feet long, no hilt, etched with intricate filigree, a hollow channel running its length. Both of them felt the goodness radiating from it, lifting their spirits for the first time since arriving in Barovia. They wrapped the blade carefully and Buumi secured it to his back.

## The Long Night

The group teleported to the frozen watchtower of Tsolenka Pass and raced down the mountainside in Van Richten's wagon, taking corners on two wheels. Near Vallaki, Buumi prayed over Patches and accidentally lifted the wrong curse — not the Reaver's, but a Geas that Rahadin had secretly placed on her during the battle, compelling her to kill Ireena with the soul-devouring blade when commanded. The pieces fell together: the dream's conspirators had spoken of killing Ireena and destroying her soul. Rahadin had ordered it. But after the Temple, they knew Rahadin was a silver dragon, brother of Argynvost — and something from the shattered amber had followed him out.

They crossed Lake Zarovich by rowboat in the dead of night. Halfway across, they passed a man fishing with a drowned girl as bait. Tark snapped his neck. Buumi revived him under a Zone of Truth — the man confessed to murder. Buumi held him underwater, relented when the group objected, and they left him in a sinking boat. Massive tentacles dragged him under moments later. The group rowed faster.

On the slopes of Mt. Baratok, they fought a Genoskwa — a ten-foot simian monstrosity that turned invisible, counterspelled their magic, and shrugged off gunfire. Only Cyrrus's hypnotic pattern brought it down long enough for the group to surround it, and Buumi's thrown hammer finished the creature. Exhausted, hurt, and running out of time before their appointment with Strahd, they pressed up the mountainside into the snow, led by Stick toward the Archmage of Oerth.
