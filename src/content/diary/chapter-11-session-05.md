The group moves out from the Longhouses, moving to the ancient mine cart tracks and the bridge over the water.

Before heading over the water to one of the small pyramids on an island, Buumi and Gundren move to check the last two buildings in the area.

One is a store room, with all the food supplies either smashed, ruined or spoiled.

In the back of this building is an ice-box, kept cool through rune magic.

Inside, Buumi and Gundren find several dead cultists, the rest of the group  heads over to investigate

Tark checks the last building - a large and simple looking structure of ancient stone.

He shadowsteps to a window and looks inside, immediately noting a makeshift barricade in one corner.

Behind the barricade, over a dozen cultists take shelter and notice Tark.

They rush from their defenses with a shout just as Buumi kicks down the door.

Tark and Buumi hold the door, keeping the cultists in the mess hall.

Feanon creates a wall of ice, blocking the back door to the mess hall just as two cultists slip from the structure but the rest are trapped within.

Cirrus moves forward and shuts the door to the mess hall, and a glowing line of magic illuminates the edge of the door.  Cirrus tells everyone not to open the door.

Around back, one of the cultists is killed and the other surrenders to Buumi. The last cultist reveals that his name is Rafiq.

Inside the mess hall, the cultists are a bit confused and open the front door of the mess hall, expecting to attack the group again.The door no longer opens to the same plane though and the cultists instead are greeted with a plain looking stone room with a statue of Cirrus at the center. They cautiously move into the room and the door shuts behind them…

Back in the real world, the group interrogates **Hazem** and **Rafiq** about the cults' operation here, but realize that both of these low level cultists don’t know a whole lot.

The group does get a good idea that life in Al Askar is pretty terrible, with a death cult providing a way to survive in a desolate world - made desolate by the ancient (now extinct) Saurians a thousand years ago.

This mine is an ancient outpost of the Saurians where they were mining spell-infusable crystals; something the cult is now continuing.

As the group presses on, they bind** Rafiq** and move to the small pyramid out on the island. Upon entering the smaller pyramid, the chamber is empty except for a small teleporter that takes the group to an otherwise inaccessible room. The room below, used as a private room for one of the high ranking cultists, is quickly ransacked by the heroes.

The group finds an ancient statue of a Saurian bust with one of the crests embedded in it’s chest.  A cryptex sits in front of it with three dials covered in hieroglyphs.

They try some of the combinations found on notes which results in the Saurian statue breathing flame across the room.

This happens a few more times as the group tries other combinations without luck.

The group takes another look around the room and this time finds a glowing crystal containing an ancient soul. A phylactery of a long dead Saurian engineer named **Hasrala**

The long dead Saurian talks with the group and, after they offer to assist in maybe finding him another body, Hasrala gives over the combination key. They also discover that the Saurians were fighting the Phaerimm but found their enemy even in Faerun.

The group puts in the combination and the crest is released  - the first crest the group needs for the main control panel back in the large, main pyramid.

The group moves on, continuing across the water of the cavern lake and to the next small pyramid. They enter the structure and are greeted with an infestation of black webbing and egg sacs. The group destroys the corruption by burning the egg sacs, but the act awoke some of the creatures and a few bursts from their eggs to attack the group.

The small creatures spew forth acid when struck and prove to be quite vicious

Feanon collects one of the more intact corpses to study and the group takes the teleporter in this pyramid to the associated private chamber.

Once again they are greeted with a statue bust, though this one is of a feline Tabaxi.

They try the combinations they have collected - resulting in a spray of poison from the statue. They succeed in retrieving the crest after a second attempt. The Tabaxi statue releases the second icon and the group moves on.

They leave the second pyramid, spotting the third in the darkness further into the lake-filled cavern. They head across the ancient tracks and bridges, unmolested and arrive at the final island and pyramid. 

Just as Buumi decides to head to the back of the line and check on Rafiq, the man is taken.

A blur of movement and a scream and Rafiq is nowhere to be found…

The group forms up, intent on finally spying on this strange creature that has been attacking, but it does not show itself again, seemingly content with its meal…

With no enemy to face, the group turns to the pyramid and heads inside.

This final pyramid has a few shrouded human-sized cocoons, wrapped in iridescent purple and green silk webs, that currently inhabit this room. Some of the cocoons appeared to be ripped open from within. 

The group burns it away, not getting close enough for the spores to be an issue.

They take the final teleporter to the associated room and find a bust of an Arakocra.

With the final combination, the group gets the last of the crests and returns back to the small pyramid.

Now, with all of the crests, the group can return to the large pyramid and the control console and finally descend into the deepest section of the mine and find the mural of The Last Word.
