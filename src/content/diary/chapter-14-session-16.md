Feanon has things to do in his Tower, things that cannot wait.

He arrives at his tower easily via magical means and ascends to the higher levels

The wizard sees Maya doing menial tasks in the lab and decides that there’s no time like the present to vet her and takes the time to interview her

She has an impressive resume, but never spent more than 5 years at any given position, which for even a young elf is a red flag

Her academic knowledge seems promising and he always needs more students (and tuition) so Feanon accepts her for now

As he leaves the lab, he realizes he has a message on the Crystal Data Slate taken from Al’Askar and the Machina Factory

In perfect Faerunian Common it says “This planet is wonderful…”

The last time he spoke with someone on this Tablet, it was one of Vecna’s most powerful mages, The Lady in White.

As far as he knows though, they killed her…

A mystery for later and Feanon continues to the conservatory and finds Theodemir waiting for him

The old Archmage requests a replacement body and not just a clone of Feanon and inquires about getting a True Polymorph or True Resurrection from the powerful group

Feanon scoffs at the idea that anyone would give up a superior body, but admits that getting the clone back would be great and/or getting Theodemir back to full strength would be great for the Tower.

He then looks in on Mordy, Megno, Beryan and the apprentices engaged in research but decides to leave them be, before scrying on the rest of the group in Luskan

He sees them engaged in furious battle in a dark alley, beset by Drow

The wizard leaps to his feet, and rushes into town to grab Tark…


Hours earlier, Tark went into the forest to quiet his mind and focus on his inner peace

He is heading East to vanquish the great villain in his life

He focuses on the stump in front of him before smashing it apart in a flurry of blows too fast to follow

He then turns and leaps at a boulder with his prosthesis glowing red and strikes it, launching the great stone twenty feet to crash through the forest…

With the sun long set, Tark then heads to the center of town to meet his friends, ready to leave.

He finds Buumi waiting there, packed and ready but no one else.

Buumi mentions that everyone else took a day trip to Luskan to find out who attacked her, but the Paladin stayed behind specifically to begin this trip with Tark and the others would catch up

Feanon speeds into the center of town atop his Spectral Steed and proclaims that the others may need their help - they are under attack

Feanon then teleports the three of them to the dark alley he saw in his vision


Meanwhile in the Alley, Patches hog ties the surviving Drow and stuff him into her bag of holding.

Gundren quickly ransacks the corpses and finds the Drow equipped with excellent gear and all bearing insignias of house Faen Tlabbar: Patches old house

Hearing commotion abound as the ruffians of the city react to the short but intense battle, the group decides to head back into One Eyed Jacks before anyone gets too curious

As they turn to enter the establishment, they find their way barred by a familiar human man

Barrabus the Grey 

An associate of Jarlaxle and one they had last seen in Menzoberranzan before the showdown of the Demon Lords and the Slave Market

He remarks that the fight was a good one, but that the other “Ships” are going to take an interest in the powerful group

He knows they are looking for **Morik the Rogue** and can lead the group through the streets to the docks where he has a boat ready to take them to Morik’s Ship; *The Moniker*

Gundren watches from above in the quiet sky but quickly realizes that he is not alone up here

He rockietalkies down that he thinks they should move and the group agrees

Barrabus makes a hand gesture to Patches in Thieves Cant and then scales the nearby building almost as quickly as Patches would and vanishes into the darkness.

Even Patches is impressed

Patches leads the group into the dark alleyways of Luskan following Jarlaxle’s agent

Every so often Patches stops, finding a sigil in Thieves Cant giving the next route and she leads them on

Gundren spots several well armed groups shadowing the party though he cannot tell if they are hostile and following directly or reacting to messages

He doesnt take the chance and does some fly-overs out of their sight, dropping grease down the alleyways from above

The groups panic and lose their balance, many falling flat and all shouting in dismay

Gundren reports to the group and they pick up the pace

They make it to the docks quickly and avoid the rest of the populace

They duck under a nearby wharf and due to the Low Tide, find a decent amount of very sheltered and very stinky space

Muscles and Barnacles gleam in the moonlight and crabs and other *things *skitter up and down the muck of the harbor

On the edge of the water and still under the wharf, is a rowboat big enough for a dozen people 

The oars are manned by Drow and Barrabus awaits by the prow

The group *know *that something is up, this is likely a trap or a double cross

They take the time to question the Drow that Patches has in her bag

He refuses all interrogation, even willing to die to Feanon’s Torture spell rather than speak

He taunts Patches, saying that her mother will flay her and turn her skin into an apostate tapestry to warn others of betraying Lolth

Patches summons Eclipse and then proclaims the name of her new housed, summoning the power of Elistraee

The Drow Warrior cowers and goes silent

He is re-tied and thrown back into Patches bag of holding

The group sees no other option than to take the boat with Barrabus to Morik and they get on board and are rowed out into the Harbor

They quietly glide across the dark waters of the late-night harbor, the revelry of the city providing ample cover as they approach a very large three masted vessel with an oversized rear quarters

A beautiful set of stained glass windows glitter on the balcony of the huge captain’s quarters

Barrabus scales the ship easily, as does Patches and they lower a rope ladder to the rowboat

Cirrus simply levitates up as do most of the others in their own fashion

Buumi climbs the Ladder

Barrabus gestures to the Stained glass windows and a door set in them

The group enters

Inside they find a lavish set of quarters with a huge dining table set out before them, covered in a feast

the tablecloth hangs to the floor

At one end of the chamber is a beautiful four post bed and reading nook

At the other is a throne and an ancient looking human man lounging in it

Wispy white hair, pale thin skin and liver spots are in contrast to the beautiful and ornate garb

The man leans heavily on a cane and pushes himself to his feet, smiling and gestures to the feast

He welcomes the Faerun Defense Force and offers them food at his table while they discuss business

Feanon looks around the room, feeling uneasy about the dimensions of the space.  It feels smaller than it should…

The group does not relax and approach the food, instead standing resolute

Patches demands to know who put the price on her head

A flowery laugh erupts nearby and a familiar voice calls “Why, I did my dear!”

The walls of the room vanish, revealing another five feet of space around the front and sides, harboring over a dozen figures

Morik grimaces and slumps back into his chair, watching the drama that no longer concerns him

Jarlaxle stands in the middle of over a dozen Drow Warriors, crossbows trained on the group

Jarlaxle, stands there smiling, wand in hand and pointed at the group

He is flanked by two other Drow that immediately stand out to the group

One is clearly a Wizard, holding an adamantine staff tipped in a crystal spider, wearing black robes so dark they absorb light and hurt to look at

his whole body shines like metal and gleams with wards as his outline blurs and shifts with the forms of Mirror Images

The other Drow is a short female arrayed in full Adamantine Plate armor, covered in intricate web filigree and spider motifs worked into the metal

She wears no helm and her silver hair cascades down her neck in long braids

He head is seemingly backlit by a dark halo and her eyes blaze with purple fire as she strides forward and points at Patches with the writhing coils of her snake-headed whip

“I, Ishta of House Faen Tlabbar will see you dead Apostate! Die Sister!”

A silence spell then renders the room eerily silent

Patches immediately dives under the nearby table, intent on affixing a bomb to the table and blowing the ship up only to find that the table is in fact just a wooden board atop several large barrels.

6 Large barrels of Smokepowder and one has a glowing ruby embedded in the side

She dives out from the table and rushes for the back window, putting as much space between herself and the massive bomb under the table as she can and signals to her group to retreat post-haste

She dives out of the window just in time to spot Morik pull out a small ruby and mouth “I fucking hate Drow” and then locks eyes with Jarlaxle

He winks at her

The entire ship bursts into motion as the Drow loose their crossbow bolts and the group rushes for the balcony to retreat as Ishta raises her Scourge to strike

A flurry of Counterspells renders the first barrage of spells ineffective but JmJm dives backwards out of the Stained Glass and releases the charges on his rings, sending a Lightning Bolt blasting into the front ranks of the Drow and lands on Arkto

Gundren had been watching and waiting outside

Morik presses down on the ruby about to crush it but Cirrus beats him to the punch, leaping out from the balcony and launching a fireball back into the cabin

The smokepowder detonates, destroying the entire back half of the ship in a massive explosion which then chains off the stores of the ship

The entire vessel is blown to splinters and the group is thrown into the harbor

They pull themselves from the drink and decide that they have outstayed their welcome in Luskan

Cirrus opens a door in the harbor wall and they all step through into his Demiplane

Everyone is furious at Jarlaxle, he betrayed them!

Patches shrugs, far calmer than everyone else and explains that she doesn't think so

Jarlaxle is a businessman and operates from Menzoberranzan.  He is at the “mercy” of the hierarchy of the city and likely had to take the job from Faen Tlabbar

This explosion, Morik having the detonator and the wink from Jarlaxle makes her think it was all part of a larger scheme

Either way, her enemies may think her dead for the time being, or at the very least have a very hard time following now

Safe in the Demiplane, they spend the night and rest

The next morning Cirrus Planeshifts the group back to the Material Plane, directly to The Bloodstone Lands and on the outlying farms around the City of Helioglabulus (Helios for short)

Tark looks upon his homeland for the first time in almost 7 years from the top of the gently sloping hills of the Damaran Steppe

The capital city sprawls before them, some ten miles away across flat grasslands spotted with the occasional tree

The city itself appears to be a set of concentric city walls of dark stone threaded through with gleaming scarlet red mineral

The center of the city is dominated by a classic Eastern Orthodox castle of the glittering ore, the turrets capped by teardrop swirls of colorful architecture

Another great building dominates a section of the city - a domed structure with many steeples and points raising in a great array - the Cathedral of Lathander

The nearby land is a patchwork of farms as far as they eye can see and butts up to the sprawl of the city not contained behind the Bloodstone walls

The fields bustle with the activity of agriculture and the roadways show numerous carts and wagons moving across the landscape

To the north, then wrapping down to the west and continuing south out of sight, a vast snow capped mountain range dominates the view

The group heads to a nearby road, extricating themselves from a field of green wheat not yet ready for harvest

They decide to get the lay of the land and some local news before deciding their next move so they move to one of the nearby farms

The group is greeted by the local farm hands and Tark helps them work for a few hours

He learns that much has changed since he has been gone

The Warlock Knights of Vaasa that sacked Bloodstone City in the north long ago have made peace with Damara

They have allied and merged with the Paladins of Lathander to found The Order of the Crimson Dawn

King Yarin Frostmantle of Damara and Queen Concetinna of Vaasa have ruled since their coronation five years ago. Things are prosperous.

They command the new Knightly Order and rule “For The Greater Good” of all the people of the Bloodstone lands. They wield the law evenly without compromise.

Rumblings of War darken recent days with Impultur and Thay going off to war in the West, people are worried they will be dragged into it

The Red Wizards of Thay have an embassy in Helios and are engaging in trade with the kingdom. A large contingent of them are in the city now.

The group settles in for lunch with the farmers and they begin to discuss what to do next.

Tark feels cold as a subtle heartbeat scratches the back of his mind; Li Xian’s dagger, the dagger that killed his family thrums in the Bag of Holding, pulling Tark North.
