Awaking the next day, the group goes about helping aboard the ship when possible and generally recovering.  JmJm picks up the new sword from the captain and puts it through some practice swings, seeing it's magic and being thoroughly impressed.  As the ship limps back into harbor, the group sees the city is in quite a dour mood.  They hear from the captain that the undead mists have made it to Baldurs gate and in fact, from every land they have word from, the dead rise.  People are beginning to speak of it as the end times, or another time of troubles.

The group disembarks and parts ways with Lo'Dan, who goes to report to his superiors.  Patches mentions that if they ever need help again, they should just ask, if they are tricked again, it won't end well for Lo'Dan…

Heading through the docks, the group stops two guards to ask for directions and are pointed to the Merry Maidens arms (a place Lo'Dan recommended).  Patches sends one of the soldiers off with a letter for Lady Faye before hurrying along to the Tavern.

On their way, the group notices a great many mercenaries augmenting the city guard and as night falls, the streets seem to clear of all civilians.

Entering the tavern, JmJm barges in, with many of his Goblins out and wrapped up in Burlap.  Panicking at the sight of numerous oddly proportioned and strangely clothed small creatures, the tavern is relieved to find out they are just Goblin Slaves (a couple dwarves in the corner still think it's worth killing a few…) As Patches attempts to diffuse the situation with a fake arrest, the confusion allows the Goblins and JmJm to retreat into the box.  Everything begins to calm down as the patrons realize that no undead just waltzed in.

Drinks are poured and Gundren sits in a corner, with the clockwork lion walking up and clawing deep gouges into the wooden floor, which annoys the barkeep.  It almost escalates to blows again as Gundren threatens the barkeep.  Many patrons grasp for weapons before Gundren gives way, giving the barkeep the gold for the floor repairs.

Across the tavern, a swashbuckler is entertaining with a story which fascinates Tark.  Tark immediately hijacks the story however, one upping everything the swashbuckler was saying. He recounts to tale of the group up to this point.  JmJm reappears, assisting the retelling of the story with his bardic powers.  Many of the onlookers are wrapped up in the story, as it sheds some light on the present situation.  Some city guards slip out during the tale, taking news of the group to their superiors.

As the night wears on, the group rents out the penthouse suite and retire for the night.  In the room, Fey'Anon opens the main window, looking into the street.  The evil fog is beginning to appear and the city is unnaturally quiet.  On a hunch, the group takes the artifact and holds it into the fog.  Immediately, the fog is driven back by the artifact.  Thinking this may be handy, the group works the artifact into Buumi's shield.  Everyone except for patches heads into the box, Patches staying out in the shadows to take her Reverie.  A few hours go by and she's "awoken" by a dark presence.   She sees an ethereal skeletal form in the diffused moonlight for a split second, the dark fog having entered the abode through the still open window.

Patches hurries into the box and lets the group know something is wrong.  The group exits the box, unable to wake up Buumi, but JmJm animates his armor to bring him along anyway.

The group finds the room deserted and decide to stealthily check the hallway.  The fog is throughout the tavern and everything is quiet.  Going down the hallway, the group sees a single cracked door and can see a boot on the other side.

Opening the door just a little more, the group notices two wraiths floating in the rafters, waiting to descend on someone.  The boot belongs to a desiccated corpse.

Fey'Anon robs the wraiths of their sneak attack by causing magical light to swell in the room and with a shriek, the group ambushes the would be attackers.  As the battle with the wraiths begins however, several zombies, spirits and two more wraiths come out of other rooms along the hallway.  The group finds that the chill touch of the wraiths saps their very life essence and those touched feel considerably weaker and cannot seem to get warm.

Dispatching the undead, the group manages to defeat the wraiths.  They close the window in their room and note that seven other people were killed on this floor.  They loot some gold and gemstones from the bodies and head downstairs to the common room of the Tavern where a number of people are sleeping - somehow not being woken by the combat above.  The patrons begin to wake as the fog clears and ask what happened.  The group recounts the attack - not telling the tavern owner it was them who accidentally left the window open.

With dawn only a few hours away, the Tavern owner implores the group to rest and wait for the city guard to arrive…incidents like these are becoming more and more widespread…
