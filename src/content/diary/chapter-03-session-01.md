The group spent the next day helping aboard the damaged ship as it limped back toward port. JmJm took the captain's enchanted cutlass — Smoke — and put it through its paces on deck, watching the blade trail ash with each swing. As the ship pulled into Baldur's Gate, the group saw a city gripped by fear. The captain explained that the undead mists had reached the city, and from every land they had word from, the dead were rising. People were beginning to speak of it as the end times — or another Time of Troubles.

## The Merry Maidens Arms

The group disembarked and parted ways with Lo'Dan, who left to report to his superiors. Patches told him that if they ever needed help again, they should just ask — but if the group was tricked again, it wouldn't end well for him.

Heading through the docks, the group asked guards for directions and was pointed to the Merry Maidens Arms, a tavern Lo'Dan had recommended. Patches sent one of the soldiers off with a sealed letter for Lady Faye before hurrying along. They noticed a great many mercenaries augmenting the city guard, and as night fell, the streets emptied of civilians entirely.

JmJm barged into the tavern with several of his astral goblins out and wrapped in burlap. The sight of numerous oddly proportioned, strangely clothed small creatures sent the room into a panic — patrons grabbed for weapons, a couple of dwarves in the corner debated whether it was worth killing a few. Patches diffused the situation with a quick fake arrest, the confusion allowing JmJm and the goblins to retreat into the Tavern of Doors. Everything calmed once the patrons realized no undead had just walked in.

Gundren settled into a corner, his clockwork lion Guinevere gouging deep scratches into the wooden floor — which nearly started another fight with the barkeep until Gundren paid for the repairs. Across the room, a swashbuckler was entertaining with a tale that fascinated Tark. Tark immediately hijacked the story, one-upping everything the swashbuckler claimed and recounting the group's exploits from the beginning. JmJm reappeared to assist the retelling with his bardic powers, and soon the onlookers were wrapped up in the tale. Several city guards slipped out during the performance, taking word of the group to their superiors.

## The Artifact and the Fog

As the night wore on, the group rented the penthouse suite. Fëanon opened the window and looked out over the city — the necromantic fog was creeping through the streets, and the city was unnaturally quiet. On a hunch, the group held the artifact out into the fog. Immediately, the mist was driven back. Seeing its potential, they worked the artifact into Buumi's shield.

Everyone except Patches headed into the Tavern of Doors for the night. Patches stayed in the shadows to take her Reverie. A few hours later, she was roused by a dark presence — a skeletal, ethereal form visible for a split second in the diffused moonlight, the fog having entered through the still-open window.

## Wraiths in the Night

Patches hurried into the Tavern of Doors and warned the group. They emerged to find the room deserted and the hallway filled with fog. Scouting ahead, they found a cracked door — a desiccated corpse beyond it, and two wraiths floating in the rafters, waiting to descend on the next victim.

Fëanon robbed the wraiths of their ambush by flooding the room with magical light. As the group engaged, more undead poured from rooms along the hallway — zombies, spirits, and two additional wraiths. The chill touch of the wraiths sapped life essence itself, leaving those struck feeling weak and unable to get warm.

The group dispatched the undead. Seven others on the floor had not been so fortunate. They closed the window — neglecting to mention to the tavern owner that they were the ones who had left it open — and headed downstairs, where the patrons were only just waking to learn what had happened above them.

The tavern owner implored the group to rest and wait for the city guard. Incidents like these, he said, were becoming more and more widespread.
