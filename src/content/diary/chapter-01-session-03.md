Lothli trekked out to Thundertree alone, bringing the wolves the party had tamed in the goblin hideout. The journey was largely uneventful — she avoided a Hobgoblin patrol along the way — though an unsettling mist rolled in during the night, putting everyone on edge.

## Return to Thundertree

The next day, approaching Thundertree, Lothli came across several dead dragon cultists and looted two diamonds worth 200 gold each. The town itself was devastated — buildings flattened, the entire settlement torn apart. A furious young green dragon could be seen in the distance, still throwing a tantrum. The wolves tracked a scent to Reidoth's old house, now nothing more than rubble.

Lothli found the Tavern of Doors half-buried under fallen timber. She rigged a rope to the wolves and began working to shift the beam.

Inside the box, the party had been recuperating. Tark was being tended to by the goblins and healed by Doctor Breakfast, while Buumi sat sullen in the corner — still shaken over having let Tark nearly die. The group had been woken in the night by subtle shaking, and when morning came, the door wouldn't budge. With Lothli pulling from the outside and the crew pushing from within, the lid finally gave way and the group sprang forth.

## Departure from Thundertree

Reunited, the party caught Lothli up on events. In the distance, Venomfang was still circling and raging, occasionally bellowing about "thieves." Reidoth appeared as a squirrel and led them back to the wagon, where one of the oxen had been mauled — the other had hidden and survived. Shifting back into human form, the druid berated the group for provoking the dragon but relented and told them the location of Cragmaw Castle. He departed without ceremony.

The party set out through Neverwinter Wood, leaving Venomfang and the ruins of Thundertree behind. Lothli guided them through the forest. The first day was uneventful, but as night fell and the group pressed on, another bout of the eerie mist crept in.

## Zombie Wolves

The mist brought zombie wolves. Patches obliterated one with a sniper shot from the side of the cart. Another fell to a volley of longbow arrows, a third was decapitated by Buumi, and the last was destroyed by Doctor Breakfast's fire blade. The group decided to rest for the night, piling into the Tavern of Doors with the surviving ox. Patches climbed a tree with the box before hopping inside.

Over tea — courtesy of Patches — Buumi noticed that JmJm's harp bore the symbols of Sharess, and the group pieced together that the minor goddess had gifted them both the Tavern of Doors and the magical harp. They examined the flask from the dragon's hoard and, after much tinkering, determined it could produce any liquid in infinite quantity, though harder substances poured more slowly.

The goblins brought out a feast, and the party investigated to discover a goblin-sized door leading to a full kitchen with a stocked pantry and bunks. The next morning, stables had begun growing in the entryway — apparently the Tavern adapting to the presence of the ox.

## Infiltrating Cragmaw Castle

Within two miles of Cragmaw Castle, Lothli and Patches scouted ahead. The castle was a crumbling ruin — somewhat reminiscent of Dol Guldur — with goblin archers covering the main entrance, though they were distracted shooting at a lone zombie milling about in the courtyard.

The scouts returned with their report and the entire party crept in through the front entrance, despite Fëanon squelching noisily through the mud. Turning right, they found a sleeping goblin archer in a nook. They captured him silently and threw him tied up into the box.

Through the keyhole of the next door they spotted two goblins. Patches and Lothli opened the door and killed both instantly with sneak attacks. The group took a short rest in the small room while Patches made tea. JmJm, unnoticed, slipped away to scout ahead on his own.

## JmJm and the Cook

JmJm stumbled into a large eating hall occupied by seven goblins and a massive cook goblin — Yorg — who was stirring a mystery-meat stew, covered in blood and gore. JmJm attempted to charm the room. Four goblins fell under his sway, three and the cook did not.

The charmed goblins turned on their fellows with savage enthusiasm — three of them immediately ganking a nearby goblin, tearing it limb from limb. The fourth, standing next to the cook, stuck Yorg with a knife before being grabbed and thrown headfirst into the bubbling pot. One of the remaining hostile goblins was shot dead by the party's archers, who had followed JmJm at a distance. The last surviving hostile goblin dove out a window and fled into the night.

Yorg charged JmJm and cracked him with a mace, but Fëanon stepped from the shadows and stunned the cook with a charm. They tied Yorg up and knocked him unconscious. Patches slit the throat of one of the charmed goblins as the spell wore off — making a point — but Buumi, feeling bad for it, healed the goblin with a lay on hands. The five surviving goblins were stuffed into the Tavern's growing stables. They found 150 gold on Yorg's person.

## Rescuing Gundren

Continuing through the fortress, the group reached a set of large ornate doors. Patches drilled out the lock and peered through — a Drow female was in the process of buying Gundren Rockseeker from a boss bugbear.

Rather than burst in, the party held back and allowed the transaction to complete, following the Drow — Tarla — as she left the castle with her prisoner. Just as she threw Gundren onto her horse, Doctor Breakfast spooked the animal and the group put Tarla to sleep with magic.

They captured the Drow and recovered Gundren, retreating to the treeline before entering the Tavern of Doors. Patches took Tarla into the bathroom for a private interrogation. Convincing the Drow she was ready to kill her, Patches got Tarla to reveal the location of Wave Echo Cave.

## The Doppelganger

Patches stepped out of the bathroom to relay the information. In that moment, Tarla — actually a Doppelganger — shapeshifted out of her bonds and made a break for the exit. She made it up the stairs before Fëanon stopped her with a hold spell, but only briefly.

The group gave chase, desperate to prevent her from warning the Black Spider. Shot and whipped back toward the box as she scrambled for freedom, Tarla eventually realized escape was impossible and turned to fight. She landed a critical hit on Buumi that took half his life, throwing him down the stairs, then struck Patches for half her health before the group finally brought her down.

Her body deflated, leaving behind an empty skin. JmJm picked it up and wore it as a scarf.

The group returned to the wagon with Gundren in tow and retired into the Tavern of Doors to rest and debrief.
