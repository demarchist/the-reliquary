- next day, Lothli approaches thundertree, comes across some dead dragon cultists, loots two 200gp diamonds.

- heads into town, finds destruction, entire place is torn up and leveled, wolves track scent to Reidoths old house, now flattened. Pissed off young green dragon in the distance had a tantrum

- Lothli finds the ToD with a timber fallen across it, attempts to move the timber with rope and wolf help

- meanwhile, inside the box, Tark is being tended to by the Goblins and gets healed by the druid, Buumi is sullen in the corner for failing Tark and letting him almost die.

- group recouperates and heals up in box

- woken up in the night by a subtle shaking

- wake up in morning, try the door but it wont budge, try harder // Lothli is removing the timber, and with the assistance of the crew inside, opens the lid and the group springs forth

- re-uniting with Lothli, the group tells what happened and notices a very pissed off Venomfang in the distance still routing around yelling the occasional thing about "Thieves"

- Reidoth as a Squirrel shows up and they leave with him back to the wagon, where one of the Oxen got mauled and the other hid.

- Reidoth shapeshifts back into human, berates the group for pissing off the dragon, but tells the group where Cragmaw castle is.  He leaves.

- Group now heads to Cragmaw through neverwinter wood, leaving Venomfang and Thundertree behind.

- Uneventful day traveling through the forest, Lothli helps steer the group through the forest.

-  Night falls and the group decides to keep going, but another bout of the creepy mist rolls in.

- attacked by Zombie wolves, One is obliterated by Patches, sneakily sniping from the side of the cart, another is shot by longbow arrows, another decapitated by buumi, the last killed by fire sword of druid.

-decide to rest for the night, all pile in ToD, bring last Oxen in, then patches climbs tree with box before hopping in.

- rest for the night, Patches makes tea, Buumi mentions that JmJm's harp has symbols of Sharess on it, the group puts together that the minor goddess gifted ToD and the harp.

- Group looks at the loot from the Dragon, start to experiement with the flask.  After much tinkering, they determine it can produce any liquid in an infinite amount

but varying speeds of pouring, harder liquids comes out slower.

- Goblins bring out feast from somewhere, group investigates to find a goblin sized door that leads to a full kitchen with stocked pantry and bunks for the Goblins.

- next morning, Stables have begun to grow in the entry way after bringing the Oxen inside.

- Get within two miles of Cragmaw castle, Lothli and Patches go on to scout ahead.

- come across cragmaw castle (looks a bit like Dol Guldur) notice Goblin archers covering the main entry but are distracted shooting at a random Zombie milling about.

- return to group and all sneak in through the front entrance despite Fey'Anon squelching noisily through the mud.

- take right in castle, find sleeping Goblin archer in archer nook, capture him silently and throw him tied up into the box.

- peek through keyhole of next door, see two goblins, open door and insta kill both with sneak attacks from Patches and Lothli

- take a short break in this small room, Patches makes tea, JmJm decides to sneak on ahead, the rest of the group not really noticing until he has already left.

- JmJm comes across a large eating hall, with seven Goblins and a big fat cook Goblin cooking a mystery meat stew, covered in red blood and gore.

- JmJm attempts to charm the group, getting four goblins on his side, three enemies and the cook against him

- three of the four closest immediately gank their buddy, tearing him limb from limb, the one charmed next to the cook sticks him with the knife before being thrown head first into the pot by the cook

- last two normal goblins charge, one immediately gets shot by the archers of the group and dies, the last surviving normal Goblin escapes out the window and runs for it.

- The cook; Yorg, charges JmJm and smacks him with his mace, damaging him, before Fey'Anon steps out of the shadows and stun/charms Yorg.

- They immediately tie him up and knock him unconscious.  Patches slits the throat of one of the Goblins as their charm wears off to put them in line, but Buumi, feeling bad for it, heals it with his lay on hands.

- They throw the five Goblins in the box in the newly growing stables, it's a tight fit. they find 150g on Yorg

- continuing on, they sneak through the fortress until they come to a large set of ornate doors.

- drilling the lock out, Patches looks through and sees a Drow female (Tarla) buying Gundren Rockseeker from a boss Bugbear.

- Instead of leaping into the room, they back off, allowing the Drow to leave with her prisoner, taking Gundren with her.

- They follow Tarla out of the castle and right as she throws gundren onto her horse, Dr.B scares the horse away and they put Tarla to sleep with magic.

- Capturing Tarla and recovering Gundren, they head to the treeline and then enter ToD.

- They throw Tarla into the bathroom of the ToD where Patches wakes her up and interrogates her alone.  Persuading Tarla she's ready to kill her, patches gets her to spill her guts.

- Tarla tells Patches the location of Wave Echo Cave.  Leaving the bathroom to tell the group, Tarla, actually a Doppleganger shapeshifts out of her bonds and prepares to escape.

- Opening the door to re-enter and continue interrogating Tarla, the Doppleganger springs forth, surprising the group and making a break for the exit, she makes it up the steps before Fey'anon stops her with a hold spell, temporarily.

- giving chase, the group does everything it can to kill her to stop her warning The Black Spider

- shot, and then whipped-dragged back towards the box as she tries to escape, eventually Tarla decides escape is not an option and turns to fight.

- sprinting back she crits Buumi for half his life, throwing him down the stairs and then whacks Patches for half her life before the Doppleganger is finally killed.

- her body deflating and leaving it's skin, JmJm picks it up and wears it as a scarf/cape

- The group returns to the wagon with Gundren in tow and retires into the box to rest up and interrogate Gundren.
