The group finds themselves in a precarious situation with powerful enemies arrayed before them.

The battlefield explodes into action as the Boneclaws rush forwards to engage first with the undead Saurian Lord in rapid pursuit.

The group takes defensive measures and a small stormcloud appears in the center of the arena from Thorna and a holy nimbus begins to glow from Buumi

Tark engages the Death Lord, striking through two of his three illusionary duplicates in quick succession.

The Lord retaliates with a long, curving blade. The ancient and gratuitously bejeweled sword striking in rapid succession and cutting at Tark.

The sword leaves a trail of dark crackling energies that burn Tark.

The Lord then slips away, turning to shadow and walking to Feanon.

In common, the Death Lord tells Feanon to abandon his friends and join Vecna.  This is his only chance.

The Lord then slips into shadows again and reappears back in close quarters with Tark…

Feanon gives the offer nary a thought, and responds with a powerful spell. The wizard notes though, that the Death Lord has two spells active, a Mirror Image and Haste.

With the teleport of the Saurian Lord and the Boneclaws into the temple moments ago came a host of other Undead.

On the outer ring of the temple, over two dozen skeletons and a couple of Banshees move in to flank and surround the group.

A nearby Boneclaw gets Jmjm’s attention and the bard moves in, slashing with his weapons.

The creature is moved to the very edge of the lava and almost tumbles in, but then teleports in a burst of shadow and necrotic energies, burning the bard.

The Boneclaw reappears in the middle of the temple to assist its lord.

One of the Banshees floats over near JmJm and lets loose a terrifying shriek

JmJm drops to the ground, instantly unconscious.

JmJm does not stay down for long and is back on his feet from a healing spell and quickly gets several more cast his way by his friends, including a regeneration from Thorna.

Buumi calls out to his friends, he reminds them that the Boneclaws are deadliest in Darkness and though his Holy Nimbus is powerful, it cannot cover enough of the temple with light!

 Buumi then enacts an Aura of Life to counter the necrotic energies being employed by the Death Lord and his minions.

 JmJm, Gundren, and Thorna are all outside the temple to deal with the Flanking undead.

Gundren sees the situation and decides its time to bring out the big guns, literally.  He pulls out the Thundercannon, Summons Arkto and calls out to Patches “Let the Cat outta the Bag!”

In the temple, Patches hears the order, and reaches for her bag of holding, opening it and releasing Gwenwhyvar from her confinement.

As gundren flies up into the air on Arkto, he pulls a glowing Opal from his helm of Brilliance and tosses the Daylight gem into the temple, illuminating the inside with another source of bright light to foul the Boneclaws teleport.

The Mechanical Lion lands near Tark and immediately charges up a blast of lightning, destroying a swath of skeletons moving in on Cirrus.

As the skeletons fall though, the Death Lord raises a gauntleted hand and a purple glowing Sourcestone erupts with light.  The nearby skeletons re-knit together and come back to life.

The Lord then moves through the battlefield, striking at the group with his wicked sword.

The melee of the group manages to convene in the center of the temple, despite the confusion.

Snorbul, Patches, Buumi and Tark all engage the Boneclaws and Death Lord in close combat, turning the center of the temple into a chaotic melee

As magic begins to be unleashed in increasing quantities, the unstable world reacts badly.  With the barriers between worlds already being thin, a rift opens and two massive, metal spiders walk through rifts from the Shadowfell.

The massive spiders are huge and dangerous looking and Cirrus and Thorna have no desire to tangle with them.

Each unleashes a powerful Banishment, keeping each spider at bay for now…

Jareem, in his Genasi form, steps forward and calls up a wall of fire, separating the group from the flanking Undead and then rushes forward, intent on joining the battle.

The melee is fierce, but with the shining light prohibiting the Boneclaws from teleporting, the group manages to overwhelm and destroy two of the undead things.

The Death Lord and two others though retaliate and wound the group considerably, forcing a great deal of healing.

As more energies cascade for from the group, another rift is torn open, this time with a flash of vermillion light.

Three massive forms step from the rift, between the group and the horde of undead that they face.

Three massive lizard-like creatures, with oversized jaws and undersized arms stride forwards on thick legs, serpentine tails waving.

The air ruffles their feathers and the lavla-light glints off red crystalline protrusions.

The Fae-touched Tyrannosaurus Rex’s fixate on the nearby undead and their massive snapping jaws descend on the nearby Boneclaws…
