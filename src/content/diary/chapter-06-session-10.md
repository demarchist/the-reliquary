## Farewell to the Dragon

The group lingered at the hot springs. Vaelstraza seemed particularly interested in Tark and his draconic connections, though she curled her lip when he mentioned Bahamut. Tark pressed for a sparring match, but the dragon kept insisting it would be beneath her — though everyone knew the real reason she declined. Cyrrus swam in the spring and then sat at the edge, staring up at the moon, his chrome eyes reflecting starlight. Patches had Mr. Pickles brew tea from the hot spring water. Buumi sat with Aurora, writing one-handed in his journal.

Fëanon spent the evening feeling the magic of the area and concluded it was a mana spring — a Ley-Line attuned to druidic energies. The group fell into a deep and magically restful sleep. While meditating on the moon, Cyrrus received visions once more of the four warlocks of Cerregorach he must find: a halfling in Neverwinter, a Derro in Gracksuluth, a Red Wizard in Thay and a samurai in Kara-Tur.

Patches woke in the night to something knocking snow from nearby branches. She investigated and found a small tree-dwelling creature — white-furred with bristly ice-like quills, a blue belly and a large fluffy tail. The ice squirrel bounded from tree to tree and went about its business.

Come morning, the group awoke to find Vaelstraza had shifted into the form of a small red-headed halfling girl and was studying Tark intently. They advised her that the shape would serve her far better among the dwarves of Gauntlgrym than her true form. She thanked them for the company and remarked that they were not at all like the other small folk she had met or heard of. Then she transformed back into a young Red Dragon and took flight, winging westward as snow began to fall.

## The Farm

The group crossed the river using Gwen as an anchor — the mechanical lion leaping across with a rope tied to a tree for the others to shimmy along. Back on the road, the snowfall grew concerning. Gundren fashioned four sets of improvised snowshoes from elk skin while Cyrrus and Fëanon summoned spectral steeds to break trail through four feet of loose powder. They made good but exhausting progress until they were within fifteen miles of Silverymoon and the weather turned savage. A blizzard began in earnest.

Patches spotted a plume of smoke through the driving snow. Cyrrus sent his owl to confirm — a large, well-kept farmhouse. The group headed for it with torches drawn and lit, announcing their presence. The farmer was already on the porch in armour with weapons drawn. Patches noted other family members covering them from the barn and upper windows. After the group showed their allegiance to Selûne, Helm and Bahamut — and the farmer realised they carried gear worth more than everything he owned — the man of the house, Ned, relented and invited them in. His wife Lyra emerged from the barn with a longbow, standing down at his signal.

The mounts and Gwen were stabled in the barn. Inside, Tark made straight for the kitchen and met Dairon, Ned's twenty-something son, who was well-armed and had spotted the group's approach. A younger son and daughter came down for food but retreated upstairs. A baby cried somewhere above — Baby Bill.

Gundren descended to the basement, helped himself to the family's ale supply, got thoroughly drunk and passed out beside his bedroll. The group noticed Ned's pronounced limp. Twenty years in the military, he said, and a goblin spear of all things had ended his career. Cyrrus offered to try healing it. Ned was sceptical — other clerics had failed — but Lyra convinced him. Cyrrus cast Greater Restoration and the old wound mended. The family was ecstatic. They broke out a good barrel of fire whiskey, refused any payment for lodging and declared the healing more than they could ever have hoped for. Buumi slipped some gold into Ned's cloak pocket by the door.

## The Traveller

Dairon came down the stairs — a lone Wood Elf was approaching through the blizzard. Ned armed himself and headed out with Tark and Cyrrus. Fëanon and Patches took up window positions. The elf introduced himself as Neero: winter gear, a shamisen instrument, and a small Kara-Turan tanto in his belt loop. The group questioned him, determined his clan name was at least familiar, and concluded that one man alone posed no threat. They invited him in.

Neero pulled out his instrument and played a sombre tune, sharing tales of the far east and producing a fine bottle of wine. Upstairs, Patches introduced herself as Alya to the farmer's young daughter, who liked the name. The bard's genial nature won everyone over and after several hours, the group retired to sleep.

Everyone except Cyrrus, who did not need sleep. Noting the unusually shaped knife in Neero's belt, the warlock asked to see it. Pulling the tanto free, the elf handed it over — and accidentally nicked Cyrrus with the blade. Apologising profusely, Neero explained it was from Kara-Tur. Cyrrus's vision blurred and he collapsed to the floor. The poisoned blade had put him to sleep.

## The Ambush

In the fugue-like dreamscape Fëanon was maintaining — waiting for Officer Li to fall asleep so he could contact her — the world grew cold and dark. An image of his old mentor Theodemir grasped him and screamed: "WAKE UP!"

Fëanon came to in a pile with the rest of the party in the centre of the main room. The house was dark and freezing, the doors flung open to the raging blizzard, and large hulking forms moved in the shadows. On the stairs, a nine-foot, blue-skinned creature with small white horns, milky eyes and grotesque musculature was conferring with a half-ogre. Neero's knife hung in its belt. His cloak draped its shoulders. There had never been a Wood Elf — only an Oni demon from the far east.

In the basement, Gundren waited by the stairs with his weapon ready, having been woken by the thudding footsteps above.

The Oni hesitated on the stairs, glancing up toward the sleeping family and then back to the pile of unconscious adventurers. It decided to kill the group first and walked toward them, frost gathering around its right hand.

Fëanon leapt up, fingers to his temple, and extended his staff. A rippling wave of energy washed through the house — a deep sleep that disrupted the Oni's enchantment and dropped most of the half-ogres unconscious. The party blinked awake just as Neero thrust out his hand and unleashed a Cone of Cold.

Patches rolled under a table. Tark and Cyrrus scrambled clear with glancing hits. Fëanon's ice staff flared with blue light, absorbing the worst of the blast. Buumi and Mr. Pickles were not so lucky — the goblin was instantly frozen and near death, and Buumi staggered upright shivering, reaching down to lay on hands and stabilise his friend.

Gundren burst from the basement and fired both shotgun barrels at the Oni, but Neero spun away and readied his knife. The creature turned a charming gaze on Gundren — and Fëanon made a cutting gesture, counterspelling it in a flash of blue sparks. Patches rushed the Oni, summoning Eclipse in a rush of liquid mercury, her hair beginning to float. The demon's blade extended fifteen feet, stabbing into Fëanon and then Cyrrus, before the rogue closed the distance and forced Neero onto the defensive in a whirlwind of strikes.

Tark vaulted across the room and destroyed a half-ogre with a combination of double kicks, an acrobatic spring and a skull driven into the door hinge. The remaining half-ogres pressed in, flanking where they could and forcing Buumi to deal with them rather than join the assault on Neero. Mr. Pickles, revived and seeing his mistress bleeding, unfurled his whip and drew a cut across the Oni's eyebrow.

The group noticed that Neero's wounds were healing. The battle raged — Patches and the Oni trading blows in a furious exchange of ripostes and parries — until the demon saw his half-ogres falling and knew he was being overwhelmed. He turned invisible and fled. The group heard heavy footsteps ascending the stairs, a baby's cry, and the shattering of an upstairs window.

Patches and Mr. Pickles dispatched the nearest half-ogre — Mr. Pickles stabbing it in the back repeatedly, screaming "GET AWAY FROM THE MISTRESS!" Fëanon rushed out the front door into the blizzard and saw a furrow being cut through the deepening snow by something invisible. He hurled a hypnotic pattern into the storm but had no idea if it connected.

Upstairs, Patches rushed to the window and called for Kitty, but the blizzard swallowed everything beyond arm's reach. Buumi made it into the parents' room just in time to see Ned take an axe to the chest from a half-ogre. Enraged, Buumi smote the creature in a flash of divine light, then knelt beside the farmer and reached for one of his diamonds, beginning to pray.

Outside, Tark sprinted after Fëanon. Seeing nothing but disturbed snow, he activated his blindfold's truesight and saw the Oni clearly, loping through the blizzard with a baby clutched to its chest. Tark shadowstepped into the trees and began closing the distance, leaping from branch to branch. Cyrrus followed close behind on a flight spell, tracking the creature with his Selûne-given blindsight.

Tark shadowstepped in front of the Oni, skidded to a stop in the deep snow and launched a flying kick into the demon's face. Knocked into the powder, Neero rose hissing, his small knife extending into a full katana. The crying baby was still pressed tight to his chest. Thirty feet behind the Oni, Cyrrus floated among the driving snow and swaying trees. The warlock and the monk — both injured — faced down the demon as the rest of the party fought to catch up.
