**The Hot Springs**

Still at the hot springs and having just eaten the two Elk, the group cleans up and begin settling down for the night.

Vaelstraza seems interested in Tark due to his draconic connections and Tark really wants to fight Vael. Tark mentions Bahamut, much to the disdain of Vael.

knowing the relative strength of the party, Vael keeps saying that fighting them would be beneath her, but really it's because she knows she would lose.

Cirrus swims in the spring then sits on the edge, staring at the moon.

Patches has Mr. Pickles brew some tea from the hot spring.

Buumi chills with Aurora, writing in his journal (one handed).

Wondering about the nature of the hot spring, Fey spends a great deal of time feeling the magic of the area. 

He comes to the conclusion that it's a magical hot spot, a mana spring or Ley-Line in tune with druidic magics.

The group falls into a magically restful sleep.

While meditating on the moon, Cirrus once again gets visions of the four Warlocks he has to find: The Halfling in Neverwinter, The Derro in Gracksluth, The Red Wizard in Thay and a Samurai in Kara-Tur.

Patches wakes in the night to something knocking snow from nearby tree branches.  Investigating, Patches finds a small tree-dwelling mammal: white, with bristly ice like fir, a blue belly and large fluffy tail.  

The "ice squirrel" bounds from tree to tree and goes about it's business.

The next morning the group awakes to Vael having shifted into the form of a small redheaded halfling girl, studying Tark.

The group asks Vael again about her traveling intentions and tell her that shapeshifting into a Halfling girl will go over much better with the Dwarves of Gauntlgyrm

She thanks the group for their advice.

Cirrus recounts his visions to the group and Vael, asking to try and narrow down the locations (hence listing the locations above) of each Warlock of Cerregorach .

From clues and descriptions, the group narrows down each warlock to a general location - except the Samurai.

The group decides that they need to make haste to Silverymoon to investigate why the Mythal defenses are active and pack up camp

Vael thanks the group for the company and remarks that they were not at all like the other "small folk" she had met or heard about

She then transforms back to her normal shape and flies off West.

Snow begins to lazily fall.

**The Farm**

The group makes their way back to the river and cross it with ease; Gwen jumping across, stringing two ropes and creating a "bridge".

Back on the "road" the snowfall is concerning and Gundren puts together four sets of improvized snow shoes (the elk skin needs to be cured properly).

Cirrus and Fey both summon spectral steeds to forge the path through the 4ft loose snow, unwilling to use the snow shoes and seeing a better way.

The normal mounts coming up behind have a much easier time, but every hour the spectral mounts must be re-summoned.

Making great but cold and tiring progress the group gets within 15 miles of the city before the weather takes a turn for the worse.

The snow starts blowing with ferocity and a blizzard begins in earnest.

Searching the surrounding snow covered forest, Patches spots a plume of smoke and Cirrus sends his Owl to investigate.

The Owl confirms a large, well kept farmhouse and the group heads toward it, torches drawn and lit (announcing their presence).  The sun begins to set.

The group approaches the farm house, the owner already on the porch and waiting with weapons and armor - the group having approached as blatantly as possible.

It is now a dark and stormy winter night and the cold is beginning to seriously affect the group.  

The farm-house family greets them with weapons drawn and extreme caution.  

Patches notes other family members with advantageous firing positions looking from the Barn and upstairs windows.

The group convinces them they are friendly, showing their allegiance to Selune, Helm and Bahamut.

 The farmers notice the incredible gear and realize they have nothing the group would want other than hospitality. 

 The man of the farm - Ned, relents and agrees to lodging for the evening.  he signals his family to stand down and his wife - Lyra, comes out of the barn with a longbow.

The group puts the mounts and Gwen in the Barn.

Everyone heads inside and begin to take off their cold weather gear. 

Tark heads directly into the kitchen for food, meeting a 20-something son of Ned's: Dairon, who is well equipped and spotted the group coming in. 

 Dairon takes a bowl of stew and heads back upstairs to continue his watch.  

The younger son (16) and daughter (11), come down for food but then head back to their rooms, avoiding the strangers. 

A baby mewls upstais - Baby Bill.

Gundren heads into the basement and begins drinking the family supply of Ale.  Getting very drunk, he sets up his bed in the basement and quickly passes out.

 The group notices that Ned has a bad limp.  Ned remarks that he went 20 years in the military before being hobbled by a Goblin spear of all things.

 Cirrus asks the man if he can try and fix it.  Ned is unsure, knowing that other clerics have tried and failed but Lyra convinces him to at least try.

 Cirrus cures the old wound with Greater restoration and the family is ecstatic.  They break out a good barrel of fire whiskey in thanks and refuse any payment for lodging, the healing being more than they could have hoped for. 

Buumi slips some gold into Ned's cloak pocket by the door anyway. 

 Dairon comes down the stairs and states that he sees another traveller approaching the farm; a lone Wood Elf.

Concerned, Ned get's his gear and heads outside with Tark and Cirrus while Fey and Patches take up positions in the windows.  

Patches heads into the young girls bedroom for a good vantage.

The lone elf introduces himself as Neero.  He has a torch lit, winter gear, a Shamisen instrument and small Japanese Tanto in a belt loop.

 The group tries to get a read on the lone traveler, questioning him and his story.

They determine that the name of his clan is at least familiar and come to the conclusion that alone he's not a threat and assure the farmer that they can take care of one person if he's a problem. 

 They invite Neero inside. The Wood Elf pulls out a long necked string instrument and plays for everyone a somber tune, sharing tales of the far east and bringing out a nice bottle of wine.

Upstairs, Patches says hi to the young girl, introducing herself as Alya.  The young girl likes the name.

Cirrus and Fey are reminded that Officer Li was of Kara Tur and that jogs their memories.  

They Think to contact Li in a Dreaming spell to ask about the goings on in the city.

Fey is assisted into the spell by Cirrus, but Li is not asleep.  Fey decides to meditate in the dream world, waiting for her to fall asleep so he can contact her.

 Everyone is wary at first aorund him, but Neeros genial nature wins everyone over and after several hours, everyone retires to sleep.  

Except Cirrus who does not sleep.

Noting the uniquely shaped knife in Neeros belt, Cirrus asks to see it and where it's from.

Pulling the Tanto out, Neero hands it over to Cirrus "accidentally" nicking him with the blade.

Apologizing profusely, Neero says the blade is from Kara-Tur in the far east, a land of Oni demons.

Cirrus's vision goes blurry and he falls to the floor, the poisoned blade that nicked him putting him asleep.

**The Oni**

In the fugue-like dreamscape that Fey is experiencing, the world grows cold and dark.  Concerned, Fey is grasped by an image of his old mentor - Theodemir - who yells in his mind to "WAKE UP!"

Fey finds himself in a pile with the rest of the party in the center of the farm's main room.

The house is dark and cold, the doors open to the raging blizzard outside and large hulking forms moving around the house.

On the stairs a 9ft, blue skinned creature with small white horns, milky eyes and far too much muscle is talking with one of the other large figures which Fey makes out to be a Half-Ogre.

The blue skinned fiend has Neeros knife in it's belt and is wearing his cloak. 

Neero was never a Wood Elf, but an Oni demon from the far east.

In the Basement, Gundren waits by the stairs ready for battle; having been awoken by the thudding steps of all the half-ogres and realizing something was wrong.

Hesitating on the stairs, Neero looks up to the sleeping family and then back to the group.  He decides that he should kill the group before going to feed and walks toward the pile of unconscious adventurers, frost gathering around his right hand.

Just as Neero approaches, Fey leaps up, fingers to his temple and extends his staff.  Unleashing a rippling wave of energy, a Deep Sleep washes through the house, disrupting the Oni sleep spell and dropping most of the Half-Ogres unconscious.

Reeling from the spell, Neero thrusts his hand out toward the group just as they blink awake and unleashes a Cone of Cold.

Patches rolls under a table to get away from the blast as Tark and Cirrus scramble away taking glancing hits.  

Fey's ice staff flares with blue light, sapping away the worst of the cold damage.

Buumi and Mr. Pickles are not as lucky and get blasted by the Cone.  Mr. Pickles is instantly frozen and near death and Buumi staggers to his feet shivering, covered in ice and reaches down to lay on hands to ensure Mr. Pickles stabilizes.

Gundren bursts out of the basement, firing both of his shotgun barrels at Neero, but the Oni spins away dodging and readying his small dagger.  

The Oni looks at Gundren and a wash of charming energy flows out to addle the Dwarf.  

Feeling this, Fey makes a cutting gesture with his hand and exerts his will and with a flash of blue sparks, counterspells the charm.

Patches rushes the Oni, summoning eclipse in a rush of liquid mercury, her hair beginning to float around her. 

The Oni stabs out with his knife, it's blade extending 15ft to stab repeatedly into Fey and then Cirrus.  

His next actions are defensive as Patches gets to him and goes into a whirlwind of strikes and parries, forcing Neero on the defensive.

Tark vaults across the room, double kicking a half-ogre in the chest, falling to the floor and then springing up in an arab-spring-kick to the creatures groin, stunning it.  He then cracks it's left knee with a roundhouse and then brains the creature on the door hinge, killing it.

The other surviving Half-ogres move in to attack the group, flanking where they can, forcing Buumi to assist rather than going for Neero.

Revived, Mr. Pickles sees his mistress bleeding and battered, about to be flanked by a Half-ogre, and rushes over.  Unfurling his whip, Mr. Pickles cracks it at the Oni, drawing a cut across one of it's eyebrows.

At this point, the group realizes that Neero's wounds are slowly healing.

The group drops most of the remaining Half-ogres, leaving only one in the kitchen and another assisting Neero on the ground floor.

Patches and the Oni battle fiercely, both laying hit after hit on one another, riposting and parrying in a fury.  Looking around, Neero sees few surviving half-Ogres and knows it's only a matter of time before he's overwhelmed by the powerful group.

Neero turns invisible and flees, leaving his last two half-ogres to stall the party.  The group hears the thudding steps of the Oni as it ascends the stairs, the cries of a waking baby and the shattering of the window in the child's room. 

Patches and Mr. Pickles make quick work of the nearby Half-ogre; Mr. Pickles stabbing the creature in the back, repeatedly, screaming "GET AWAY FROM THE MISTRESS!".

Fey rushes out of the open downstairs door into the blizzard and sees a furrow being cut through the deepening snow by the invisible fiend.  Fey throws a Hypnotic field into the blizzard in a flash multicolored rays, but has no idea if he hit.

Back in the house, Patches and Buumi rush upstairs.  Patches pulls out her heavy crossbow and rushes to the window, hoping for a shot on the fleeing Oni but can't see anything in the snow.

Buumi makes it into the parents room just in time to see Ned take an axe to the chest by a Half-ogre that had come upstairs. Enraged by the killing, Buumi rushes the creature and with a flash and detonation, smites the creature.

Buumi begins praying to helm and reaches for one of the Diamonds he had purchased in Silverymoon.

Tark rushes out into the storm, hot on Fey's heels.  Seeing nothing but disturbed snow, the halfling enacts the magic of his blindfold and clearly sees the Oni moving off into the night with Truesight.  

Tark Shadowsteps to the trees and begins rushing after, leaping from branch to branch and shadowstepping forward to close the distance.

Close behind, Cirrus has enacted a flight spell and is trailing by only a few dozen feet, following with his Selune given Blindsight.

Finally catching up enough, Tark Shadowsteps in front of the Oni, skids to a stop in the deep snow and launches a flying kick into the surprised fiends face.

knocked down into the deep snow, the Oni comes up hissing, it's small knife drawn and it's blade quickly extending into that of a Katana.  The crying baby is still clutched tight to the Onis chest.

 thirty feet Behind the Oni, Cirrus floats among the fast falling snow and swaying trees.

The Warlock and Monk, injured, face off against Neero as the rest of the party finish off the half-ogres in the farm house and rush to catch up...
