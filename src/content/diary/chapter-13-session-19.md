The group finds themselves on a small plateau high up on a pillar overlooking the Disphotic Forest of Al Askar - an inner world existing beneath the crust of the planet, lit by untold millions of glowing sourcestones

They survey the area, taking in the sights and sounds of this teeming ecosystem

Feanon moves to check the edge of the plateau and is almost blown off by an updraft.

He cautiously looks over the edge and realizes that they are *very *high up above the “ground” of the area, so much so that its quite difficult to actually gauge the distance.

A sound catches him off guard and he backs away from the edge just as a school of squidlike creatures swirls around the plateau edge before darting off into the distance.

The group continues to prep for their rest as Cirrus, though anxious, informs them they do have time for one.

Feanon summons his mansion (no wild magic to worry about) and the group begins to retire for the “night” (no day night cycle here).

Feanon walks into the Mansion, and sees something shocking and appalling.

Snorbul is there, in the main hall.

How can he be here!? Feanon *just *summoned the mansion.

This opens up a number of uncomfortable questions for the Wizard who belatedly greets the Gnome and realizes the small fellow is in distress.

Snorbul leaves the mansion with Feanon and proceeds to tell the group, who thought he was in Iyum, that he was transported to an unknown place while looking for “soup”

He gestures at Ahmad, the Al Askarian Elf, and says he saw a number of similar looking elves there that helped him get back “here”

He stepped through a portal and then found himself *in *Feanon’s mansion just as the Wizard walked in the door.

The group is puzzled and they decide to get to the bottom of it another time.

They are all alerted to something amiss when every sign of life suddenly retracts and hides in a great wave of motion.

Moments later a massive stormfront of glowing energies washes over the plateau

Everyone dives into the Mansion save for Cirrus, Tark and Patches (holding the bags of holding) who suffer a psychic assault from the energy.

They hear, and feel the death throes of Fawden rip at their minds.

As the wave of energy passes, Tark and Patches come out from cover and see Cirrus, who simply stood and weathered the storm.

The Warlock turns, looking anxious (and with a trickle of blood running from his nose) and retires to the Mansion muttering about lack of time.

Their elven companion from Al Askar enters the mansion and moments later comes back out shaking her head and muttering about “abuse of power”

She settles in with the camping crew, but after being talked at *too *much, separates herself a bit for some alone time.

The next morning the Al Askarian Elf, Ahmad, takes her leave and begins the long trek back to the surface as she’s unwilling to be trapped down here by going deeper.

The group says goodbye and they turn their attention to their objective - The Font of Fawden.

They ask Cirrus if he can still feel her call and he points into the far distance and down.

It is “that” way.

The group gathers at the edge of the plateau and they survey the massive “cavern”, the vastness of it defying all reason.

In the far distance they see a gargantuan Manta Ray-like creature gliding around a pillar.

Scale is hard to determine, but it must be *truly *massive.

Feanon decides to work on a Glider and while he’s figuring out the mechanics, Snorbul begins to check the area for Clams and Shellfish that might secrete Sovereign glue, or something that can be made into it.

Buumi starts to get a fire going, but kindling is sparse so he and Tark move out to look for some.

They get to the waters edge of the pool and Tark picks up a red kelp-like frond, only to find that it leads into the water.

The frond wraps around him in an instant and drags him into the water.

Its so fast and silent that no one sees or notices, save for Patches.

She drops what she’s doing, rushes to the water and dives into it with a splash.

Everyone comes on guard, a little confused at the speed of events.

Moments later, Tark breaks the surface of the water and flops onto the shore, proclaiming that something grabbed him

Only for him to be unceremoniously yanked back into the water.

The group rushes forward, splashing into the shallows in pursuit but moments later both Tark and Patches surface - having dealt with the threat below.

Feanon decides to Fabricate (using the spell) the Glider using Shells supplied by Snorbul

The result is a beautiful craft made from Mother of Pearl, all graceful curves and shining brilliance.

The controls need a bit of work though as he was unable to keep the entire mechanical design perfect in his mind as the spell went off.

The result ends up being a working (they hope) glider that can carry two and with the thermals of the area, Feanon is confident they can knock many miles off their journey.

The group assembles their various means of transport/flight and the Glider is pushed from the plateau and into a slight dive before Feanon pulls up, into a steady glide.

Using thermals, the group glides swiftly over the swirling clouds.  The descent is inevitable though and eventually they begin to dip below the first fog-bank

They have to dodge some indistinct shapes in the clouds, but no one crashes and before long they come out the underside of the layer, though much damper than before.

The vast expanse of the Disphotic Forest extends below them for miles, there are other banks of clouds and gasses but none as expansive as what they just passed through.

Below they see a shattered plane of plateaus at various heights with stalagmites reaching up hundreds of feet, threaded through with glowing Sourcestone and coated in a layer of living and glowing coral.

The vast columns and pillars that extend to the very ceiling can be seen like massive towers dotting the landscape, each festooned with a lively ecosystem.

The glider continues to descend, and they spot more thermals from a volcanic vent.

They note a school of the squid around it but continue on to use the updraft.

As they are coming into the Thermal, a massive form simply resolves out of nearby clouds

One of the monstrous Manta Rays congeals from mist, rising to engulf the school of squid in its colossal mouth.

Feanon tries to evade, but alas it is a Glider, and unable to get out of the way quickly enough

The giant beast clips the craft, snapping the delicate tail and it goes into a spin.

The group dives to assist as Snorbul grabs the spinning tail and then moves to extricate Gundren from the craft

Tark is spun rapidly atop a Tenser’s Disc being towed by the Glider

Snorbul moves aft, matching the spin as best he can and Gundren grabs the glider and tail piece.  

The craft stabilizes its spin somewhat, but continues to plummet

Gundren needs a free hand to glue the tail (mending) but no one is within reach!

Buumi flies over with Patches and drops her onto the Glider

She holds the tail in place while Gundren Mends it 

Patches releases from the Glider, being then caught by Buumi and Snorbul grabs Gundren and flies away on his Broom

Feanon rights the craft only a few hundred feet above deck and levels out

He manages to clear one more plateau before ditching the craft amongst the coral flora of this place.

The rest of the group lands and they continue on their mounts

They travel for hours through this alien landscape, led ever onward by Cirrus

They climb over chasm and cliff and trek onward across the broken landscape

The humidity is intense, but the temperature fluctuates across the plateaus wildly, some with gulleys of ice or snow, and others teeming with thermal vents and pools

After a few hours of traveling, the group comes across an otherworldly sight

Hundreds of large glowing jellyfish like creatures can be seen swirling above the stone spires of the next plateau

Maybe even thousands of the creatures

The group cautiously moves in and the creatures seem unthreatening

One approaches and puffs out a cloud of gas, charming Snorbul into joining their dance

Snorbul starts to wander off before he is broken out of it and warns the group

Moving much more cautiously, they avoid the Jellyfish as best they can, taking a few more puffs of gas but resisting the influence to join the dance of these strange telepathic creatures

Feanon thinks they might occupy a similar ecological niche to that of the Myconids from Faerun

The group manages to distance themselves from the strange creatures without further incident and they trek off across the plateaus

Hours later, they come to a cliff face covered in glowing kelp-like vines

Tark shadowsteps to the top to peer over and finds the water pouring from above to be barely tolerable

The nearly scalding water surprises tark a little but he glances over the lip and sees expansive thermal pools and thousands of small blue crabs inhabiting them

Tiny glowing jellyfish float around a steam geyser nearby

The group joins Tark and they survey the area.

It looks safe, and they move forwards

Buumi’s foot goes through the mineral crust into the boiling water below

He screams and leaps back pulling off his boot.

Skin comes with it and he howls before soothing as the tissue quickly regrows

He cleans out his boot

Feanon feels telepathy from the nearby jellyfish and thinks them familiar until Snorbul points out that “Those are Flumphs!”

Patches agrees as does Feanon

He talks with the small creatures and they are good natured creatures they warn the group to avoid the stagnant pools.

That is where the Sheitan live!

Feanon gets a vague sense of a dangerous serpent creature and….brains?

They take note and with Tark leading the party through the dangerous hot springs, they make it to the next plateau without further incident.

The day is wearing on and they turn to their friend and ask Cirrus how much farther.

The warlock points and in the distance, the group can see a Pillarstone of vast proportions looming out of the mists

It is still many miles, but their destination is in sight

They trek on

Patches notes an odd change in temperature and notes that the next plateau is covered with ice and snow

She notices before they commit and they choose a different plateau and go around

Hours more stretch by and they are beginning to tire as even with mounts this is hard terrain 

They pull themselves up yet another cliff and find themselves level with their destination

The massive spire of stone ascends into the clouds before them, blue coral-like flora blooming in a jungle across the landscape

Motes of energy float on the wind and schools of creatures dart and weave through gulleys

It all suddenly goes to ground, vanishing and retreating into every crevasse in the stone

The group feels a pull and they all look toward the dominating pillar in front of them

It glows with purple light, misty energies billowing off it before exploding outward.  The energy storm from before.

Everyone dives for cover but Snorbul doesn't make it in time

When he comes to, he’s bleeding from his ears and twenty feet off the ground with Buumi holding him by the ankle

The mist had driven him mad from Fawden’s agony and he had attempted to flee

His friend had cleansed his mind

They rejoin the group and continue on

As they move closer to the great pillar, Tark spots a massive creature moving in the near distance.

A reptilian humanoid giant wearing primitive leather rags strides into view ploddingly

It moves to a rock formation with a large bone and smashes it apart

It then sits down and starts to pick up and eat small blue crustaceans coming out to defend their nest.

Tark wraps shadow around the group for the final leg of the journey and casts Pass without Trace, unwilling to run afoul of the giant

They swiftly close the last few miles until they make it to the base of the spire

Cirrus leads them to a hidden vale, steam rising out of it in a constant stream and teeming with life.

At the back of the small box canyon, Cirrus takes them through a small cleft and up a slight incline, working into the stone of the pillar, toward its heart.

The tunnel gives way to a gleaming cavern several hundred feet across with a forty foot ceiling

The ground is covered in steaming pools of multicolored mineral deposits

The flora here radiates purple and blue energies and small motes of light drift through the air turning to water where they land.

Ringing many of the nearby pools are circles of dead calcified serpents, as if attempting to flee out of the water.

Cirrus turns to the group.

This is where he saw the vision; this is where the fissure to Fawden comes out, leaking the Font Waters from above.

Somewhere in this gleaming reef-like cave teeming with life, is their goal.
