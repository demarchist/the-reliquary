In the waiting area of the Crucible, the group waits

After a few minutes of enjoying the refreshments, the doors open and a small group enters.

Flanked by Medjay guards, a nobleman of obvious high standing approaches with Liara and a few wizard/sagely looking types.

The Noble is introduced as the Sheik and he announces that the group has passed the first major test of the Crucible and then awards the group with Bronze badges.

As the group is awarded the badges, they talk with the Sheik to get an idea of the social structure.

The group discovers that the Crucible has not seen a display of magic like that….ever, really.

The sages look over Feanon with interest and though his Elven blood is obvious, they continually refer to him as a half-elf, which really starts to irritate Feanon.

Liara calms the wizard, pointing out that Elves are not treated so well and this is the nobles bizarre way of downplaying that.  It’s super racist.

The Sheik is impressed by the group overall, not seeing a display like that for many years.

The badges all have colors associated with them and the group questions the meaning.

The Sheik explains that each color is tied to a god, which is also tied to a working of the universe.  

They continue to talk for a little while, with Cirrus attempting his best to schmooze.

Tieflings are seen as somewhat of a bad omen here so he does not get too far, though the Shiek and his retinue are polite.

Eventually, the Shiek takes his leave and exits with his retinue after the small ceremony concludes.

Liara remains behind to talk and rejoin the group

The group leaves the Crucible to head over to the Diver’s Wharf to find the Fiery Flower - the boat Lady Taurus has hired for them.

As they walk, they question Liara about the Crucible, Medjay and her place in society here.

As a member of the Usurpers of Rudjek, she is well known enough to have clout with Sheiks and high-priests. She walks in high circles in society but is not wealthy herself

They move through the city, eventually making their way to a much less impressive set of docks.  

Clearly, this is the docks for the peasantry.

The group heads to the Wharf and quickly find the ship, a fairly unimpressive transport.

They board, meeting **Captain Losthook** and settling into the general cabins.

Except for Cirrus, he tries his hardest to steal the captains quarters.

They head out from the port city and head North, sticking close enough to the coast to always see it, but expertly dodging the dangerous reefs.

Snorbul wants to go swimming and searching for the Sovereign Glue, but is eventually convinced that he can do it on the way back.

The next several days of ship-travel go fairly well, with smooth sailing and no sightings of other ships.

Late in the second day though, the Horizon begins to grow dark and the alarm for a High-Storm is called.

The Wild Magic Storm blows in, but the expert sailing of the crew, with the help of the group, keeps the ship on the edge of the Storm.

In the worst of it, a massive surge of energy is drawn into the Runes of the main-mast, causing a Gravitational surge, but being grounded out without much damage (beyond some bruises as folks are pulled to the mast).

The storm dissipates over the next few hours, the worst of it being spent.

Cirrus sleeps again and has no dreams, though claims frequent visits of the foreign moon deity.

The sailing is going well with the group assisting and the ship is fast approaching the Pirate cove, a small trading and drinking outpost frequented by the local thugs.

The ship can evidently dock there, but not without significant danger and the group discusses with Liara and the Captain what their options are.

They think that violence is likely inevitable, but they should go in with diplomacy first and see if they can't maybe sway the Pirates into working *for *Lady Taurus.

At the worst, the group thinks they can always bash some heads and steal back the ship…

As this is discussed, with the map of the coast before them, the group notes how close they are to the Temple of Carthus.

The Pilgrimage is brought up again and the Captain blanches, no one has attempted that in centuries, and he just happens to be transporting the first heroes to attempt it?

He swears to deliver the group to the Temple first, and then double back for the job for Lady Taurus.

The group prefers this, with many answers possible in that ancient place.

They decide, they will go to the Temple first, and sail past Pirate Cove.

As the ship moves away from the coastline for clearer sailing, the lookout calls that four beasts have been spotted moving toward the ship.

Thinking fast, Feanon uses Control Water to silence the ship as it speeds through the waves, making it almost impossible for the pursuing creatures to follow the ship.

The spell does not last too long, but the ship has a massive lead over the confused beasts and they lag behind,eventually giving up the chase.

That night, Feanon continues to work on the Reality-mending spell and becomes convinced he can fix this palce.

He works on a list of reagents he will need for the spell and comes up with a list after talking with Liara:

**Nightstalker Horn**  - a beast of horrific shadow and death representing the Shadowfell and its power. Replacement for the Goristro heart.

**Essence** of **Calamity - The Apocrypha or any other magic Item of Zalaam’s. **Whatever force, god or creature caused the Calamity that destroyed this world must be represented. Replacement for the blood of a Demon Lord.

**Scales of an Al’Jin. **Higher beings and a replacement for the feathers of an Angel. Represent Order and counteracts the massive negative energy present in the world.

**Representation of Power - Black Sandfury Blood. **Something must be a focal point and represent something of massive physical power to hold the spell together. Replaces the living Egg of a Purple Worm. 

**Focusing Item - Hand of a Phaerimm. **Something must work as a focus to break down magical barriers and reshape power. Replaces the Beholder eye.

**Representation of the Natural Order - Ancient Feywild Seed (Erdtree/Yggdrasil). **Something must represent the world coming back into balance and being healed. Preferably something from before the Calamity.  Replaces the Thirteen Tinmask Mushrooms sprouted from a Higher Demon’s blood.


There are still several unknowns, but Liara leaves the conversation excited to think about the possible reagents.  

She believes Feanon will be able to do this.

The next day, the ship races along the coast and the Captain points to the horizon, a gleaming reflection of sun from worked stone visible.

The Temple of Carthus is on the Horizon.
