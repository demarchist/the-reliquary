The door opened in front of the group and those out of the box readied themselves.  Just before the door fully opened, Gundren, Doc. B and JmJm all exited the box, recuperated and ready to find Patches and Lady Faye.

The group walked down a declining corridor.  Ahead of them was a large chamber, lit with glowing crystals.  At the far end of the large chamber a foyer-like set of double stairs led up to a large Dais, with some manner of decorative stone statue overlooking a set of stone rings.  In front of the ring, A Duergar Dwarf.  Veygar, the deep dwarf that had been impersonating Lord Feyndral, welcomed the group.  Attempting to bargain with the group, he showed them that he had captured Patches and Lady Faye.  Immediately enraged at the sight of a bound Patches, Tark charged with a shout.  As he crossed into the rooms threshold however, he was immediately paralyzed by a magical glyph trap.  The stone ring behind Veygar began to shine with light and two more Duergar seemed to materialize out of nowhere.  Verygar shot at Tark with a heavy repeating crossbow, Fey managed to cast Hold person on one of the Duergar and the rest of the team began to lay down fire (magical and otherwise). Buumi quickly ran up behind Tark, touching him and restoring Tark's movement.

The next moment however, two Duergar step from behind cover and attack, clipping Tark but doing no Damage to Buumi.  Battling the Duergar, the group managed to do some serious damage, but before too long Veygar pressed a button on a staff he was holding and four mechanical spiders climb from the pillars in the room to attack.

Battling the Dwarves and Spiders now, the group found themselves beset by many enemies, but were successfully holding them off, killing a spider and two Duergar warriors.  Just when the group thought they had the upper hand, Veygar pressed another button, and the statue behind the Dais started to rumble to life.  The Stone Golem strode into battle to smash into Tark.  Realizing the predicament he was soon to be in, Tark dispatched the Duergar cleric he was dealing with and then retreated from the Golem, but not before snatching Patches earring of fireballs.  Recognizing the serious danger, JmJm used a great deal of magic from his brooch to animate the massive rug in the room, creating a huge animated object.  The rug quickly helped dispatch the last standing Duergar the group could see, by rolling itself up and hammering him as if he was a nail…

Veygar and a Duergar assassin harassed the group, using invisibility and expert stealth.  The Stone Golem began to turn to the group, just as the last remaining mechanical spiders were destroyed, being shot by Thundercannons and being dropped from ceiling. Suddenly, the portal on the Dais flickered to life, an angry red glow suffusing the room.  A strange otherworldy creature materialized in front of the group. 

Floating a few feet off the floor, with robes moving as if underwater, the tentacle-faced Illithid took note of the room.  Buumi could feel the wrongness emanating from it and yelled to the group that this was no Mind-Flayer, but an Alhoon, an undead Illithid. Even more deadly.  Floating above the Stone Golem, the Alhoon performed some quick magic, wresting crontrol of the golem.  As it did this, four more mechanical spiders pulled themselves from the wall, surrounding the group.
