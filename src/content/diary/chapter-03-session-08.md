The final door opened onto a declining corridor. Just before advancing, Gundren, Doctor Breakfast, and JmJm emerged from the Tavern of Doors — rested and ready to find Patches and Lady Faye.

## Veygar

The corridor opened into a large crystal-lit chamber. At the far end, a foyer of double stairs led up to a dais, behind which sat a decorative stone statue overlooking a set of stone rings. In front of the rings stood a Duergar — Veygar, the deep dwarf who had been impersonating Lord Faendral. He welcomed the group and attempted to bargain, revealing Patches and Lady Faye bound behind him.

Tark saw Patches in chains and charged with a shout. As he crossed the threshold, a magical glyph paralyzed him mid-stride. The stone ring behind Veygar blazed to life and two more Duergar materialized. Veygar opened fire with a heavy repeating crossbow. Fëanon managed to hold one of the Duergar with a spell while the rest of the group laid down covering fire. Buumi sprinted to Tark and broke the paralysis with a touch.

Two more Duergar stepped from cover to engage, clipping Tark but failing to penetrate Buumi's armor. The group began cutting them down — then Veygar pressed a button on his staff. Four mechanical spiders climbed from the pillars to join the fight.

## The Stone Golem

Battling both Duergar and spiders, the group held their ground, destroying one spider and two warriors. Just as they gained the upper hand, Veygar pressed another button. The massive stone statue behind the dais rumbled to life and strode into battle, smashing into Tark. Recognizing the danger, Tark dispatched the Duergar cleric he was fighting and retreated from the golem — snatching Patches' ruby earring of fireballs on the way. JmJm poured magic from his brooch to animate the massive rug in the chamber, creating an enormous animated object. The rug rolled itself up and hammered the last visible Duergar like a nail.

Veygar and a Duergar assassin harassed the group from invisibility while the golem advanced. Just as the last mechanical spiders were destroyed, the portal on the dais flickered to life with an angry red glow.

## The Alhoon

A strange creature materialized before the group — floating several feet above the floor, robes drifting as if underwater, tentacles writhing where a face should have been. Buumi felt the wrongness emanating from it and shouted to the group: this was no ordinary Mind Flayer, but an Alhoon — an undead Illithid, even more deadly. The Alhoon floated above the Stone Golem and, with a gesture, wrested control of it. Four more mechanical spiders pulled themselves from the walls, surrounding the group.
