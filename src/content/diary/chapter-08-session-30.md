In an alleyway in Gracksuluth, the group surveys the bridge across Ladueger's Furrow that their target will be crossing.

There's no sign of the approaching prisoner convoy, so Patches and Tark decide to scout on ahead to get eyes on it.

Fey meanwhile walks out and grabs a passing Duergar, asking what on earth is going on in the city.

He finds out that the city has been under siege for 8 hours, attacked by demons from all sides.

The Duergar mentions that the Gates have not fallen, the Harbor Chain is down and the "**Heystavidd's**" have been going nonstop for hours.

The Duergar shakes free and leaves, as Fey turns to return to the group, he notes a Stone Guard Patrol taking an interest in him.

In an attempt to misdirect, Snorbul uses his hat of disguise to look like a Stone Guard Constable and approaches Fey to lead him away.

While this is happening, Buumi, Veygar, Gundren and Cirrus look on and the Warlock becomes increasingly overwhelmed by a sense of anxiety, and impeding dread...

Gundren looks across the city and spots one of the Adamantite Golems at the far end of the city, active.

Fey and Snorbul meet back up with Gundren and Cirrus, who relay the feeling of unease and the news in the city.

Fey quickly steps into a store to purchase some socks.

Meanwhile, Patches and Tark easily made it to the bridge, scaling the massive, fortified structure

Like a London Bridge sized Ponte Vecchio made of dark granite and black steel.  Buildings and shops are built on the exterior of the large, mostly covered bridge.



  - like this, but dark and dreary!


Patches makes it to the other end without incident, though notes a number of locked doors as she goes, forcing a roundabout route involving a lot of climbing.

The Rogue takes out her spy glass and scans the approach to the bridge, noting the caravan: 12 Duergar, a Glyph Sentinel Golem and two automated armored carts.

She relays the information and then goes to get into position.

Tark scouts the bridge itself, finding twelve security posts along its length.  Scouting the first, he sees five Duergar crossbowmen and notes them getting ready as the caravan approaches.

Continuing along to the final two security posts, Tark checks and finds the first empty, though with signs of a struggle.

Leaping and shadowstepping across the width of the bridge, Tark hangs outside an arrow-slit of the security post opposite the one he just checked.

Peeping inside, Tark sees a Duergar in the livery of the Flameguard carrying an unconscious Stoneguard Crossbowmen out of the room.

Something is happening.

Patches reports that the caravan has made the bridge.

The group moves into position to spring their ambush to save Hemeth and Velka.

They send the box of goods via Instant Courier.

The Caravan makes it halfway across the bridge and Patches notes that although the other Duergar in the city have cleared the bridge, a group of eight are following the caravan at a distance.  

She makes out Flameguard badges on the following group...

Cirrus is preparing the move into position when the Instant courier box returns to him, unopened.  He retrieves their items and turns to the others concerned.

Hemeth and Velka were unable to access the box for some reason.

scanning the caravan again, Patches manages to get a peek through one of the tiny armored window slits.  She sees no one inside the wagons.

The caravan makes it into position across the bridge and the group springs their ambush, Tark and Patches dropping globes of darkness, covering the last portion of the bridge.

A cry of alarm goes up from the guards who rush forward, out of the darkness, abandoning the armored wagons and forming a shield wall facing back across the bridge.

Needing to see the prisoners in the wagon, Cirrus casts Far-step and teleports into the first wagon and finds it unoccupied by prisoners.

Instead, it is filled with explosives.

panicking, he far-steps to the other and finds that it too is packed with explosives...

Patches hurls all of her caltrops across the bridge, coated in Drow Poison just as the Flameguard approach the wagons.

The Flameguard trample through and 4 of them drop unconscious while another two get poisoned.  The Flameguard are focused though and rush to the wagons for their objective.

The Flameguard rush the back wagon, placing a breaching charge on the back and preparing to pull the detonation cord (fumbling a little in the Darkness).

Tark shadowsteps to the wagon's drivers seat and looks through the slit there (in the darkness spell), hearing Cirrus.

The Warlock warns the monk that the wagons are packed to the brim with explosives and they have to flee NOW.

Tark leaps away as Cirrus Far-steps and the Flameguard detonate their charge, a pack of thermite that begins to quickly burn through the metal door....igniting the explosives inside.

The rear cart explodes like a massive bomb, the thunderous retort shakes the bridge and throws even more acrid smoke into the air.  The Flameguard are utterly obliterated and the Darkness spells are gone.

Three Dimension Door spells are enacted behind the Duergar shield wall, which has turned to face outward, toward the approaching party.

Standing at the end of the bridge are several new figures.

The largest of which is a black armored Devil, A Narzugon with a cloak of falling smoke and ash.  Several of the group recognize the distinctive helmet as the only Narzugon to have survived their battle beneath Helm's Hold.

The other figures are the restrained forms of Hemeth and Velka with two Stoneguard holding crossbows to their heads.

The Narzugon calls out, proclaiming that it is time that they all talked.

Thinking that no, it isn't, Gundren sees a line of Duergar ripe for a lightning bolt and moves Gwen into position.

Lightning flares from her mouth, but rather than scorching the Duergar, it is drawn into the Golem and dissipated as the golem counterspells.

Fey's Singularity goes off though and half the Duergar are dragged and crushed into the stone-wrought Golem, though their impressive armor prevents any casualties.

Tark shadowsteps to the Narzugon and strikes her, but a flash of ice magic explodes into him. 

The Devil's Armor of Agathys hurting Tark as much as the strikes to the plated Devil.

The Devil holds her glittering axe up high and calls "HOLD!", her troops getting back into position (and seething) but not retaliating, wanting words, not combat...yet.

Patches hears a faint hum, a buzzing that begins to expand from the chasm beneath the bridge, a pang of dread coursing through her as she recognizes the drone of **Chasme Demons**.

Others begin to hear the general ruckus of the city growing louder, sounding as if a massive crowd is coming closer.

The Narzugon introduces herself as **Anduriel** and offers the prisoners to the group in exchange for a meeting with her boss and captain of the Stoneguard; **Errde Blackskull**.

The group looks at one another, and it seems clear to them that they won't negotiate with a Devil, they can take this group.

As tensions rise, the Duergar already hurt and seething, a commotion distracts them all.

Not far away, out of one of the main thoroughfares, a group of Merrogon devils is overwhelmed by a flood of Derro rioters as hundreds of the creatures pour from the street.

The Derro Riot turns and races toward the bridge.

The Duergar re-position to counter the charging riot, but as they do, several other figures step from nearby streets, alleyways, and shops. 

The group notes that the charging Derro all have the symbol of Demogorgon carved into the flesh of their foreheads.

Fey, as he steps from the shop, notes a massive figure up the street behind him and turns, seeing the horribly mutated Ront, Warlock of Demogorgon.

The mutated creature screams it's bizarre two mouthed scream and charges the wizard, it's disgusting tentacled arm reaching out to grab at him as the other, more humanoid hand jets forth, unleashing a wave of Eldritch blasts.

The Incubus/Succubus from before (**Leemok)** that attacked Fey in the alley, comes out of hiding and soars to Gundren, intent on charming the dwarf to its own side.

Nearby, several heavily armed and armored Derro begin to let loose with crossbow bolts and the battle truly begins.

Patches rushes forward, paralyzing the Duergar prisoner guards with doses of Carrion Crawler Mucus, she quickly frees Hemeth and Velka and the small group rush to cover, Patches scaling the bridge to a perch.

Seeing Ront, she aims her crossbow and lets fly a heavy bolt, smacking into the mutated orc.  

As it hits though, a flash of fire washes forth in a Hellish Rebuke, forcing Patches to duck into cover.

Tark shadowsteps to Gundren, smashing into the Succubus and quickly laying it out, destroying its physical body.

The Derro riot rushes forward and smashes into the Duergar line and two of the front-line Derro quickly shift and grow, transforming into massive Demonic Glabrezu.

Seeing this, Gundren pulls a ruby from his helmet and tosses it, creating a wall of fire separating the Glabrezu from their supporting Derro.

With the pressure taken off the Duergar line, the Glabrezu quickly find themselves in a stalemate.

Anduriel, the Narzugon rushes over to the one surviving wagon filled with explosives and begins to roll it backwards, she has noted more Derro beginning to rush across the bridge from behind.

Buumi lands next to her, his wings out, and helps her begin to get the armored wagon rolling.

As it picks up speed, Buumi leaves to the aid of Fey, in melee with Ront, though getting backup from Snorbul.

The three of them quickly surround the hulking mutant and quickly put pressure on the beast.

Tark shadowsteps across the plaza, attacking one of the Derro crossbowmen.

As the fight rages, blood from wounds and the fallen begins to seep into the air, falling as droplets toward Ront, covering the Orc in blood.

The group and Duergar engage the demonically fueled riot, while the Devil holds the bridge and the mutated warlock lashes out with rage.
