**Captured**

**​**Fey'Anon's blindfold is ripped away and he is face to face with the Drow Wizard.

He has a good look around the dimly lit room and understands it to be a guard tower.

Two warriors stand looking out of arrow slits, a Quaggoth Servant stands with a platter of refreshments over by a trap door to a lower level.

The Drow Wizard looks over Fey, one of the priestesses standing at the door leading out to a spider-web bridge

The priestess is the other from the battle.  Now without her helmet, Fey recognizes her as being younger than the other.

The priestess watches as the Wizard turns to a nearby table and looks over a large array of torture tools.

He selects a small pair of clippers and turns to begin questioning Fey'Anon about the hoard of magical items the group had with them.

The wizard wants assistance in identifying the trove.

Fey tries to respond but realizes the collar and manacles on him are silencing him from speaking.

The drow reaches up and touches the collar, allowing the wizard to speak twenty words.

Fey begins ranting and the Drow sighs, leans over and clips Fey's left pinkie finger at the last knuckle.

The other Drow in the room let out chuckles and the priestess smiles.

The Wizard, Shoor Vandree turns to the Priestess and says he can take care of it from here.

She turns and leaves, heading toward the Shrine of Lolth.

The wizard goes on to offer (in common) Fey leniency and a good posting as a slave in exchange for his help with the spell books he had in his possession.

Outside the Guard tower and near the prison, the group watch as one of the Drow warriors plays with a Deep Gnome chained to the wall, cutting at the poor wretch.

The Gnome tries to defend himself with a steel rod, and does alright for himself but is looking quite bloodied after the Drow's flurry.

Two corpses can be seen splayed on the wall nearby, a female dwarf and a Quaggoth, both eviscerated and infested with Spiderlings as a warning to those held within the slave pen.

Looking around in the prison, Patches spots the younger priestess leave the tower and notes her being a lower rank than Ilvara.

She sees another couple of Quaggoth servants cleaning and patrolling with refreshments.

Feeling anxious, Patches sits down in a quiet corner to meditate and pray to Elistraee, summoning her bead of mercury to help her focus.

As the hours go by, Patches begins to feel a building tension.  

She understands the message: something is coming, an opportunity and Elistraee blesses her to take advantage of it.

JmJm looks over the other prisoners and spots the Myconid sprout; Toadstool

Smiling to himself, he walks over, buck naked.

The little myconid is standing with Shuushar and the large Kuo-toa spots the Bard approach.  The large fishy eyes study the bard.

JmJm and Shuushar talk for a moment and then JmJm picks up the little myconid which puffs out his rapport spores to talk to JmJm.

They communicate and the little myconid likes what it hears.  It agrees to be the Bard's new squire, in exchange that the group takes him home - to the great Mushroom grove.

JmJm puts the little guy down, satisfied at his new acquisition

Gundren meanwhile begins to investigate the weblike bars of the prison.

Seeing no entrance or exit, the Dwarf heads over to Patches and nudges her, asking if she's seen a cage like this before.

Patches stirs from her meditation and informs the Dwarf that she has: It's a standard Slave cage with an antimagic field within.  

The door appears when a noble Drow uses an insignia to command the bars to open.  The isignia could be a ring, necklace or something similar.

Patches remembers the houses she noted in command here:** Mizzryn**, the fourth house and **Vandree**, the seventh of Menzoberranzan.

She then calls the group over to her for some instruction.

As the group gathers around, the other prisoners grow close to listen as best they can without being invasive...

The Derro however, with the stark white hair and red robes is right in the huddle with the rest of the group, and in undercommon, begins to jabber about getting out.

Patches is not having any of it and sics Mr. Pickles on the Derro.

Both small creatures pull tiny knives, one made of flint and one of a sharpened claw and begin to go at it, knifing one another a circling.

JmJm begins to yell "PRISON RIOT!" but is quickly silenced by Patches as she decks him with a punch.

JmJm looks sullen and goes quiet...and suddenly yells "RIOOOOT!!!"

Patches says to the others that the story to stick to is a variant of the truth: They are down in the Underdark to escort their priestly friend Cirrus to Gracksuluth for religious reasons.

As Patches tells the others the "Story" and JmJm yells out to start a riot, the Drow outside battling the Svirfneblin have both stopped and watch the craziness beginning inside the slave pen: Two small folk having a knife fight and a naked Half Elf screaming to start a larger fight... The Drow shoots his hand crossbow into the pen.

Toadstool feels the riot beginning and rushes over to one of the Gnome twins, bumping into him...harshly.

The Orc begins to bellow and rage at the bars until Sarith, the Drow leaps on his back and begins attacking him.

Shuushar does nothing but stand and watch.

Gundren tries to calm everyone down for a moment, surprising everyone.

Doc B decides to use the moment as a distraction, finding the largest hole in the bars and goes over to see if he can squeeze out.

As he tests by poking his head out the bars, the fired crossbow dart skips off Doc's skull, cutting him.

The drow shakes his head at the Cat-Gnome and then unchains Snorbul, the Svirfneblin he was fighting and shoves him toward the cage.

seeing his chance, Snorbul swings at the Drow with his metal bar.

The Drow deftly parries and ripostes in a flurry, cutting and pummeling the Gnome into submission.  

He picks up the body and throws it toward to bars of the Slave Pens

Far Across the Underdark, the rescue group is wrapping up their long rest, allowing Megno to memorize his spells.

Buumi hands Cirrus a written letter from Li Tan detailing the goings on in the Barony.

The letter says that mages from Silverymoon have been assigned to speed the construction of the keep, all the buildings have laid foundations and construction is going well.

It also mentions that the War seems to have stalled as the Balduran Navy managed to win their engagement and the Dale-Lands have thrown in with the North, giving the aggressive Amnians and Thayans pause.

No one thinks the pause will last, but it is giving the north time to collect themselves.

The final part of the letter says that the Teleport circle being made at the Barony will be operational in 1 week.

The rescue party decides to start heading out, Buumi mentioning that he can only see about 15ft without light.

Cirrus offers to hold his hand...he accepts.

Megno holds up a small opal and begins to cast Locate the Path.

A small beam of light shows him the direction and the group begins to follow, Tark taking Point but keeping darkness wrapped around them with Pass without Trace.

Cirrus begins to relay Patches rules of the Underdark to Megno and Buumi and gets it moooostly right...

They head out and quickly make it back to the crossroads.  Looking into the cavern, they see the carnage of the fight - dead Orcs and Goblins scattered.

Three large, grublike creatures can be seen eating the corpses: Carrion Crawlers.

Remembering that their mucus is a powerful paralytic, they decide to try and kill one and harvest its mucus glands.

They manage to get close before the Crawlers get spooked and start to flee the cavern, but the group springs their ambush.

They make quick work of the Crawler and Tark looks over the ruined corpse.

With his small knife, he manages to extract one of the glands and tie off the ends, securing it for later use.

Following Megno's guidance, they resume their journey.

The unconscious form of Snorbul flies through the air at the Slave pen and the Drow warrior clutches at his chest.

The bars spiral outward, creating an opening as the body falls in.

Doc B leaps out of the hole as it closes and then leaps atop the surprised Drow, grabbing down the front of his armor.

The Drow comes across with a flurry of attacks, hitting Doc badly and the little Druid falls to the floor...clutching the Drow's Insignia.

Thinking quickly, Doc B calls out to the feywilds and finds a creature to answer his call.  He brings forth a giant Scorpion.

The huge arachnid rushes forward, catching the Drow off guard.

The Drow parries both pincers but takes the stinger in the shoulder, poison flooding his system.

Patches and Gundren start pelting the warrior with rocks to distract and give Doc an opening.

Seeing his opportunity, Doc turns and throws the Insignia into the cage...

Inside the guard tower, the Drow Wizard hears the commotion and exits, leaving Fey behind.

The wizard walks across the bridge and casts a spell.

Just as the insignia is about to pass through the bars, Patches hand outstretched to catch it, it bounces off of a Wall of Force.

The insignia lands on the outside of the slave pen and Doc B pounces on it and then leaps off the cliff, falling the three hundred feet to the water pool beneath.

As he goes, Doc tries to slow his descent, doing a decent job until the last 100ft and tumbling the rest of the way.

Doc hits the water and plunges into the depths, alive, but hurt.

A voice calls into his head: "Flesh for the Faceless Lord!"

High above the wizard walks up to the cage smirking.

The escape attempt ended, the wizard mocks the group.

JmJm saunters up to the bars and engages the wizard.

After a few moments, the Wizard decides that Fey'Anon is not being forthcoming enough and decides to try the Bard instead.

JmJm jumps at the chance to leave the slave pens and try to escape.

The wizard commands the Bard to walk forward and just as JmJm is about to hit the wall, the door opens and he steps out.

As he exits the slave pens, magical restraints and the silencing collar appear on him.  The bard is shackled.

Following the Drow, JmJm heads into the guard tower and sees Fey chained up and bleeding.

As he passes, he taps out a little signal to his friend, inspiring him to free himself.

The Wizard leaves the guard tower, taking the bridge over to the other main Stalactite tower and into the Shrine of Lolth.

Inside, JmJm sees the younger priestess attending the shrine - a place of stone bleachers and pillows arrayed around a large carved statue of a half Drow, half spider.

The Wizard approaches a trap door and heads down, JmJm follows.

Beneath the shrine is a lavish set of quarters, showing a plush bed on a raised dais, a writing desk, a large trunk and the entire place draped in lavish silks.

still they continue, heading down another trap door to the chamber below, a more modest bed chamber belonging to the Wizard.

The place is packed with the groups gear laid out for inspection.

JmJm sees his sword and inches closer to it, but the Wizard keeps him at arms length from all of the gear.

Asking what each thing is, the Wizard begins to go over the gear and JmJm obliges, beginning to tell him (slowly and vaguely) by recounting many of their adventures.

Hours go by and JmJm has the wizard eating out of the palm of his hand...

Far below Velkynvelve, Doc B rushes from the water, desperate to outdistance the Grey Ooze swimming his way.

Bedraggled, the gnome hops onto the shore and takes a quick look around.

Two startled orc children look over the cat and then turn and runt to the nearby village.

not wanting to stick around, Doc rushes north into the tunnels.  As soon as he finds a secluded spot, the little gnome casts Wind-Walk and begins to rush along the tunnels, searching for a way to help his friends.

Out in the Underdark, the rescue team is making good progress.

Any time they see signs of trouble, they avoid it and then re-check their spell, staying on target.

The hours drag on without issue, until Tark catches a whiff of a familiar smell - Carrion Crawlers.

Investigating, the group comes into a large tunnel and spot the creature ambling along a nearby wall.  It has a saddle on its back.

Tark shadowsteps into the shadow and the creature freaks out, bolting but not attacking with its whisker-like tendrils.

Seeing leg straps on the saddle for inverted travel, the Monk quickly straps himself in and pulls back on the reins.

Cirrus sees the creature bolting and pops it with a single eldritch blast, hoping to knock it out of its panic.

As the blast hits it and Tark tries to calm it, its enough to get it to calm down and the Monk gets it under control.

Heading back along the ceiling, Tark admires the creatures ability to traverse any surface.  He calls it "Peade".

Arriving back at the rescue party, they begin to go through the saddle bags.

They find a fancy bottle of syrupy red liquor, a map of the area and a letter.

The map is somewhat rudimentary but details enough that the group can see how to circle around Velkynvelve and come at it from the south as they are currently approaching from the north.

The map also shows a highlighted area in the North west, north of Gracksuluth.

Cirrus casts comprehend languages on himself and begins to read the letter.

it says "Blurg, The Society of Brilliance is being assembled.  We must save the Underdark from this growing malaise.  Meet at Gravenhollow - Skriss" 

intrigued, the group stows everything for later use and continue south, toward their missing friends.

Now with one mount, Cirrus summons a Phantom Steed, a beast of stars and moonlight and the group rides on, surrounded by stealth magic.

An hour or two goes by and a breeze rushes past them.

A moment later, Doc B says hi from the saddle behind Buumi on Cirrus' phantom steed.

coming to a halt, the rescue group greets their friend, noting his lack of equipment.  

Doc B recounts his tale, holding up the Drow Insignia and telling the group everything he learned of where the others are held.

Now with another group member, and a great deal of information, the group begins to circumvent Velkynvelve and head in from the south.

Snorbul wakes in the Slave pen and sits up, sore.

He walks over to Gundren and introduces himself as Snorbul.  

The Dwarf understands enough and says his name is Gundren.

Patches walks over to Gundren and Snorbul sees the Drow, scowls and turns away.

The deep gnome twins, who have been pretty standoffish, begin talking to Snorbul and he gets the down low from them about what they think of the surface dwellers.

Mr. Pickles and Buppido are still fighting, they are exhausted and both on their last legs.

Patches goes over and breaks up the fight and Buppido praises their tenacity with breathlessness.

Mr Pickles and Buppido go off to the corner to discuss knifing techniques.

Sarith, the imprisoned Drow calls out to one of the guards and Patches overhears them talk.

Sarith says that he will tell his captors where he stashed the treasure in exchange for leniency.

The heavily scarred guard goes off to tell one of the priestesses. 

Gundren heads over and beats Sarith again, demanding to know what the Drow prisoner asked for.

Sarith whimpers and tells Gundren that he promised some trinkets he has stashed in the tunnels in exchange for freedom.

Snorbul approaches, noting Gundren beating the Drow.  He likes this.

Patches introduces herself to the Deep Gnome and Snorbul seems to accept her this time.  He asks if she's "with" the other Drow and Patches clears it up that she's not with these other Drow.

Snorbul begins to tell them what he's noticed over his week of imprisonment: 16 Drow, 6 of which are elites, and then another dozen Quaggoth slaves.  

He says they can't fight them in a pitched battle.

Patches tells him to get ready for a breakout, their friends are coming to get them.

Shuushar ambles over, he says he will get everyone ready to move.

They begin to chat with Ront, telling him of the Barony and their Orc friends there.

Ront says he came down here for a reason and Gruumsh has as task for him, to find an object of power in the Underdark.  He will not leave until its done.

He tells the group he left his clan to come down here, fleeing the war to do a task for Gruumsh.

Patches says she too is a deserter and Ront spits at her feet.  

Patches responds that being a Derserter is simply a path to move forwards and get better.

His Orc mind churning it over, Ront goes quiet.

some time goes by and eventually, the heavily scarred guard comes back and lets Sarith out of the cage.  

He tells him that Ilvara has purchased his Slave Contract. He now serves her.

Upset at not being truly freed, but seeing it as a positive, Sarith shudders and heads off to begin his tasks working for Ilvara.

JmJm finishes up one of his tales and Shoor nods his head.

The Drow Wizard mentions that JmJm would be a fantastic acquisition for his house and offers to buy him in exchange for continued help.

JmJm acts bashful, thanking the Wizard for the compliments.

The Wizard continues on, saying they have been waiting for reinforcements from Menzoberranzan, but the patrol is late.

Shoor continues on, saying that with his pull, JmJm will be performing for a Matron mother, the Bard just needs to tell him which of the treasures he should try and hide away for himself...

Thinking that its now or never and with the collar temporarily deactivated for his reply, JmJm casts Dominate Person on Shoor.

The Wizard staggers, trying to fight past the wave of debilitating energies...but fails.

JmJm's new friend looks up at him and smiles.

He removes the collar and the restraints and JmJm goes about equipping himself with his gear, getting assistance with his armor from Shoor.

Then, JmJm takes all the remaining gear and deposits it into the two bags of holding.

Shoor heads up to Ilvara's chambers, she's not there, so JmJm follows.

Then they do the same with the Shrine to Lolth, Shoor heading up first. 

Through their telepathic bond, JmJm knows that as Shoor heads up the ladder, he is greeted and addressed by two Drow: The Priestesses, and a third Drow, Sarith is in the room.

In the nearby tower, Fey thinks its about time to make his move. 

He begins to struggle and make a scene, mouthing words at the one remaining guard (the other now standing outside watching the prisoners).

Eventually, the remaining guard comes over to see what the wizard is about.  He does not touch the collar.

As the Drow gets within 5ft of him, they lock eyes and the Drow is incapacitated by Fey's magical gaze.

Having worked subtly for hours to loosen his shackles, Fey finally manages to slip them, using the blood on his raw wrists.

The Quaggoth Servant begins to growl and hoot, shifting uncomfortably but Fey is quick, he grabs the Drow's hand, touching the collar around his neck.

As he regains the ability to speak, the Drow shakes his head, coming out of his Stupor, just in time for Fey to grab one of his swords from his belt and slice upwards, taking a finger.

Uttering the command word, Fey teleports back to Silverymoon.

He arrives in the teleport circle of the city, bloody and livid, screaming at the attending mage for a Spellbook before the silencing collar takes effect again.

Far below Velkynvelve, the rescue group has arrived and begun their ascent.

Avoiding the Orcs and heading up through the carpet of massive Spiderwebs, the group heads through them as nimbly as they can so as to not alert the Arachnids.

They touch a few strands of webbing and they notice some of the massive spiders stir, attempting to see some prey.  

A truly massive spider shifts from its position, slowly walking in the general direction of the Rescue party, but they outdistance it quickly and ascend past the webbing.

Continuing upwards, they make it to the ceiling among the Stalactites.

Doc B starts to hear a droning buzzing sound coming from the North.

Off on the Prisoner cage, Patches begins hearing the sound too.

Before long, the guards begin to shift uncomfortably and look around, just as the alarm goes up from within the Guard Tower that Fey has escaped.

The guards blow the alarm whistle, a shrill scream that pierces through the roar of the waterfall, just as a flight of horrid creatures darts from the northern passageway toward the Drow base.

Snorbul and Patches look over the creatures, lit in purple from the Faerie Fire lights of the Drow complex and recognize them as Chasme Demons, followed closely by a flight of Vrock Demons.

The base begins to scramble their defenses...
