Cirrus pops back into the material world, re-appearing from his extra-planar jaunt, back in his sanctum room.

There he finds Feanon studying the area intently, with numerous papers, equations and apparatus to measure the planar-walls.

Feanon turns, hearing and feeling the displaced air and shuts his spellbook, nodding.

Cirrus and Feanon speak briefly and its clear that Cirrus is excited, indeed, he wishes to tell everyone in the group what he has discovered.

They head to Over the Moon, seeing a great number of villagers out on the waters of Lake Selunia, including Tark playing with the local kids (catapulting them out over the water by capsizing boats for fun).

Gundren meanwhile has been checking on the production of the Hill Giant Belt and satisfied, heads to the town center to meet with the Alchemists.

The group convenes in the town center and note a billboard going up outside JmJm’s theater.

They head into Patches establishment and get their usual table.

Cirrus begins to tell his story of the last two days in intricate detail.

He describes the plane of Ysgard and Svartalfheim, the long dead GOOD Drow that lived there and their city, and that he believes it to be the residence of Elistraee.

He then tells them he can take the group there and shows them the gold Planar Fork and even mentions the two nice human wizards he met in the city from Sigil.

Patches expresses some skepticism and doesnt know how to feel about the plane of her Goddess.  It’s made everything suddenly very real.

The group enjoys their lunch and Cirrus essentially tells the story over and over.

In between re-tellings, the group decides that they will take Vizeran up on his offer and assist in his ritual spell, for now.

Everyone agrees that the Drow Wizard has ulterior motives and will likely try and pull something.

Feanon agrees and after consulting with The Iron Tome confirms that the Ritual spell is complex and hiding magical undercurrents.

With certainty, Feanon says that the Ritual includes a necromantic drain though he cannot seem to pinpoint the target. (he suspects the group may be the target).

Before heading to Fea’s tower to teleport back to the Underdark, Fea stops by his lab to check on Theodemir while Patches contacts Lady Faye with notes on the spell for Lemerlais to look over.

Fea finds Theodemir gaining control of the new body, eating soup (though shakily).  He talks about the spell with Theodemir and tells him of Elias/Vizeron’s treachery.  Theodemir does not react outwardly, saying he will think on this information and go over the ritual spell notes provided by Fea.

Feanon then has another copy of the notes sent to Megno.

Between himself, Theodemir, Lemerlais and Megno, Feanon is confident they can fully decrypt Vizeron’s spell.

The group convenes at the top of Feanon’s tower and pulling out a small stone given to him by Vizeron, Fea teleports them back to the depths of the Underdark.

The group finds themselves looking into a large cavern filled with mist.  At the heart sits an island, surrounded by chasms save for a small bridge of natural stone.

In the center of this island, rises Vizeron’s tower of dark stone, dimly lit by the light of Faerzress crystals peppering the walls of the cavern.

Strangely, there is no wild-magic here despite the Faerzress.

As the group wonder if they should approach the tower, the front doors open and a figure exits, walking toward the group.

They quickly see that the figure is not Vizeran but another Drow, this one obviously much younger than the grizzled archmage.

The younger Drow approaches the group and introduces himself as **Grein Osstyl**, which Patches recognizes as being from a minor house of no import.

The apprentice of Vizeron tells them he has been sent to ferry them to the Labyrinth as his master is currently working on the spell to rid the Underdark of the Demon Lords.

To ferry them, Grein has been given a spell-gem of teleportation and a small stone from the Labyrinth.

The group gathers around and the young mage smashes the gemstone with a hammer, releasing the spell and teleporting them many hundreds of miles across the Underdark.

They find themselves in a tunnel of natural stone and absolute darkness.

The darkness is punctuated by Buumi’s mumbled swearing as he lowers the faceplate on his helmet to give him SOME darkvision.

**Grein **goes on to explain that the Gallery of Angels lies deep within the Labyrinth.  He then hands over a pendant that he says will grow warmer the closer they get to their goal and then backs away from the group, beginning a teleportation circle to return to his master’s abode.

The group takes the amulet to assist in their quest, and then as a group, head off down the tunnel, into the large area of convoluted, ancient tunnels, natural crevasses and long abandoned and depleted mines.


The group hikes for hours through the darkness, though the terrain changes regularly.

Alternating between natural tunnels, caverns and then clearly mortal-made, though ancient, architecture, the group makes good progress.

With their experience traversing the Underdark and with Patches leading, they make good time and manage to not run-afoul of any monsters.

That is until Patches stops, holding up a hand for the group to halt.

She hears the echoing barks, yips and chittering of Gnolls.

Curious, the group decides to move in that direction, intent on possibly finding a guide, or at the very least some Gnolls to crush.

As they approach, it becomes apparent that the ruckus is from a battle and monstrous roars can be heard echoing through the nearby caverns and tunnels.

The group finally gets close enough to see the battle and they immediately take cover, intent on hiding and watching first.

Before them, a titanic struggle is raging.

A massive Goristro Demon, a massive minotaur-like beast, is engaged with the largest Gnoll any of them have ever seen.

The massive gnoll’s jaws distend, showing a massive, impossibly wide maw, lined with circles of sharklike teeth.

The Gnoll bites into the Goristro as it’s multi-headed flail crashes in, scorring and tearing flesh.

Around them, their minions battle as hulking minotaurs adorned with skulls, battle with massive Gnolls and a horde of hyenas.

The group recognizes not one, but two objectives within their reach: **The heart of a Goristro Demon, and the blood of a Demon Lord: Yeenoghu (Gnoll) Lord of the Hunt**.

The group decides that this opportunity is too good to pass up.

Patches heads in first, slipping into the ethereal plane with help from Tark’s Pass without Trace.

As she approaches the conflict, intent on getting that Demon Lord blood from an unsuspecting foe, the massive Demon Lord’s eyes dart toward her and Patches leaps behind a stalagmite out of instinct.  Could it see her?

Patches darts from around the mound of stone and as she goes to strike, she slips from the Ethereal plane, daggers plunging home.

The flesh and hide of Yeenoghu is like Iron though and her strikes, though true, do not deal as much damage as she had hoped.

Surging with adrenaline, she tries again and this time manages to get a dollop of thick, molasses-like blood into a vial.

She then rushes away, returning to the “safety” of the group as her friends wade into the fray.

Gundren begins blasting, Feanon begins weaving magical defenses and Cirrus begins unleashing blasts of Eldritch energy.

The Gnoll Lord and Goristro exchange vicious hits and in the chaos, one of the nearby Minotaurs is felled and consumed by the mind-warping demon-lord.

Realizing the danger of the Goristro and Yeenoghu, Feanon decides to take one, or both, out of the equation.

A hypnotic pattern washes over the Goristro from Feanon, stunning the creature and many, many of the smaller minions.

Yeenoghu is unaffected though and lets out a roar and charges the wizard, though not before Tark leaps on its back, smashing away.

The Minotaurs and Gnolls lay into one another in a frenzy, slaughtering one another, seemingly oblivious to the larger battle save for two Gnolls that charge Buumi.

Yeenoghu lets out a cackling laugh in Feanons face, which he thinks is too good to pass up and hits the Demon Lord with a Hideous Laughter dweomer, which the Lord’s hyena nature cannot resist.

They use this opportunity to savagely attack the beast and hurt it badly before the Demon Lord can break free.

In a rage, the Lord smashes Tark with his demonic flail (paralyzing him) and then smashes Patches away in a fury.

As the minion creatures drop in the background, it leaves the massive, blood covered Yeenoghu as the greatest threat facing them and the Goristro stumbling, stunned in the background...
