 **Extortion**

The group is sitting at their table in the common room as the Duergar captain extorts their companion.

Tark and Patches understand what's happening and turn and inform the group.

Cirrus looks at the Fort Captain and his two guards, noting that with their message delivered, they quickly turn and resume their patrol.

Cirrus turns and mentions the Duergar guards and gets blank looks from the others, a line of questions ensues.

Very quickly, the group determines that quite a large number of the Duergar are in fact invisible and currently patrolling.

The group decides to frequently ask Cirrus how many Duergar are around, just in case.

A few minutes later and the Duergar Captain has visited the Kuo-Toa and based on what the group sees, a similar extortion occurs.

Watching the blatant extortion, Gundren gets angry, wanting to take it out of the hide of the Duergar, but the others want a more cautious approach.

the ground shakes slightly and a lumbering plodding sound turns them in their chairs to look out toward the dock where they see a large Stone and metal Golem.

Hemeth points it out as a "Glyph Sentinel".  The group ask him where they can get one and Hemeth begins to think it over.

As it passes in front of the Illithid ship it stops, turning and lets out a thunderous bellow in alarm, Runes glowing over its body.

Duergar rush to the Golem (Cirrus seeing more than the others) and the Duergar Fort Captain approaches the Illithid in the common room.

A short discussion later, and the Illithid has been effectively extorted as well.

The group moves out of the Common Room to talk near their ship (and keep an eye on the Glyph Sentinel).

Patches decides to do some investigating and heads to the doors out of the Common room, to the barracks.

Tark too decides to take a look at something, but the Illithid ship rather than the Duergar.  

He goes invisible and leaps atop the craft, its skin pigment changing under the pressure of his steps.

As Tark climbs over the craft, he feels a presence reaching out, inviting him into the ship.

Climbing on top, a great flap of skin and flesh peels back, revealing a ramp down inside the ship and Tark descends into the "hold" of the bio-ship...

Patches waits for the Duergar in the common room to be distracted and unlocks the Barracks door, peeking through she sees a guard RIGHT there.

the guard notes the door open slightly and closes it.

Patches waits for the guard to shuffle away slightly and then she opens the door, scaling the wall immediately behind the guard to was distracted picking his nose.

Now on the ceiling, among hardwood rafters supporting a stone ceiling in a long hallway, the rogue begins to leap from beam to beam, just above the Dwarves (thank the gods she's wearing a Piwafwi)

Patches sneaks through the simple hallway, waiting for the guards to shuffle along and she drops, opening one door and seeing a sleeping officer - not the captain - she turns, waits and then heads to the last door at the end of the hall, unlocking it swiftly and heading inside.

The interior is very spartan, but what it does have is exceptionally well made.  A desk, bed, chest and wardrobe adorn this simple chamber with a large plush and comfortable looking chair in one corner.

Patches searches the room, finding the log-book for the fort, disarming a small grenade trap on the chest and looting it's false-bottom contents (500pp).

Patches finds nothing else and goes to leave, but on a hunch returns and checks under the bed.

Sure enough, she finds a small orb of Iron under the bed in the dust (though not dusty itself). A horrible looking sculpture of hair and faces, tearing apart from one another.

As she leaves, she rigs the Duergar Captain's grenade trap to explode no matter what next time it is tampered with or the chest is opened.  A gift for their annoying friend.

Patches begins to head out, returning to the ceiling to bide her time to escape.

Meanwhile Tark has walked through the belly of the bioship, to an open door and inside, sees an Illithid reclining in a chair of bone and flesh, grown from the floor.

The creature welcomes him, reading the surface thoughts of Tark and the memories of the last hive they dealt with.

Tark inquires why they are here.  The illthid replies they are heading back to their hive with their cargo.

Tark answers a few questions, mentioning they are looking for Gravenhollow.  This intrigues the Mind-Flayer and it asks the Monk if he can carry something there - a small Jade egg.

Tark agrees and takes it and then turns to leave the ship.  His curiosity gets the better of him and he goes to check the other chambers, the Mind flayer opening them, feeling his intrigue.

Tark sees flesh chambers filled with sacks of fluid, within which float hundreds of brains.

Approaching one, Tark sees a small tadpole swimming around within.  

He thinks this is neat and then leaves the ship, rejoining the group in the Common Room of the Fort.

Hemeth is at the bar drinking and Gundren approaches and begins to chat with the barkeep.

Turns out that what the captain is doing is uncouth, rude, embarrassing and most of his underlings are taking issue with it.

Having had enough, Gundren storms to the Barracks door, the group following him and trying to keep him from making a mistake.

After all, why not just pay and be done with it, its pocket change to the group.

Gundren says its the principle of the thing!

Guards come to check out the commotion and after a tense back and forth get the group to stand down and wait for the captain who is finishing his meal (bribery clauses are discussed).

Twenty minutes later, the guard captain is standing in front of the group, demanding MORE payment to work the Lock and allow their ship to keep heading toward Gracksuluth.

Gundren ignites his cannon in anger, but the resounding bellows of a half dozen Glyph Sentinels stays his hand.

The Duergar captain sneers at the group and Hemeth puts his hand on Gundren's shoulder, thanking him for standing up to a bully, but also that they should just pay.  Its not worth dying over.

Patches sees her opening and slips back to the group in the distraction and agrees with Hemeth, as does Cirrus and Fey.

The group stands down and they pay the Captain and head to their boat, awaiting the water elevator.

On the boat, Tark reveals the Jade egg from the Illithid.  This makes everyone a bit uncomfortable and Cirrus tries to throw it into the water, not wanting it on board.

Fey takes a look at it and realizes that its a message - a memory holding gem.

As it's show and tell, Patches hands Fey 400 platinum coins, remarking the Captain might miss the cash.  Fey chuckles and uses the Bank-Wand to deposit the cash back in their vault.

She then shows the group the strange Icon she found underneath the Captains bed - as it turns out, an Icon of Demogorgon.

Fey can feel the chaotic energies emitting from it and reasons that prolonged exposure would cause madness.

They hurl it into the air and Cirrus hits it with an Eldritch Blast, annihilating it.

The water level has risen and Hemeth's ship and the Illithids move in.

As the great Iron gates close, leaving the group in Darkness, the water level begins to drop.

Wondering if the Jade egg is a one use item, or part of a larger repository, Fey attempts to crush it...and succeeds, revealing a memory of an Illithid asking a psionic question of "Will we survive what's coming?". 

A simple message, Fey is somewhat disappointed, but will ask it himself at the library.

The Illithids do not react.

Before long, the ships leave the bottom of the Lock, ignoring the fort here at the bottom and head out into the Darklake.

The Illthids quickly disappear into the darkness.

Hemeths ship paddles onward, Snorbul doing a good job in the engine room with Tark.

After Tark's shift of shoveling coal, he lays down in the dirty bed for a nap and falls asleep.

He is visited by Kenshi in the image of the Monastery and they talk for a while, about the Underdark, where the group has been and where they plan on going. 

The rest of the group assists Hemeth piloting for the rest of the day and they make it through the dark, watery caverns without incident.

Over the day, they take shifts and everyone takes a long rest.  Those that sleep though, are visited by nightmares.

Gundren tosses and turns, buried alive in a coffin, feeling his flesh rotting away for centuries until a great hand rips the top from the coffin and pulls the Dwarf free.

A great horned head, skull like face and muscular yet-rotting body greets him: Orcus.

Gundren wakes with a start, the group awake and around him, concerned.

He tells them of his dream, suffering some exhaustion.

Fey is annoyed as he couldn't get any studying done with all the commotion.

Cirrus thinks on what's been going on, all the Demons and he brings it up to the group.

They all agree that something Demon related is happening but Cirrus goes further - he thinks all the Demon Lords are reaching out, trying to corrupt and create minions.

The group, concerned, can't help but agree.

Patches goes to Doc and has him Scry on the Drow Wizard Shoor.

Doc describes everything he sees: A Drow pursuit party consisting of more than a half dozen Drow, including an impatient looking Ilvara, concerned Asha, maimed Shoor and Jorlan.

The only mount they appear to have is a single riding lizard, for Ilvara.

Doc overhears Shoor complaining about his ruined face, Asha applying a salve.  Asha swears she will fix it if he helps her with her own condition.

The hours stretch on and Hemeth warns the group that they are approaching the last of the Locks before the Dark Iron City.

The group prepares their signal lantern and the ship heads toward the rock wall housing the last Fort.

The rock wall is rent asunder, twisted metal visible as the gates have been ripped apart.  Hemeth is in shock.

The Fort is destroyed.

The group has the ship back into the waterway, aft gun leading and potentially providing a quick getaway.

The ship heads through the entry tunnel and into the main waiting pool.  The fort is completely wrecked, the wall of stone raked and torn, great scars of ice and frost evident.

The ship gets close enough to the dock to allow the party to disembark, Doc and JmJm remaining on the ship.

Investigating the fort, the place was attacked and the group believes by Demons. 

This is confirmed when the group spots a number of Manes, lower demons, and they look to be the Manes of Thanatos the same kind that attacked them at the Netherese Sanctum atop Shatterpeak.

The group annihilates the demons in short order, the demons bodies burning to ash as they are slain.

Heading deeper into the Fort, the group finds the captains quarters and what is left of the captain.  They collect his Badge (damaged).

After a few mintues of searching, they find the door to the Lock control room.  Its locked, but as Patches moves in, she hears a slight noise on the other side.

They call out and a survivor calls back.

They exchange a few words but the Duergar won't open the door and does not trust the group not to be demons. 

 He confirms the theory that the fort was attacked by demons.  Everyone else is killed.

Needing to operate the Lock, Patches unlocks and opens the door.

Inside is a barricade and a mannequin of a Duergar behind it.  The crafty Deep Dwarf however is prone and the barrel of his Firelance is sticking out of a slit in the barricade.  

The barrel glows and flashes and the corridor fills with fire.

Tark and Gundren rush the Duergar before he can fire again, the corridor burning from combusting chemicals, the group singed.

The Duergar is quickly restrained, and quickly realizes the group means him no harm. He stops struggling, eyeing the surfacers with suspicion.

The group placates the soldier by handing him the Captain badge and the Dwarf relaxes, quickly using it to call in reinforcements and alert the city of the attack.

As a thank you, the Duergar begins to operate the Lock, raising the water level for Hemeths ship.

The group return to the ship as the water level rises, but not before doing a thorough once over of the place (away from the lone surviving Duergar).

All the bodies are ravaged, the equipment un-salvageable but find a few goodies in the storeroom: two crates of Drow Silk and a Keg of Svirfneblin Drinking Cheese.

The water level finishes rising and the group takes the ship in, beginning the descent shortly after.

The ship leaves the Lock, as it goes the group sees Duergar Guards heading up to the ruined fort to reinforce it in their own small vessels.

Leaving the Duergar Waterway, Hemeth takes his ship out onto the last stretch of the Darklake, into the massive cavern containing the Dark Iron city of Gracksuluth.
