The group decides to head back to the tower and take a long rest rather than push through the tower wards that night.

Retiring to the extravagant rooms, Feanon finds himself alone

The book reaches out to him and unable to resist its pull, he takes it from the Titanium box

With it in his hands, he feels an immediate relief which only reaffirms that he is addicted to the book.

The knowledge it contains is too valuable to be cast aside though and the Wizard opens the dark pages of the tome.

He learns the dark spell: Torture.

With some effort, Feanon returns the book to the Titanium box and settles in to rest until morning.

During his reverie, the elf is visited by a vision.

He finds that he is not alone and opening his eyes, sees a dark figure shrouded in wispy blackness with a cyclopean gleaming purple eye beneath a cavernous hood, sitting at the nearby table.

Vecna

The dark god greets Feanon and gestures toward the table, indicating that he wishes to talk with the wizard.

Willing to let Vecna give him more information, Feanon moves to sit at the table and they begin to discuss.

Vecna wants the group gone from his world.  He promises the group safe passage from this world through a Ringed Veil, and the information needed to stop Atropos, if they leave this world to him.

Extremely skeptical, Feanon asks for assurances and solid information, but without a binding promise from Feanon, Vecna dances around specifics.

Vecna does say though that he has almost achieved everything he wishes from this world, now he merely wishes to remain here, secure in his power and not venture forth to be a slave to Orcus.

He tells Feanon that the Last Word is not the only way to stop Atropos, that any sufficiently powerful Greater god can reforge the chains that once bound it in the Far Realm.

He nears that power here with his fragment of the word and from consuming its gods.  He could work with Feanon toward a similar goal…

Feanon says that he cannot promise anything, but will think on it.

Vecna says that he will do everything in his power to achieve his goals, he will not give the group a breather just because Feanon said he will think about it.

Feanon understands and then wakes himself, ending the Dreaming.

That morning, he does not tell the group of the vision as he is still thinking it over.

With more pressing concerns, like breakfast, the group goes about their morning routine before moving back across the palace bridge to deal with the Golden Tower.

Confident in their power, the group decides to brute force the outer wards of the tower.

Arcane energies lash out from crystals embedded into the white marble facade of the structure, summoning four massive Elementals.

The elementals surge forwards, unleashing powerful blasts of magic into the group.

The earth elemental is quickly flung into the air by a pulse of wild magic reversing the gravity around it.

The Water Elemental is quickly thrown from the bridge, plummeting 500ft to the ground below (though unharmed).

With two of the four elementals temporarily out of the fight, the group concentrates on the other two.

As they assault the Wind Elemental, the thing splits into three smaller elementals.  It seems the Wards are not as straight forwards as they first appeared!
