5 days until Lady Avelyere of the Netherese arrive

3 weeks until the ball

A Banquet for the Netherese

Feanon works on removing the necromancy from the Demon Lord Ritual, spending the whole night working with his cabal of Mages to do it.

It’s sloppy, but it gets the job done.

Tark dreams of his parents

Sees them leaving their home in the Ironwood Trees of Vaasaa/The Bloodstone Lands

Rides a strange crystalline beast with his parents, taking saddlebags of something

Cirrus debates Yakuza tattoos for Menzoberranzan before he finds out he can be there and NOT a slave as long as he follows the rules and doesnt show worship to any god there.

He has issues with this

Head to Blingdenstone, stop by an alchemist there, trade for a potion of Earthglide.

Head out from Blingdenstone into the wilds of the Underdark, traveling until exhausted.

Patches summons Gravenhollow and the next day the group heads into the library, to the Chambers of the past and present.

Feanon sees the history of the ritual spell Vizeron made, having begun it long, long ago and using his time as Elias in Silverymoon to further the Distortion magic that makes up the core of the spell.

He thinks he learns enough to continue refining the Ritual, diverging it further from the ascension ritual it is.

Patches looks in on Zuggtomy in the present, seeing the Fungal queen at the center of a great mass of fungus in Neverlight Grove.

The Demon Lord is preparing and being attended to by numerous demons.

That night, Patches spots a well armed patrol of Baenre Soldiers.

The soldiers do not spot Patches and she tells the others in the morning.

The group continues on, heading deeper into the Underdark and making it to the Webway, a mass of spider nests surrounding the Drow city.

Tark begins collecting poisonous spiders as they go through picking up four Sulfurwidows.

The group manages to push through the Webway and make it to the other side before needing to rest.

As they rest, Tark hears motion down a tunnel and moves to investigate, coming across a dirty, reeking human man.

Tark knocks the fumbling man out and carries him back to the group.

Patches wakes him up to talk, but the man freaks out so she knocks him out again.

The next morning, the group thinks the man must be an escaped slave and teleport him back to the Barony.

They then continue on toward Menzoberranzan.
