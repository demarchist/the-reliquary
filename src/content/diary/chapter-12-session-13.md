The tension begins to drain from the scene as the crew breaks up.

Tark heads below decks to work on shaping the Turtle shell Buumi got earlier that day.

As he attempts to work the shell, Gundren appears over his shoulder.

Gundren begins to coach the halfling and the two of them together begin to make good progress.


Feanon moves to head to his bunk to study the dark tome of Al Azif.

Captain Drizzly Dawg asks him for a moment of his time and Feanon stops to speak to the other elf.

The Captain proclaims that he has never seen spellcasting like what Feanon is capable of and would love it if the Wizard could fabricate him a new bed.

In payment for the bed, Dawg offers to share a bottle of Elven Wine from the Lost Isle.

Feanon thanks the man for the exquisite drink and then gets to work, shaping a bed seamlessly from the deck of the ship with intricate ceramic filigree shaped from the raw materials provided.

Drizzly Dawg gasps at the work, something clearly impossible without the use of magic.

He all but whispers that this sort of magic is *unheard *of outside of legends.

He asks who the group really is.

Feanon instantly becomes uncomfortable, thinking he has revealed too much and takes his leave.

Captain Dawg is intrigued and does not stop him.

Feanon then retreats to his bunk and begins to study the book.

As he reads it, writing appears in the book, threatening him and enticing him with undeath.

The wizard does not give in to the entity and learns a new spell from the book.


Cirrus has moved to the prow of the vessel and has been meditating there for some time, staring at the imposter Moon of this world.

He has called upon his Moonweave robe to begin to glow.

Snorbul decides to stay near his friend after all the grumblings about “Ifrit”

Snorbul notes that many of the crew are staring at the glowing Tiefling and over the next several minutes, a small crowd gathers.

Sensing his que, Cirrus turns and addresses the crowd.

He sways many, entices others and even angers a few with his blasphemy.

Some of the crew turn to Liara to ask what they should do

The cleric says that this strange batch of adventurers are the first Pilgrims in this age.

This shuts up the more religious members of the crew whose anger turns to confusion, but with a fair amount of hope.

Cirrus then goes below deck to get some rest.

As he moves past the captains quarters, he sees the magnificent bed the Wizard made earlier that night.

He moves past to find his companions and chat with them before bed.

Then, he goes back to the Captains quarters.

Dawg doesnt want another fight over the bed, so he invites Cirrus to sleep with him.

They get into bed together, but then Cirrus makes the man fall asleep with a command.

The tiefling then snuggles up and goes to sleep himself.


Tark and Gundren finish up the Turtle shield and leave it as a present for Buumi.

The next morning, the ship sails on with the group assisting 

The day is brutally hot again and the wind is almost non-existant.

They break out the oars and with Snorbul and Buumi, they still make pretty good speed.

They talk with Drizzly and Thirsty Fingers about the ship they are going to steal.

Drizzly says they should arrive at the Island the ship is moored at by evening.

After a few more hours, a small island is spotted on the horizon

The ship moves in cautiously, allowing the group to get an angle on the ship moored there…and the stone structure dominating the island.

What appears to be an ancient fortress of weathered stone sits atop it, clearly modified with more modern architecture

The core of it looks truly ancient and the proportions are built for beings much larger than humans.

Tark points this out and Liara wonders if it could be Titanic in origin

Wanting to get a closer look at the target of this heist, Cirrus moves to the railing of the ship and simply steps off.

He summons his wings, but there’s a flash of lightning and Cirrus is shocked by an eruption of Wild Magic.

It surges into the sky and rends a hole in the fabric of reality, creating a portal to the Shadowfell.

Four things fall from the hole in the sky before the rift seals on its own.

Cirrus, having lost his focus, hits the water with a splash, just as one of the *things *splashes down nearby.

The others land on the deck of the ship.

Demons of shadow and corruption stand from where they fell, and attack

The things surge forward, spewing corruption

One lashes out and tears an unfortunate crewman in twain!

The group rushes to defend the ship.

Feanon lashes out at one with a disintegrate but these fiends are powerful and it does not kill it outright

Cirrus leaps from the water, hovering in the air with his wings and surveys the battlefield

He calls upon his Sorcerous might and summons a celestial to battle these fiends of the shadowfell.

Tark, Snorbul and Buumi all rush into melee, intent on keeping as much of the crew from harm as possible - who are retreating below decks

Drizzly guards the stairs down below decks, throwing knife after knife into the nearby creatures

Feanon hits another, battling Snorbul, with a disintegrate and burns it to dust

One of the demons erupts in a fountain of oozing corruption and another slashes Tark badly

Cirrus, flying above, calls out and casts one of the most powerful healing spells anyone on the ship has ever witnessed, curing Tark and Snorbul of anything and everything ailing them.

As the last of the fiends are being annihilated, one decides to try and make a break for it, wanting to unleash its corruption on a wider world.

It dives off the boat and swims into the depths.

Cirrus sends the celestial after it and moments later, flashes from the depth tell the group it has caught and slain the last enemy.

Cirrus immediately spins the encounter as random and that the group just saved the day

There’s some grumbling from the crew as they come back on deck but they buy the story

The group burns and cleanses the boat of the corruption and then checks the crew for signs of illness, they seem fine for now.

A few hundred yards from the ship though, is a rowboat.

With all the excitement, and the aftermath of the battle, they did not notice its approach.

Two human women in red robes call out from the boat, asking if everything is ok.

Happy to have a diplomatic conversation the group tells them that everything is in hand.

After a brief chat, the group finds themselves (and anyone else from the ship that wishes) invited to the island the next morning for breakfast with the Lord and Lady of the isl - Nehi and Takhat.

The group graciously accepts and settle in to rest.

The next morning, they get up and have Thirsty and the crew that wishes to join him, row them to the island.

They note the overcast sky and rumbling of thunder.

Approaching the island, they see the ship they intend to steal, moored in a natural cove with steps leading down from the fortress to the beach there.

On the beach, near the ship, is an altar and welcome procession.

A good dozen men and women in red robes can be seen on the beach holding torches, platters and instruments.

The group is waved ashore and are greeted enthusiastically

A palanquin begins to be carried down the stone stairs and the group are treated to their first view of Lord Nehi and Lady Takhat.

Feanon pegs them as Vampires instantly.

They are indeed pale, but they are lounging in the Palanquin in open, but indirect sunlight

The cult they have assembled though definitely seems to be enthralled and have an almost drugged quality to them, though all seem quite happy on this idyllic little island.

As the meeting has so far been quite friendly, the group decides to head to the great hall and eat with the hosts.

They ascend the stairs and enter the grand hall, an oculus in the ceiling open to the grey clouds above

As the group sits around the table, lounging on plush cushions, trays of food are brought out

It is mostly seafood, but it is quite good.

Over the conversation, the group tries to subtly tell the two “Vampires” that they are not food and not to be trifled with

The Vampires, in their arrogance, simply laugh and dont get it, still not thinking that the group is aware of their supernatural nature.

As this fails to sink in to Lord Nehi and Lady Takhat, both of them begin to try and touch the group and charm them with conversation…and actual charm spells.

When they touch the group, they get a small static shock and they find themselves more closely drawn to the couple, wanting to keep eating, talking and enjoying their company

The group realizes that this is likely the couple attempting to prey upon them and they warn Nehi and Takhat once more.

Buumi and Tark share a serious look - if these are in fact undead monstrosities, they have a cult of enthralled victims that need to be saved…

The group are currently guests and though the couple is putting some moves on the group, it has not come to violence…yet….

They continue to eat and enjoy the breakfast, though tensions are high…
