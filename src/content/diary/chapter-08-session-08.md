**The Escape from Velkynvelve**

The Demons fly in, assaulting Velkynvelve

Three massive Greater Chasme descend on a nearby Quaggoth, the Guard Tower and the other goes wide to attack the drow farther in the cavern.

Two of the Drow blast out signals on their whistles, signaling the others to pour from their chambers to take up arms and defend the outpost.

The priestess Asha rushes to the shrine to defend it as Ilvara leads the troops from the barracks to the prisoners.

As she surges forward, two Vrocks descend on the Drow as they head over.

Seeing the massive threat, both priestesses summon Balgura demons to assist them.

As the Drow battle the demons, the group makes their move to escape!

The Rescue group rushes along the ceiling, using flight to make it to the prisoners and assist in freeing them.

Tark veritably runs into one of the Demons and it takes an interest, following and attacking.

Buumi, Megno, and Tark defend the prison, combating all three of the Chasme and one of the Vrock Demons, their decaying and sore-covered bodies proving to be disgusting targets.

JmJm and wizard Dimension door over to the prisoners and use Shoor Vandree's emblem to open the bars

JmJm Waltzes in with the gear and everyone begins to re equip themselves. 

Gundren grabs his gun while Patches grabs her weapons, takes the insignia form JmJm and rushes out of the cell to assist Buumi.

Buumi, Cirrus, Tark, Megno, Gundren and Patches lay into the demons.

The Demons let out damaging spore clouds and stunning shrieks, but the group manages to shrug the worst of it off.

The demons note this, and recognize Buumi as a bolstering force of holy magic and begin to focus their attacks.

The massive Chasme demons tear into Buumi, but he remains standing on his feet, defending the Prison.

Buumi is battered and bleeding badly after an exchange with one of the monstrous, buglike Chasme demons.

As the Demons fall though, the Drow attack from their fortifications, shooting lightning blasts and crossbow bolts into the group.

Farther down the cavern, the Drow from the barracks are stalled as a massive Ape-like demon on tiny wings ascends out of the webs - A Nalfeshnee

It calls out to the Priestesses and begins to talk to them in a guttural voice, stalling them.

JmJm summons his Arcane Hand to assault the remaining Drow and Demons by the Prison and then slices with his Inkblade.

The group and NPC's begin to gather outside the prison by Tark and JmJm as they battle the demons.

With the group finally re-equipped and many of the demons destroyed, JmJm uses his Arcane Hand to ferry himself and Doc B 300ft to the cavern below.

The NPC's begin to gather with the group to make a hasty retreat to the cavern far below as the Heroes create a highly effective screen.

Just as the group prepares to descend, the Drow Priestesses Banish the Nafleshnee and the troops begin to rush along the web bridges and into position.

Patches spots the Drow with the magic lightning wand - the scarred drow with the missing fingers - and shoots him in the hand as he takes aim from within the main Stalagmite tower.

Cirrus follows suit in distracting the Drow by hurling a blast of Psychic Static into the fortification, scrambling the defenders senses.

As the group prepares to leave, Patches hears from within the far tower a faint exchange; "Sarith!? What are you...?" and then a horrific scream that seems to go on far too long and raise in terrible pitch.  Then a dull thump...

Patches does not dwell on it and turns, drops a blot of Darkness over the last two Drow in range and a Smoke bomb to cover their escape as she leaps from the prison bridge and falls to the pool far below.

As she nears the bottom, she calls upon her innate Drow abilities and Levitates down the remaining distance.

High above, the Dominated Drow Wizard; Shoor, is hovering in place and holding out a hand to any NPC that still needs a way down.

The Orc, Ront leaps for Shoor (intending to Dimension Door)...but misses, plummeting the whole way down.

The Drow shrugs and Dimension Doors down to the cavern floor, watching the Orc's descent.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pickles and Buppido cach a lift from Tark while Shuushar and Stool are carried by Buumi and his enchanted wings.

Gundren uses his figurine of power for the first time and summons the great Winged Owlbear; Arkto to get him safely to the Cavern floor.

Gundren, Snorbul and the two Svirfneblin twins clamber atop Arkto and it leaps into a dive, then glides to the cavern below.

The group and NPC's are all ferried out of combat and they flee the ceiling base of Vyklenvelve to the cavern floor below.

Arriving on the cavern floor, the group sees Ront smash into the water, covered in Ice armor and leaves a strange frozen impact on the pool.

The Orc weakly crawls out of the water and the group is shocked he survived.

Cirrus heals him and the Orc glares at the dominated Drow that "Dropped him".

Buppido mentions that the southern tunnel will take them to Gracksuluth by circumventing the Darklake but the group wants the more direct line.

The group wants to go directly to the Duergar city and opt to follow Shuushar to the Darklake and then Sloodublop to secure a boat.

The group wastes no time and turns to the west tunnel, fleeing directly toward Shuushar's people, the Kuo-Toa and leaving the Drow behind in their Outpost.

**Toward the Darklake**

**​**The group rushes out of the west tunnel, barging through the Orc village and scattering the villagers.

Not knowing if the Drow are in hot pursuit or not, the group runs on for four hours, unwilling to rest so close to the Drow Outpost.

As the group heads away from the Drow base, eyes turn to the Drow Wizard with them: Shoor.

They stop for a quick breath and JmJm turns to talk to the Wizard.

JmJm chats with Shoor and the Drow goes on about getting the group in to Menzoberranzan to work for his family, House Vandree.

As the Dominate person spell nears its end, JmJm commands the wizard to allow himself to be bound and gagged.  

Patches approaches and draws her pistol on the Wizard.   

Cirrus waits with a spell ready just in case.

The Dominate person ends and JmJm attempts a re-casting...but the Wizard's mind is too strong and resists the spell.

Shoor tenses and looks around in panic as the situation unfolds.

The group begin to ask him questions and it appears that he's begging for mercy/trying to make a deal, but he cannot be understood through the gag.

He manages to spit the gag from his mouth and utter an Arcane word.

As the Dimension door goes off, Patches fires her pistol and the bullet rips through the Wizard's cheek and teeth...Shoor is gone in a spray of blood and cloud of gunpowder smoke.

Thinking quickly, they scoop up Shoor's teeth and hand them to Doc B to Scry on the Wizard.

Peering into the Amethyst, the vision resolves into the Drow, on all fours in a light less cavern, blood pattering to the stone from his ruined face.

Hands shaking, he pulls a potion from his belt and manages to drink it and the wounds begin to re-knit, though appear to leave some pretty terrible scarring.

As Doc watches, the Wizard inscribes and finishes a Teleportation circle, and returns to Velkynvelve in a flash of purple light.

Figuring they should leave the area quickly, the group all pick up the pace, heading quickly toward The Crossroads and then the Darklake.

Eventually though, they know they need to find a spot or risk exhaustion and risk running into something else out in the Darkness.

The group finds a small chamber and set up the Tiny hut, trapping and alarming the only way into this small cavern.

The eight or so hours go by uneventfully but most of those who sleep do so fitfully, visited by terrible nightmares of dark things.

During the rest though, Doctor B talks with the Svirfneblin twins, and with Tark's astute nose, they discern that the twins are Wererats and unsure how to deal with that.

Cirrus knows that his lady is the goddess of good lycanthropes and offers to pledge the twins to his goddess to help them with their curse. 

Their unease and fear of their own condition is enough that Cirrus' promises are too good to pass up and the twins agree.

Cirrus conducts a ceremony of dedication and the twins decide to head topside to Selnuia once it is over.

The group shares some morning rations of cheese, nuts, dried meats and the Bluecap bread Patches and Doc B baked a few days back.

Now ready to travel again, Megno tells Fey'Anon of their location and picks up a rock, bringing a piece of the target for Fey to teleport back to his group.

Topside, Fey Anon has taken the time to relax and have his injuries seen to at the Lady's College.

Buumi opts to return to the surface as he is still dealing with the fallout from Neverwinter and family deaths but thanks the group for calling on him like they promised.

Buppido sees an opportunity to go some place new and leaps to join the teleport.

Buumi says goodbye to his friends, and has them promise to call on him again when needed.

Megno swears about being too old for this shit...

Moments later, in a flash, they leave.

Now a much smaller group, they head back to the tunnels to continue west, Shuushar, Tark and Patches leading.

As they go, Shuushar mentions his meditation skills and Tark is interested in learning from him.

As they continue, the groups curiosity turns to the Orc, Ront.

They talk with the Warlock of Gruumsh and begin to think that the Artifact of power he was sent down to recover may be another fragment of The Last Word.

Tark pulls the piece from his bag and suffers it's burning affects, showing the Orc.

In awe, Ront responds that he is not sure, but it could very well be what he is supposed to be looking for.  

He says he will join the group by proving his strength by killing Tark, clearly the weakest of the group and taking his place...

Cirrus gets a good chuckle and agrees, looking forward to their 1v1.

Meanwhile, Fey'Anon has teleported back to the Underdark, though even with the rock to act as an anchor, the Teleport is off target and he finds himself in a light less cavern.

Using their own spells though, the main group discovers where Fey is and head to collect him, startling the Wizard who was unsure if the approaching noise was from his allies or enemies.

With Fey back with the group, he re-equips his items and tosses the Drow Sword he had liberated from one of the elite warriors, into the bag of holding.  

+2 Keen Adamantite Sidesword (1d8). Destroyed by exposure to Sunlight for 1 hour.  Currently has Drow Poison on it.

Missing a finger though, Fey turns to Doc and asks for some assistance.  

Looking on in confusion, the rest of the group sees Doc hold a paw to the stump where the missing finger would be.  

Fresh water splashes across the injury and over the next few minutes, the finger re-grows!

Tark thinks that's really neat.

The group all ready to head out once more, Doc B sets out the flower petals and his pipe and blows a great cloud to scoop them up with a Wind Walk.

The group rushes through the tunnels, the incorporeal Shuushar, Patches and Snorbul leading the group through the tunnels. 

They begin following streams of water as they begin to join together, flowing toward the Darklake.

The group blazes past the Crossroads in a matter of hours and continue on, turning what should have been a five day journey, into two days of travel.

Speeding past, they bypass Popmite nests, Fungal chimneys and all the dark denizens between them and the Darklake.

If there is Drow Pursuit, they outdistance it dramatically.

As the spell ends for the day the group still feels fresh, having been magically sped along.  

They decide to push on as Shuushar believes them to be only a handful of hours from The Darklake.

JmJm pulls out a small gem and casts a divining spell, helping to set the group on the right path.

As they begin travelling again on foot, the group comes across a lone traveller.

Approaching the figure in the cavern, he panics and goes to cast Teleport to leave but Fey Counterspells it.

The group rushes into the cavern and confront a very panicked looking Orog.

Tall, muscular, with blue skin and moderate tusks.  The male Orog is wearing an elegant silk suit with a golden collar and shoulder pads.

The Orog backs away from the group as they approach and he calls out telepathically to them.

The group begin to talk to him and discover that his name is Blurg of the Society of Brilliance and he is looking for his lost mount; Centi (Peade).

Recognizing the name Blurg from the letter on Peade, the group begins to question him about the Society and Gravenhollow.

Blurg tells them (telepathically) that he and the others are working to figure out what malaise is affecting the Underdark.  

He seems unwilling to take the group to Gravenhollow based on the Counterspell and threatening posture of the group.

As the party insists and press him, he steps back into the stone wall of the tunnel, melding into the stone and vanishing...

Heading on in the collected gloom of Pass Without Trace, the group silently follow a small stream that slowly grows until it is a rapidly flowing river

The river comes to an abrupt end as it goes under a wall and the group gather to discuss

Needing to know the distance from the river here, to the Darklake itself, Shuushar volunteers to swim it and report back.

Tark decides to go along as well, using his Shadowstep to cover the distance quickly.

JmJm leaps on in, Altering his shape to include gills.

The three of them dive into the dark waters and disappear.  

Fifteen minutes later, they return.

A one way trip of over seven minutes is most likely deadly to anyone that cannot teleport or breathe underwater.

Realizing that they do not need seven minutes of air, just the ability to move and carry people quickly, the group decides to use the space they have left in their Bags of Holding to ferry people.

Although the bags only hold ten minutes of air, and they are mostly full, between Tark Shadowstepping and Cirrus enacting Far Step, the two of them quickly ferry everyone underwater and through the dark tunnel.

Ront tries to swim the tunnel himself and almost drowns, until Tark shadowsteps by and lets him into one of the bags of holding.

Bursting forth on the other side, they open their bags of holding and the group tumbles forth, hearing the eerie lap of the Darklake as the stone walls, pillars and columns ascend into absolute darkness.

The local area of cavern is dimly lit with Water-Orb fungi that bob in the shallows of the lake.  Farther up the shore, a small grove of Torchstalks stand, their sappy caps glinting in the faint blue light.

Tark and Gundren head over to harvest some of the Stalks as the others grab a handful of the Water Orbs, not willing to leave valuable supplies.

Shuushar looks across the Darklake; his home.  He mentions that the Darklake itself is not a single large body of water, but a series of interconnected routes, chambers, flows and several truly vast caverns.

Patches pulls out her telescope and looks at something.  Sure enough, through the telescope she can just catch the twinkle of far distant fire-light: the town of Sloodublop.

Pointing it out, the group realize they are close and begin to head along the shoreline of gritty sand, slablike stones and the occasional scree pile, the Dark waters lapping quietly.

They head quietly and steadily toward the distant settlement, careful not to attract any unwanted attention.

After several hours, the far-off torchlight has resolved itself enough to be easily spotted and identified.  

More concerning though is that the group has spotted a large section of fallen boulders.

This part of the great caverns has some soft glowing lichen and smaller species of mushrooms growing, giving the area a blue pall of dim light.

Feeling uneasy about the Boulder field, Tark and Patches head in stealthily to check it out and sure enough, find an enemy force waiting for them.

The boulder field contains almost twenty Kuo-Toa, waiting in ambush.

Tark hears them talking in their burbling language about catching new prey for the Deep Father.

Returning to the group, the Monk and Rogue relay the information.  The group decides to take the element of Surprise away from the fish men.

They ask Shuushar if this is normal and the Fish-Monk replies that he's not entirely sure.  It seems a little strange to him, wondering if they are guards for the town.

Tark mentions being "sacrificed to the Deep one".  

This confuses Shuushar as he only recognizes the Sea Mother as a deity for his people.

Shuushar mentions that he hopes to bring his enlightened ways back to his people.

Tark then goes on to ask if his people are violent, to which Shuushar replies "extremely"...

Cirrus picks up a small rock, casts Light on it and then closes his fist around it.  He hands it to Tark.

Tark then shadowsteps into the sky and hurls the stone.  

Like a streaking comet, the blazing stone soars into the Boulder field below. 

The startled Kuo-Toa let loose a battle cry and charge the group from their cover, some splashing through the shallow waterline.

It is a slaughter. 

A fireball from Fey detonates in their midst incinerating several as Gundren fires shot after shot and Cirrus hurls Eldritch Blasts.

Patches, Tark and JmJm close quickly, destroying any that rise against them and Doc B calls down a burning beam of moonlight on the Kuo-Toa Leader.

As the group picks off each of the attackers, Tark is surrounded in melee by many of the larger fish-men.

Howling about sacrifices to the Deep Father, they die beneath the Monks fists and are shredded as Patches joins the fray.

In moments, the Kuo-Toa lie dead, the shoreline frothy with blood, the lights of Sloodublop twinkling in the distance...

Chapter 10

**Sloobludop and the Cult of the Deep Father**

 Looking around at the dead, the group takes stock of what just happened.

Shuushar ambles over, commenting that the ambush by these Kuo-Toa is out of sorts.

The group discusses what to do next.

Snorbul meanwhile offers the group a job; to take him to Blingdenstone.

If the group helps him, he says he will pay them handsomely.

Tark doesn't believe him and neither does Patches, they both resolve to keep an eye on the Deep Gnome.

They end up deciding to continue to Sloobludop with Patches on ahead to scout.

Continuing on along the gloomy shoreline of the Darklake, water gently laps at the cavern stone, the group makes their way closer to the city.

After two more hours, the glow of the Kuo-Toa Dwellings are much closer.

Patches hears movement, and then moments later sees several large fish-men loping toward the group.

Unlike the last group that were covered in grisly trophies, these adorn themselves with Sea-Shells

Turning and rushing back to her friends, Patches warns them of another group approaching, but that they look...nicer

The group prepares to defend themselves, but are put at ease when a voice calls out to them from the darkness.

The Kuo-Toa leader, using a spell to communicate, offers a truce and parlay.

The group accepts and move forward to talk with the leader of the Kuo-Toa.

He introduces himself as Ploopploopeen or "Ploop" and is the arch priest of the Sea Mother in Sloobludop.

He then asks for the group's help in exchange for the promise of transportation across the lake.

The group heads into the city its tall ramshackle buildings ascend at least thirty feet high (sometimes more) and have primitive bridges lashed between them

The whole place feels almost reed-like with the tall, slightly swaying buildings.

Kuo-toa bustle around, scurrying to and fro, up on the bridges as much as the ground.

Everything smells like fish guts and the ground itself is muddy and fetid

The place is dimly lit by an orange moss , giving the illusion of torchlight.

As they move in to the city proper, Shuushar peels off to see if his friend Lamamamoo could put the group up for the night.

Off at the north side of the town, the group can just make out a large ship, clearly of Duergar make.

When asked, Ploop mentions the Cult captured "the Duergar" this morning.

The group continues to follow Ploop, coming across a large statue of a humanoid woman

The ancient statue is partially broken, the parts replaced with crawfish carapace, lashed onto the stone by fish gut

As the group passes it, they see four huge Kuo-Toa seemingly standing guard, walking a patrol around the area.

Smaller Kuo-Toa surround the shrine, walking in circles and offering praise.  

As the group watches, one of the Kuo-Toa regurgitates a bunch of fish into a pile at the statue's feet

The group notes piles of rotting food at the feet of the statue - offerings to a scavanger goddess

A hundred feet away, the group notes the Shrine of the Deepfather that Doc B described to them from his scrying; two massive Octupi tied together atop a manta and staked to the ground.

Blood covers the altar to the Deep Father and as the group watches, they see two Kuo-Toa drag a third over and gut it on the altar.

As the Kuo-Toa gurgles and dies, its assailants toss it into a watery pit beneath the Altar...

The group head into the abode of Ploop and finally begin to understand what is happening.

Talking with Ploop, he tells them of the rise of the Cult of the Deep Father that began a few weeks prior

At first it was a small cult that was sacrificing animals, so no one cared.  

Then four days ago, Ploop's own daughter; Blopp declared herself the high priest of the Deep Father and ramped up the blood sacrifices.

The town is on the edge of a Civil War.

Even worse, the blood sacrifices are being tossed into the Darklake and are being consumed by...something.

Lastly, Blopp has captured a Duergar merchant and intend to sacrifice him later that day, after already killing his Derro friend that morning.

The group are not quite sure how to react or what to do.

Patches slips out to try and get closer to the Duergar and do reconnaissance.

Climbing up one of the rickety buildings, Patches uses her bracers of Aranae to swing down behind the Altar of the Deep Father.

Close enough to talk to the Duergar.

Patches talks to the Duergar - **Hemeth** and tells him they will get him out of his predicament in exchange for transport on his Barge.

Hemeth enthusiastically agrees and hides one of the venomous daggers Patches gives him.

As Patches turns to go, Hemeth asks the Drow to help his "little girl" on his ship.

Leaving the area, Patches sees a Derro body impaled on the back side of the altar...

Back in Ploop's place, Fey'Anon connects the rise of the cult with the other happenings in the Underdark.

The others agree.

Ploop then clarifies the help he's looking for; He wants the group to help him kill the leaders of the Cult, his Daughter.

Another large Kuo-Toa enters, introducing himself as Ploop's son; Klib.  He reiterates his father's request.

Tark is aghast that he would be willing to kill his own daughter (and Klib's sister)

Seeing what the cult was up to, no one else really thinks much of it, especially when Ploop offers a reward to further entice the group.

The Kuo-Toa gestures at a handful of chests and Gundren goes over to inspect them and their contents.

He quickly agrees to go kill Blopp when he sees that they contain a fair amount of treasure.

Fey and Cirrus convince Ploop to pay them half up front and the Kuo-Toa agrees.

Fey uses the depositing wand and whisks away half of the treasure.

Gundren heads out of the abode and Tark follows, concerned.

As Gundren lines up a shot with his cannon at the nearest Cultist, Tark leaps in the way, blocking the shot.

Tark begs the group to at least try and rescue the Duergar without bloodshed.

Grumbling and upset he was stopped, Gundren agrees and the others move in to position to try a more subtle approach.

As Patches approaches one of the guards, it stands tall and hisses, threatening her with his spear

Fay'Anon walks behind her and subtly casts Polymorph on Hemeth.

Hemeth disappears, turning into a small bat and begins to fly out of the cage, toward his large Duergar Barge currently docked along the norther side of the "city".

The moment the Kuo-Toa guarding Hemeth notice he's missing, they shriek out in alarm.

The shrieking spreads and two large Kuo-Toa exit a nearby shack and scream, inciting their followers to attack.

The powder keg blows as both factions begin to rush to action, Ploop and his forces heading forward with the group to attack the Cultists.

JmJm begins to sing and twirl his sword, causing a distraction for the wizard behind him.

Fey'Anon creates a singularity, crushing a dozen of the fish men as they rush at JmJm.

Seeing the carnage though, Fey realizes that the majority of these creatures are little threat, and feels a little sick.

Tark shakes his head in disappointment and resolves himself, he charges the leaders of the Cult that he saw exit the building.

He begins to pummel one of the creatures as it steps in to block him.

Patches throws out one of the cards from her Deck of Illusions and a hulking human druid with deer antlers and thick leather armor appears amidst the charging Cultists.

Patches then leaps in beside the Halfling and they make short work of the Kuo-Toa Monitor blocking their path.

Doc B summons a moonbeam to scorch the Cult members and Cirrus begins popping off Eldritch blasts. 

 Gundren starts shooting.

Across the city, Kuo-Toa fight Kuo-Toa and the streets start to become slick with blood, the nearby water growing red and beginning to churn.

Under the burning Moonbeam, one of the Cult leaders, a massive Kuo-Toa, begins to shake and tremble as his form starts to change..
