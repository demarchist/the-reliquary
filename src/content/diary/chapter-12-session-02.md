Cirrus remains awake all night, refusing to sleep.  He grows exhausted.

As the group sets off, the temperature rises quickly, forcing the group to don their hot weather gear and worry about water rations.

As the hours of hiking the hot rocky hills draw on, the group sees that they are almost to the coast and to easier terrain.

So relieved are they, that they do not notice the creatures sneaking up on them.

A pack of ravening monsters leaps down from the rocky slopes above and charges the group.

The largest spew forth great torrents of burning Acid, showering the group with pain.

Cirrus takes a blast full to the face as he attempts to Ice-block from damage, but his magic does not function.

As he burns, the Kuthrik walks up and spears the warlock with a long Talon.

Cirrus shakes in agony, but does not scream…

The Kuthrik is forced away by Tark and Cirrus runs to take cover behind a nearby boulder, sobbing in pain…

With Feanon and Gundren both wielding Staff Weapons, Snorbul and Tark the group destroys the largest of the strange creatures and the rest flee.

Buumi feels useless and fat, having lost his belt and realized how weak he’s become, he becomes resolved to get fit again.

He Carries Cirrus who is horribly wounded and exhausted, back to the group.

Liara heals the worst of it and Tark brings out his healers kit to further patch folks up.

They take a short rest and then continue on.

As they finally make it out of the badlands and into the rolling coastal hills, the group questions if maybe they should find shelter soon.

As the sun begins to disappear, they find a good defensible spot to set up.

Cirrus once again refuses to sleep.

The group is now quite worried and they try to force Cirrus to sleep by having Liara sing him a charming lullaby about the Moon being chased by the smaller, rapidly orbiting star of the binary system.  He enjoys the moon-related lullaby.  He resists and stays awake.

That night, Cirrus has a rare moment of insight.  There’s a glimmer of sanity still in there, he’s holding on, but just barely…

As Feanon looks at the Warlock with something approaching concern (but definitely NOT concern…) he wonders if his Deep Slumber Spell could be modified with pre-programed dreams to prevent nightmares?

He goes back to his Iron Tome, all unfolded before him and covered in metal lettering.

Liara looks on with apprehension and mentions that Wizards, or Spellcasters do not display their Arcane nature (i.e Book) so brazenly.  To do so would invoke Ire as magic is what broke the world.

Feanon reacts condescending and goes back to his research into fixing the broken Weave of this world.

The next morning Buumi gets up early and grills up some of the meat they harvested from the Monsters the previous day.

He grills them to perfection and everyone eats well.

The group asks about the city they are headed to and Snorbul is excited to learn that it may be the location of the brilliant Reef he saw in his vision, showing a source of Sovereign Glue.

They also discover that a Ruby Dragon is known to frequent the area and has been seen regularly for centuries - until recently (many weeks).

Cirrus is even more exhausted…

The heat this day is even more severe, as both Suns rise high this day.

The heat scorches across the dusty red hills, the nearby ocean glittering under the green sky.

The group grows exhausted by the heat and Cirrus practically falls over, barely able to remain conscious.

The group manage to find a shaded spot for a break to wait out the worst of the heat - they definitely think they should travel at night.  The idea of a ship is floated and Buumi points out a few ships on the horizon.

Liara mentions they will be expensive (and we are poooooooor) and also still dangerous.

With the frequent Highstorms that blow through and aquatic monsters, Boating is still hazardous.

As the temperature wanes, the group begins to continue on to the North, to Ras Alkan.

Tark goes on ahead to scout, climbing a nearby rock feature.

With his vantage, Tark sees an architectural shape up ahead - a spire of white stone.

Tark returns, mentioning the building and Liara perks up saying its a trading post and safe haven for travelers - an Oasis.

Exhausted from the heat, and eager to find some work for some money, the group heads with new purpose to the Spire as they take turns carrying Cirrus.

As the group nears their destination, Tark once again moves on ahead to scout.

He comes across a destroyed caravan, corpses scattered and being gnawed upon by feral canine-esque beasts.

Tark retreats and warns the party.

they all think they should avoid the battle in their current state.

Except for Buumi.  He thinks they should lure the beasts into an ambush and destroy them.

If the group doesnt kill these creatures, they may hurt someone else, and what better way to ingratiate themselves with the locals then to kill a pack of dangerous beasts.

Gundren points out they can then loot the merchant Caravan too as it’s clearly “finders keepers” law out here…

The group finds a suitable rock formation for an ambush and Tark moves out to lure the beasts into a box canyon to be crushed by dropping rocks, shot from fusillade by Gundren and Feanon and then battled by Buumi and Tark.

The monk hurls his darts, striking the dark beasts and they bound after the monk.

Tark rushes back to the group, the enemy in pursuit, the group ready and waiting…
