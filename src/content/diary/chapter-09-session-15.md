As Gurnik turns to leave, the group stops him and decide NOT to bring any elementals in to Rockblight until The Bane is dealt with.

Gurnik agrees, but prepares his acolytes to potentially push into Rockblight post-hallow spell.

The group collects themselves and then head back to the the passage into Rockblight and the ruins of Blingdenstone.

They make good time back to The Steadfast Stone and make it there un-accosted, with no sight of the Dust Mephit gang from before.

The group feels the cursed site and the rage filling the caverns, they set up expecting trouble…

Feanon approaches the great Menhir, stopping a safe distance away and examining the standing stone.

He figures out quickly which socket to place the spell gem into and then Mage hands the gem into place.

The Sapphire flashes and glows a powerful blue, the stone shattering and releasing the magic contained within.

A cloud of swirling gasses and blazing lightning erupts from the standing stone and begins to whirl, winds howling.

Red blasts of lightning lance out from the cloud and strike the cavern walls floor and moments later, enraged elementals slide from the rock as if stepping from a pool of water.

The elementals surge forward, attacking the group in a furious avalanche of animate stone.

As the group braces and defends from the elemental onslaught, a blue glow appears on the ground near the standing stone.

A glowing crystal hand reaches from the stone and a roughly humanoid crystal creature, wide and squat, pulls itself from the stone.

The crystalline Galeb Duhr slams its fists together and its glow intensifies.

The standing stone begins to glow, previously invisible runes and carvings beginning to illuminate up its length and a shimmering field of blue energy begins to radiate from the stone.

The nearby elementals roar in anger and turn toward the Galeb Duhr, several charging the thing to destroy it and stop it from cleansing the area.

Two more spots begin to glow on the stone, blue light pouring from cracks in the earth, creating three points of an equilateral triangle around the Menhir.

Cirrus sees the Elementals charging the crystal creature and decides to protect it with everything he has, Farstepping to the thing and enacting a sphere of force around them both, effectively cutting himself and the Galeb Duhr off from the surrounding conflict.

One elemental slams against the invisible barrier, smashing away with no results.

The red lightning cloud flashes angrily and the Elementals turn their attention away from the protected Galeb, focusing instead on the party and the other two crystal figures pulling themselves from the glowing spots of stone.

Feanon finds himself quickly surrounded out in the open, but enacts a Gravity well and Mirror image as he is swarmed by Cockatrice and angry elementals.

Patches manages to take down one of the enraged elementals, noting a red glow from within it as it crumbles, an uncut ruby losing its glow and tumbling to the ground.

The Drow notes that as the glow fades, a burst of red lightning arcs out and into the nearby stone.

Moments later, the stone in that area surges and another Elemental emerges into the battle.

Tark shadowsteps to the Galeb Duhr, intent to protect the creature emanating the Hallowing energies.

He and the crystal figure are rushed by an enraged elemental.

Gundren and Gwen meanwhile have been battling their own elemental, the thing attempting to grab Gundren and pull him into the stone…

Wrestling the thing, and with Gwen’s assistance, Gundren manages to avoid being dragged under at first, but quickly finds the thing to be inexorable and is pulled beneath a suddenly malleable cavern floor.

As all goes dark and he finds himself surrounded by liquid-like stone, Gundren enacts his powerful gauntlet and punches the Elemental point blank, the Chemical charge in the gauntlet housing detonating with a thunderclap.

The cavern floor where Gundren was pulled under, explodes upward like an underwater detonation, but as the rock and stone leaves the magical influence of the elemental, it re-hardens, showering the area with gravel, sand and larger rock shards.

Gundren scrambles from the pit, the elemental in pursuit, and grabs his rifle.  He spins and blasts the creature as it lunges, Gwen leaping on its back.

The first two shots shatter the “chest” of the vaguely humanoid thing, revealing a glowing uncut ruby.

His final shot, he destroys the ruby and a shower of red sparks and shattered gem cascades over the area.  No arc of lightning reaches out to touch the stone from this one and Gundren has an epiphany.

The Dwarf yells out over the din of the galeforce winds and rumbling of thunder - DESTROY THE GEMHEARTS!

As the Elementals begin to be destroyed, their gems shattered and the chaotic energies of The Bane being banished, the swirling entity of red lightning releases two more blasts and then dives into the nearby stone.

The blasts of lightning animate two more elementals that charge the nearest Galeb Duhr, trying to overwhelm Patches and Tarks defense of the creature.

The cavern begins to shake, and moments later, a massive elemental creature pulls itself from the stone of the cavern behind the Menhir and close to a point of the Galeb Durh triumvirate. 

Easily twenty feet tall, the humanoid elementa strides forward to smash the Crystal Galeb, red lighting flickering around its towering form.

Its massive stone fists come crashing down atop the Galeb, smashing and cracking the crystal creature.

Its legs shatter under the impacts and it falls, though it rights itself as best it can and continues its work to Hallow the area.

Feanon sees the assault from the massive elemental and unleashes a blinding Lightning Bolt directly into it. 

Alas, it proves ineffective and he watches as the energies are absorbed by the red lightning aura of the creature.

The behemoth smashes down again on the injured Galeb and smashes the creature completely, leaving only a soft glowing pile of crystalline rubble.

The enraged earth elementals let out a unified “howl”, sounding more like the crushing of rock and the Behemoth strides toward the next crystal creature.

This time however, Patches stands in its way.

The rogue rushes in to engage the thing, calling upon her blade to blur her form and shield her from harm.

She duels the thing, stalling it effectively, allowing the group to finish off their individual elementals.

The blue shield of the Hallow spell continues to expand and grow more powerful, everywhere it touches it dispels the desecration.

Tark leaps behind the behemoth and attacks just as Gundren begins to blast it with his Rifle.  

Feanon finishes disintegrating the attacking Cockatrice and turns his attention toward it as well.

With the combined effort of the group, they keep the massive elemental from attacking the other Galeb Duhr, giving the crystalline creatures the time they need to finish the Hallowing.

A flash of blue light washes over the entire cavern and every enraged elemental instantly crumbles to rubble.

As the massive behemoth begins to fall, the red lightning storm is shunted from the body and thrown across the cavern.

The group watches as the entity is pushed away and down the nearby tunnel, the red lighting illuminating the ranks of petrified Drow.

Breathing heavily and sweating from the effort, the group takes a moment to recuperate and reflect on the outcome of the battle.


As they take a rest, Gundren begins harvesting elemental motes from the dead creatures.

Feanon and Cirrus both look over the site of the battle and easily recognize that the Hallow spell was a success, indeed, the entire group can now sense the holy aura of the place.

As they rest, Tark and Patches are made aware of two large creatures down a tunnel some ways away and they head to investigate.

As they approach, they see two large Basilisks; massive lizards with eight legs, plated spines and a petrifying gaze.

They are consuming the corpse of a Cave Badger, the thing petrified and shattered with the Basilisks greedily consuming the pieces.

Tark and Patches hear snuffling from further down the tunnel and sneaking past the distracted Basilisks, they enter an old Svirfneblin chamber.

Almost blocking the way inside though, is another petrified Badger with 5 flesh and blood cubs all sniffing around it’s stony feet.

The group decides to save them and moments later both Basilisks lie dead, having been attacked by the rest of the party as a distraction and then ambushed from behind by Tark and Patches.

Tark drags an annoyed Cirrus toward the parent Badger to restore it to flesh and blood, despite the Warlock’s passive agressive comments…

Patches manages to rip out an intact Basilisk eye and put it in a jar, knowing it’s petrifying nature from her Drow training.

Cirrus and Tark return a few minutes later, the sounds of happy Badgers emanating from the tunnel behind them.

Cirrus rolls his eyes and begins to complain as the rest of the group decides to head south to deal with the Stone Priestess.

Cirrus says they’ve done their part and need to move on, but Patches points out that she has a directive from her goddess to confront this cursed Priestess of Lolth.

Cirrus reluctantly agrees and the group presses on, heading south, in the direction the red lightning cloud fled and toward the Drow statues.

They cautiously approach the small army of petrified Drow.

Not wanting to take any chances, or potentially leave enemies behind them, the group decides to move through the crowd methodically, maneuvering each statue into Cirrus’ bag of Devouring.

Sure enough, on the third statue, it grinds to life and tries to attack the party, only to be overpowered and forced into the bag.

They head through the crowd, one by one, and spend the next four hours methodically destroying the army of statues.

They clear their way toward two Svirfneblin statues, petrified fighters standing back to back amongst a cluster of ruined statues.

The young male seems to have tried the same trick as before, holding up a crystal to diffuse the petrifying gaze, though the crystal in his hand is gone.

The other deep gnome has strangely sharp features, a long nose, larger ears and teeth, giving her a rat-like feel.

The group is exhausted from moving several tonnes of statues.

As the group finishes devouring the Drow statues, they get eyes on the large chamber with the Fire beetles.

They see a grand edifice cut into the stone, a large mansion with a waterfall cascading from the front and two swooping staircases rise from the cavern floor to the edifice balcony.

Petrified Drow can be seen standing guard, motionless outside the grand Svirfneblin manor.

Patches bets everyone that’s where a stereotypically narcissistic priestess would be.

The group decides to camp out and take a short rest to recuperate and before heading back to town for a longer rest. 

While they do this, they maneuver the petrified Deep Gnomes into bags of holding to be returned to their people.
