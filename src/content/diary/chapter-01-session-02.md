The party returned to the Stonehill Inn after clearing the Redbrands from Tresendar Manor. Sildar took custody of Iarno while the group settled in to rest and discuss what they'd learned about the Black Spider.

## Buumi's Solo Mission

Their rest was short-lived. Buumi barged into the common room, incensed at having been left behind during the manor assault. As it turned out, he'd gone off on his own and rescued hostages from the upper levels of Tresendar Manor single-handedly. He was miffed, but his attention quickly turned to the +1 longsword Talon recovered from the hideout — he asked to wield it, and the party obliged.

## The Cat in the Inn

A gnome druid arrived at the inn, shapeshifted into a cat-person — Doctor Breakfast, though they wouldn't learn her name right away. She was looking for adventurers willing to travel to Thundertree to find a druid named Reidoth. JmJm and the cat druid hit it off immediately, and the group agreed to rest for the night before setting out.

## The Gift of Sharess

That night, JmJm was awoken by a mysterious woman who materialized in his room. She introduced herself as Sharess, goddess of hedonism and indulgence. Despite JmJm's insolence — or perhaps because of it — she gifted him the Tavern of Doors, a pocket dimension accessible through a magical door. Sharess left exasperated by the encounter.

The party explored the Tavern of Doors, discovering a magical harp in one of its rooms and a bottle of Wine of Charming. They promptly drank half the wine.

## Setting Out for Thundertree

The next morning, the party met again with the townmaster. They proclaimed their intention to search for Cragmaw Castle, where Gundren Rockseeker was being held, though no one knew its location. They also learned of the Temple of Secrets quest involving someone named Agatha, but decided to head for Thundertree first — the druid Reidoth might know the way to Cragmaw, and he was the same druid Doctor Breakfast was seeking.

Tark took off without waiting for the group, leaving the orc paladin and elf ranger behind. The rest managed to hitch a ride on the wagon and followed the road north.

## The Road North

The first day of travel was uneventful. The party set up camp for the night, ate outside, then retired into the Tavern of Doors. Patches and Fëanon climbed a tree with the ToD and settled in to keep watch.

Ghouls approached in the night, drawn by the dying campfire. The group nearly slipped away unnoticed, but when Patches mentioned the ghouls to Tark, the monk flew into a rage and charged out of the Tavern of Doors — forgetting he was twenty feet up in a tree. Patches caught him, but they both toppled out. Fëanon made his way down with the ToD and the group charged forth. The ghouls were easily dispatched with no injuries.

The next day they continued on with the wagon, which they'd hidden the night before along with the oxen inside the Tavern of Doors. They came across an ogre attempting to ambush travelers. Tark, ever the diplomat, tried to reason with it and offered it flowers. The ogre hesitated, but hunger won over curiosity and it attacked. Patches assassinated the creature as the group laid into it, and it fell quickly.

## Thundertree

The party arrived at Thundertree — a desolate town ravaged by volcanic eruptions thirty years prior. They explored the first few buildings and encountered twig blights. Doctor Breakfast attempted to communicate with them using her druidic abilities, but the creatures attacked regardless. They were easily dispatched, and the party looted the houses.

Scouts reported sighting a green dragon circling above the old mage's tower on the hill. The party pressed on and found Reidoth's house, where the druid warned them that confronting the dragon would be suicide.

## Venomfang's Trap

The group ignored Reidoth's warning and climbed the hill toward the tower, walking past a house draped in cobwebs. Patches wisely stealthed and shadowed the group from a distance.

Approaching the tower, the dragon appeared atop it and offered parlay. Venomfang proposed a deal — he would pay the party if they dealt with his "vile sister" in Neverwinter Wood. The party agreed and approached the entrance to examine a map to the other dragon's lair.

It was a trap. Venomfang unleashed his poison breath on the party clustered by the doorway. Everyone was hit except Patches. Tark was brought to the brink of death; everyone else was badly wounded. Buumi shielded the group while they grabbed the unconscious Tark and dove into the Tavern of Doors. JmJm quaffed an invisibility potion, grabbed the ToD, and ran like hell back to Reidoth's house.

## The Dragon's Hoard

Patches, still hidden, seized the opportunity. She snuck past the confused dragon and into the tower, thoroughly looting the hoard. Just as she was wrapping up, Venomfang returned and breathed down into the tower. Patches escaped by the skin of her teeth and stealthed her way back to Reidoth's hut, where the group had taken shelter — unbeknownst to Reidoth.

Doctor Breakfast healed Tark, and the group counted themselves lucky to be alive. The loot from the dragon's hoard was considerable: 200 gold pieces, four silver goblets set with moonstone worth 60 gold each, a scroll of Misty Step, a scroll of Lightning Bolt, the +1 axe Hew, and a Vial of Infinite Liquids.
