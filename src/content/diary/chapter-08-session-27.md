Uira the small, plump moon elf Acolyte welcomes the group as they enter the Teleportation chamber and then goes to fetch **Li Tan**

The group ascends from the temporary Teleportation chamber and arrives in the tower proper

Depictions of Fey'Anon's life, in grand engravings, ring the tower and follow the flow of the stairways up.

The group heads through a set of beautiful wooden doors, colored light shining on the marble floors from Stained glass windows, and into a large dining hall.

Gundren pours out the ewer of feasting and everyone partakes (except Claudine who is too nervous)

The group finishes and then return to the main hall to exit Fey's Tower into the evening, a full moon rising. 

It is a clear chill night with the tears of selune clearly visible, strong moonlight bathing the valley.

The group looks across the small island holding Fey's grand tower, the sides sweeping and twisting into the sky and still under construction.

Across from the tower entrance, not 300m away are a set of Dwarven docks, built from sturdy wood.

Past the docks, the group looks over the lake and can clearly see the Fane of Selune.

The Fane is grand, with an hourglass like shape and a similar twist to Fey's tower, except with thorn-like protrusions up its length.

While Fey's tower rises a good 150ft into the air, the Fane is shorter and squatter at around 100ft.

Claudine falls to her knees and begins to sob, overwhelmed by finally returning to the surface after a life of slavery.

Marzeline is in shock but drops to her mother's side and comforts her, holding her in her arms.

As the group scans the area, The Red hill on the edge of the Moonwood is clearly visible and the Dwarven mine is lit by torchlight.

They look south and see the sheer seamless walls of the keep of the Thunder Bluff constructed seamlessly of red hued stone reflecting the moonlight.

The Barony is bathed in a surreal glow from the full moon and the large, red-stoned smooth structures.

Li comes down from Fey's tower behind the group and greets them warmly.

She Introduces herself to Snorbul, Claudine and Marzeline.

Snorbul though is having a hard time dealing with sky, feeling as though he will simply fall into the great void above.

After pleasantries, Li takes the group across the lake, from Fey's tower to the Fane and it's Garden (via boat)

The Fane of Selune is nestled in the outer forest of the Moonwood, it's hourglass like shape ascending above the treetops from a clearing.

The Group heads into the Fane and instantly note a Wood Elf Shrine to Selune set up on altar beneath massive statue of Cirrus.

Honored, Cirrus investigates with Patches and notes the center of the shrine is made from a fallen meteorite, a "tear" of Selune.

As the group gazes upon the shrine, the Deep Gnome Topsy comes up to greet the group, meeting Patches first and then gives Snorbul a parasol to help with the sky.

They then head down the cobblestone road from the Fane to New Daggerford.

As the Forest thins out and opens into the plains of the valley, the Tradeway is clearly visible and a new large watchtower and gatehouse is on the Western road.

New Daggerford is still only a handful of smaller houses, though more are under construction.

The group heads into the center of town, to the two buildings that dominate the area: A massive Tavern connected via sky-bridge to a Theater.

Nearby villagers note the group and greet them with cheer, many are the freed slaves from Neverwinter and remember their saviors.

Doc B takes his leave, called away by a need to explore.

The rest of the group heads into **Over the Moon** - a large three story manor house made of brick and timber and functioning as the Tavern, Inn and Town Hall of New Daggerford (as well as the center of Patches operation; The Obsidian Order).

Inside the group is met by a scene of good cheer and although the main floor is massive and sparsely populated by customers, those that are there are clearly happy.

Patches heads over to the bar and the girl working behind it that she does not recognize, approaching as much for drinks as information.

Lilly Blackthumb introduces herself (daughter of the local Blacksmith).

She explains that she figured out Kitty was extra smart.

She Is young but wants to learn and after an earnest appeal, Patches hires her for real.

Everyone else starts to drink and chat

They quickly learn from the townsfolk that a kid is missing an Buumi is up the road at a town meeting in Kossenberg about it

JmJm hears of his own Theater construction and his reaction is as epected: "NO NO! IT'S ALL WRONG!" and storms out.

Finishing their drinks, the group heads out into the town center to discuss where to go next and Li takes her leave.

They decide to send a "note" to Veygar to have him leave Gracksuluth - via messenger box

Tark takes the super small-inating potion and gets mailed via instant-courier back to the Underdark.

The Box arrives at the destination and Tark instantly hears the sounds of conflict.

Tark opens the box to see a pitched interior battle between Veygar's crew and assaulting Stoneguard in some kind of basement.

Tark drops darkness over the whole chamber and activates his blindfold while warding off attacks.

He calls out to Veygar and the surprised Duergar calls back. 

Tark throws him the potion and Veygar drinks it just as an Enlarged Duergar tries to grapple him, but misses.

As Tark is trying to extricate Veygar, Veygar's crony realizes an escape is happening and tries to hitch a ride, trying to leap into the box but fails.

Tark sees Velka and Hemeth get captured by Stoneguard with large hooked cleavers and drag them into the press of bodies.

Tark picks up the teeny Veygar and closes the box lid, and with it being dismissed, returns to the caster; Cirrus.

The box appears in the crossroads in New Daggerford and the top opens, Tark exiting with Veygar

Veygar resumes normal size and tells group about the Stoneguard attack, that they were doing a job around the Palace.

He guesses that his new teammate, Brassifordt, betrayed him.  

As the group is chatting with Veygar about his information on the Artifact piece, the group sees Buumi coming down the street from the north.

Buumi is not alone and is with three others; Paladin trainees including his niece (Brigitta, daughter of Georg and Seska).

Buumi greets the group and then the Paladin trainees are sent on back to the keep for the night.

Buumi says hi to everyone properly (hugs etc.) and says he's ready to head with the group down to the Underdark, his family being as settled as they will ever be.

Returning to grilling Veygar, he is pressed by the group about whether he needs Velka to take them to the ruins in the Labyrinth.

He says she would help tremendously, but its not strictly "necessary", though Velka has much more information on the interior of the Ruins than he does.

He does tell the group his cousin, Velka and their friend Hemeth will most likely be executed as they were busted during a heist planning.

The group says they are sorry, but they don't have time to rescue Velka, Hemeth and Bassifordt.

Veygar looks a little shocked, but shrugs and says that sucks, but it is what it is.

Buumi is dismayed, but says nothing

Veygar heads off to drink away his sorrows and asks Patches one last time if she's serious that they won't help his kin and Hemeth.

Buumi tells the group about what he has been dealing with; a farm boy is missing.

The group decides to find the kid, or at least check in with the family and head north to the outskirts of the other small village

On the largest farm, a sizeable crowd of villagers is showing support for the family of the missing boys and search parties can be seen returning and reporting in

As the group approaches, the crowd goes quiet in respectful awe of the group.

The party discusses if they should personally handle this but decide not to, deciding they can delegate.

Buumi is shocked 

Buumi admonishes the group, pointing out that they had refused to save Veygar's crew as well and asks why they are acting this way.

Several of the group feel guilty and when Buumi states that he will look for the child himself, the group relents and decide to assist.

They enter the farm to check it out, see if anything can lead them to the kid

Thinking about scrying on him several head upstairs to search the kids room, a shared space by all the family save the parents.

Searching the area, they find a handful of copper and a blunt Iron knife under a floorboard beneath the kids bed.

In the rafters, a small window is open for ventilation, Patches hops up and notes something; claw marks.

Throwing down a rope, Gundren is hauled into the rafters to look at the claw marks himself and he confirms what they were all suspecting; Oni.

Tark grabs the kids scent and the group head out East, toward the river.

they find footprints after about 500m, the Oni touching down from its flight, which continue all the way to the shallow river heading out of the Moonwood

here the group figures it used the river to hide its tracks so Patches heads upstream while the others go downstream.

Patches quickly decides north is the wrong way and follows her gut, heading south and returning to the group.

They continue south for some time following the river south.

Tark uses his staff to fly and get a good lay of the land and notes a basin, a forested dale nestled within some rolling hills.

At the center is a clearing with flowing water and at the center of that, a massive standing stone.

The group recognize it as a hallowed area, a holy site that Fiends, undead and similar creatures cannot enter.

Fey points out that any creature possessed that is brought here would be freed of possession.

Patches starts, a solution to an issue resolving in her head: With her wish spell contained in her sword, she could wish Cercei here and free her from Corpsetaker...

Looking across the sunken grove Tark notes a harsh line between the lush stand of trees and wildflowers, and the rocky scree fallen from the sheer drop into the cul-de-sac.

Nestled amongst the rocky overhang, Tark spots movement from a deep shadow, a crack in the base of the stone cliff.

From a thin cave crawls a multi-armed Oni, covered in blood and skittering across the stone.

Held on it's back by a set of arms is a weeping human child

Tark immediately returns to the group, warns them and they rush to save the child under the cover of Pass without Trace.

As they go, Patches once again accidentally steps into the border Ethereal Plane.

While there, she sees the spirit of Theodemir who is surprised to see her there.

They discuss and decide that it is a turn of events to be explored at a later date and Patches returns to the prime material.

Just in time to see the group absolutely demolish the Oni.

Cirrus paralyzes it, Gundren point blank shoots it three times, Tark rescues the child and Fey'Anon calls a ghostly hand to rip out its soul.

The thing falls dead, a blasted mummified mess...
