The group found themselves no longer in Sha'Alazzi's tent but standing in what appeared to be the bottom floor of a tower. The room was octagonal — part entryway, part library, with bookshelves and reading desks arranged throughout. Ahead, a large staircase led up a level, but in front of it loomed two horned creatures. Seven feet tall, with pointed horns, elongated heads, and flickering tongues, the two bearded devils hefted their greatswords with supernatural ease.

## The Library Floor

The devils questioned the group's presence, but JmJm calmed their nerves with the soft strums of his harp. He charmed them, nearly convincing the pair to escort the group through the tower. One shook off the enchantment — but before it could attack, its charmed companion swung at it on JmJm's prompting. The swing missed so terribly that the blade cleaved an invisible imp in half purely by chance.

Doctor Breakfast noticed the strange air currents in the room and determined that several invisible imps were scattered throughout. The group, aided by the charmed devil, made short work of the uncharmed one, but four imps attacked from invisibility. The remaining devil shook off its charm just as a crossbow quarrel from Patches struck it in the back. One imp attacked Buumi, two flew for Doctor Breakfast, and the last went for JmJm — who had sprinted to the downed devil to tear free its skull as a trophy. Doctor Breakfast dispatched an imp with a scimitar beheading, Lothli shot another from the sky while her wolves tore apart a third, and Buumi took a stinger jab under the left eye, his faceplate preventing a worse wound.

JmJm, cornered, fired his hand crossbow point-blank into the bleeding devil's skull. The bolt lodged in bone and the creature swung wildly, cutting a line across JmJm's chest. Buumi closed the worst of the wound with healing magic as another of Lothli's arrows slammed into the devil's back. Patches rushed in and backstabbed the creature, letting The Reaver feed on its soul as it turned to dust. Gundren's lightning round dispatched the final imp.

They found three spell scrolls in the library: Unseen Servant, Mirror Image, and Lightning Bolt.

## The Steam Chamber

The next floor was a large empty room with three inches of water covering the floor. A brass pipe descended from the ceiling in the center, ending about six feet from the ground. Gundren discovered sigils on the floor beneath the water — one of rubies and one of sapphires — on opposite sides of the room. A mural depicted battling fire and water elementals turning to steam. Patches found a button near each glyph.

The group positioned themselves to lure the elementals toward the center pipe. When the buttons were pressed, fire erupted above the ruby glyph and the water coalesced into an elemental on the sapphire glyph. The group half-heartedly engaged both, taking minor hits while herding them toward the center. When the two behemoths collided beneath the pipe, they exploded into steam. The group dove clear — except JmJm, who caught a blast that burned his exposed skin. The steam filled a magical container and pressurized upward through the pipe, unlocking the door to the next floor.

## The Corpse

On the third floor, a simple hallway led to two doors and the stairs beyond. Patches crept through the left door into a dusty, long-abandoned guest room. In a four-poster bed behind closed drapes, she found a rotting woman's corpse strapped down with thick leather bindings. She quietly left and reported to the group.

Everyone agreed to leave the corpse alone — everyone except Gundren, who called them all wusses and kicked in the door. Patches locked it behind him. The corpse came to life, straining against the bindings and screaming. Gundren's thundercannon blasted it repeatedly, but strange worms inside the creature regenerated the damage as fast as it was dealt. The group unlocked the door and began firing crossbow bolts and arrows, but the missiles were pushed out almost the instant they penetrated. An eel-like worm vomited from the creature and slithered toward Buumi, trying to burrow through a seam in his armor. Lothli cut it free with her shortsword, and Buumi delivered a mighty radiant blow with his enchanted longsword. The holy damage burned the beast and killed its infesting worms. A second smite from Buumi and a final lightning blast from Gundren exploded the creature in a shower of giblets and burning worms.
