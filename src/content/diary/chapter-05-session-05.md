## Descending into the Valley

The group rested on the high road beyond the Tser chasm bridge. Tark appeared out of the mist, confused but otherwise himself — after a few seconds everything seemed normal and nobody remarked on his absence. Such was Barovia.

Ireena told them what to expect on the road ahead: massive unmanned gates dividing the valley in half. Patches scouted ahead, scaling a cliff for a better view, and confirmed the gates were a duplicate of the ones they had entered through. Beyond, the road descended into the valley proper. Castle Ravenloft loomed behind them up the mountainside. Ahead, shrouded in mist and drizzle, dark forest gave way to the town of Vallaki on the banks of a large lake, mountains rising steeply on the far shore.

Before the forest, on a small hill connected to the road by an unkempt winding path, stood an old windmill. The group knew what lived there.

## The Plan

Most of the group wanted to destroy the hags and free whatever children they held. Fëanon, however, wanted information first — specifically the location of Baba Lysaga. The plan was layered: Fëanon and Tark would enter the windmill, with Tark disguised as a child through hypnosis, offering a "gift" in exchange for knowledge. Patches would infiltrate from the roof. The rest of the group would hide outside, awaiting a signal. Mr. Pickles and Chekov were posted well behind some boulders with the tethered mounts.

Fëanon called out and Granny Morgantha opened the door with a smile, beckoning them inside. Patches scaled the exterior in her Drow piwafwi, silent as shadow, and entered the attic through a crack in the ceiling. There she found a dusty box containing a cache of precious gems, which she pocketed without hesitation. Moving to the ladder, she peered down to the next floor and saw two hideously ugly women in gowns of stitched flesh, jabbing caged children with long needles and cackling at the screams. Patches set her jaw and waited.

## Deception and Discovery

Below, Fëanon and Morgantha engaged in a tense conversation. The hag was delighted by the "gift" of a child but grew annoyed at the mage's demanding tone — even telepathically delivered, his imperious manner grated. She revealed that her mistress, Baba Lysaga, resided in a town Strahd had annihilated centuries ago, but refused to provide anything more specific. Silently, she summoned her daughters.

The two ugly women upstairs transformed into beautiful young ladies in silk gowns and descended to join their mother. The moment they left, Patches moved. She picked the cage locks in seconds, brought the children to the roof, and shot a web from her bracers to create a zipline to the ground. The first child slid down safely. The second fell halfway, dropping ten feet into the soft mud with a cry of surprise.

Everything happened at once. Fëanon turned to leave, grabbing the dazed Tark by the hand, but Morgantha seized his trailing arm. Fëanon warned the group telepathically. Then the falling child's cry reached the windmill and every eye in the room went wide. Fëanon slammed his magic into Morgantha's face, stunning her, and broke the spell on Tark. The monk spun and attacked the two hags descending the stairs.

## The Bonegrinder Burns

Gundren fired two phosphorus shells into the exterior wall. A ten-foot flaming hole erupted in the side of the windmill, and Gwen leapt through to rake at the hags with her mithril claws. Tark unleashed a flurry of blows. Ireena charged through the burning hole with both flintlock pistols and emptied them into Morgantha. Patches crept down the stairs behind the hags and began driving her blades into their backs.

Buumi, seeing every entrance blocked, decided to make his own door and charged the brittle wall beside the doorframe with an oath to Helm. He made it about halfway through and became thoroughly lodged. In frustration he hurled his hammer over the group, cracking one hag across the face and knocking out a tooth, which Fëanon promptly mage-handed into Patches' pocket.

Beset from all sides with their house burning and breaking around them, the hags turned ethereal one by one, but not before knocking over a barrel of foul oil from which sprang three Banderhobbs. Fëanon called for a retreat. Tark shadowstepped to the last supporting beam, smashed it, used the falling timber to launch himself clear, and knocked Buumi free from the wall on his way out. Gwen fired her magic missiles to shatter what remained of the structure, then loosed a lightning bolt through the ground floor. Patches dove from a second-storey window. With a groan of splitting wood, the entire windmill collapsed in a heap of flame.

## The Last Stand

Showered in splinters and coughing smoke, the group pulled themselves to their feet and formed a line. The rubble shifted and a battered Banderhobb clambered out — only to be shot by the entire group simultaneously. Gundren's thundercannon turned it into a wet pop.

The hags struck from the wreckage in their ethereal forms. Morgantha lined up the group and unleashed a cone of cold that dropped Fëanon and Gwen instantly, left Gerwan barely standing, and burned everyone else with horrible frost. The other two hags raked at the survivors with claws.

Patches circled the ruins and lobbed a flash grenade at two of the hags, blinding Morgantha. Buumi used Tark as a distraction while he rushed to Fëanon's side and poured healing into the fallen wizard. Ireena and Gundren, shaken but standing, destroyed one hag with a barrage of rapid shots. Tark shadowstepped behind Morgantha and snapped her neck with a vicious kick while Patches stabbed her cursed blade through the hag's ribs. The final daughter, seeing her mother and sister dead and the group already recovering, turned ethereal and fled for good.

The group stood before the burning wreckage of the Old Bonegrinder — battered, drained, but victorious. Behind them, the rescued children watched the flames consume the den of evil. Looking closely through the fire, the group thought they could see small childlike faces in the dancing flames, finally free.
