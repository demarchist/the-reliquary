The group collects the wounded Wererat and places him on the Tenser’s Disc summoned by Gundren.

Gundren manages to harvest some parts from the fast decaying Demons; A Barlgura Tusk and a good piece of Chasme Carapace.

They then have Boulda, the Wererat they rescued from Petrification,  take the lead, escorting them through the Warren to the “town” center.

The group notes the mess and smell of the place as well as the large number of regular rats scurrying about the place.

The group notes dozens of beady eyes watching them.  The ratlike eyes of the Deep Gnomes here reflecting flickering torchlight.

As the group moves through the Warrens, they see that almost all of the Wererats have gathered in the center of the town, gathering wagons and supplies as if to move.

The chamber of the central Warrens is massive and shows typical Svirfneblin architecture, though covered in a century of neglect and filth.

The plaza is full of a good seventy Deep Gnomes.

At the far end of the cavern is a balcony and out onto it steps a very fat Wererat Deep Gnome, a great moustache waxed into a magnificent set of whiskers.

Boulda leads the group forwards and the resident Wererats give them space, backing away and eying the group suspiciously.

The disposition of the Wererats though is not one of hostility.

The injured Wererat on the disc is taken by his kin and some approach Topsy and begin talking to her quietly, asking questions.

As the group arrives at the center of the plaza, in front of the balcony, the fat Wererat greets the party, and his daughter Boulda.

He says his name is Chipgrin and he thanks the group for their assistance in saving his child and kin.

The group asks if the Wererats will assist their Deep Gnome kin in the other section of the city.

The response is a bit frosty and the group learns that they were thinking it over.  They have suffered too many injuries recently due to the near constant attacks of the oozes. 

The group looks around and indeed, most of the Svirfneblin Wererats here show some form of burn or injury.

Being Wererats, they are VERY hard to kill, unfortunately, their gnomish connection to the Earth has weakened considerably and they no longer have access to divine or druidic magic.

Their Wererat nature is regenerating the worst of the damage from the Ooze attacks, but its very calorie intensive and they are running out of food.

The group promises equal treatment, Snorbul swearing on his honor that the Wererats will not be mistreated and convinces Chipgrin to come and meet with Chief Diggermattock in the main settlement of Blingdenstone.

The chief reluctantly agrees and they head back through the Warrerns to the main settlement.

Making good time, the group escorts the Wererat chief through the city, to the War table set up in the heart of Blingdenstone.

Chief Dorbo welcomes the group back and offers a curt greeting to the Wererat, the Deep Gnome chief wrinkling his nose a little at his counterpart.

The negotiations start off tense, but with the groups assistance, they realize quickly that they have far more in common than they do differences.

Before long, they agree that they can put aside their differences for at least as long as it takes to assist the group in clearing out the Oozes and their Master to the North.

The ooze-imposters are brought up by Gundren and Chipgrin remarks that they can sniff them out, they nipped that in the bud early.

The two chiefs shake on it and begin to organize their forces together.

Gundren talks to Gurnik about getting the Wererats proper healing and the Priest agrees wholeheartedly.

The cadre of acolytes, druids and priests of the Deep Gnomes then spend the rest of the day casting healing spells and attending to the flow of their Wererat kin from the northern Warren.

The group then goes with the Wererats to the local tavern to drink and have the Deep Gnomes and Wererats mingle and get to know one another.

As they move through the city, Snorbul notes a few of his kin giving the Wererats the stink eye and Snorbul gives them a more intense Stink Eye right back!

As they enter the tavern, one Deep Gnome sees the Wererats and gets up, spitting on the ground saying he no longer wants to be in the establishment and tries to shoulder past Snorbul and the Wererats.

Snorbul catches the man and hurls him ten feet across the room where he slams into a table.

Snorbul then hops up and makes it very clear: The Wererats are Kin, cursed from HELPING a traveler after surviving the destruction wrought by the Drow a century ago.  If any Deep Gnomes show the Wererats disrespect, they will need to answer to the new Wardens of Blingdesntone.

The mood takes a hit for a little while, but after twenty minutes of drinking, the Deep Gnomes and their Kin seem to be getting a long fine.

The group eats and drinks and enjoyes themselves before retiring to sleep and rest before the assault the next day.

That night, Feanon walks the city, looking for any signs of arcana.

Finding nothing, he ends up in Gurnik’s shrine and meets with the priest.

He asks if there were any great arcanists that once lived in Blingdenstone.

The priest does not know, but says he will ask one of his ancestors and summons a spirit easily.

They question the ancient Gnome and find out that yes, there was an Archmage of some renown: Archmage Carrowill.

They then summon the spirit of Carrowill.

Fey discovers that there is a powerful ritual located somewhere in Blingdenstone, the ritual to create the material Prismeum.

The crystal powder used in enchanting or to replicate spell ingredients.


The next morning, the group executes the plan they devized with Diggermattock and Chipgrin.

Tark, Snorbul and Patches head in from the North with the Cave Badgers and Trisks warriors nearby.

Gundren, Cirrus, Gwen, Feanon and Gurnik’s Priests and Druids will attack from the south and the main forces of the Gnomes will attack from the main gates in the middle, flanking the enemy force as they move south to attack the long-range characters.

Up North, Tark enacts Pass without Trace and they move in, spotting two Oozing Barlgura Demons patrolling the tunnels.

Patches feels a pull from her Celestial weapon and casts Etherealness on herself, stepping into the Ethereal Plane.

Down South, the attack begins as Gundren begins to shoot, Feanon casts a massive Lightning blast, Cirrus begins hurling Eldritch Blasts and the Gnomes summon a field of jagged and cutting crystals among the demons.

The area is thrown into a frenzy as hundreds of oozes and dozens of demons turn their attention to the south and rush in that direction.

As they smash into the erupting crystal field, the Southern group begins to cast spell after spell to hinder the enemy and assist themselves.

Gundren rings two of the Chardalyn bells, blessing his comrades before grabbing up his rifle again.

Gwen and Fea both let lose roaring blasts of lightning, burning away great swathes of Oozes.

Meanwhile, up north, Tark and Snorbul launch their attack on the Barlgura there, surprising the beasts and taking one down quickly.

The other manages to put up a decent fight and draws out the conflict with the Gnome and Barbarian as Patches is nowhere to be found…

Patches is in the Ethereal Plane.

Seeing the commotion and the glowing energy of the Demon battling the radiant souls of her friends, the Drow decides to use the Ethereal Plane to her advantage and scout ahead.

Floating through the misty representation of the Prime Material, she passes dozens of monsters through dark tunnels and quickly approaches the great stone Dome that dominates this section of the city, a place the Wererats jokingly called “The Pudding Court”.

It appears to be aptly named as the place is literally oozing with caustic jellies, puddings and oozes.  Demons are here in force and Patches spots many standing guard by the doors, while chasme demons nest of the ceiling inside the Domed structure.

Patches notes the main bulk of the forces here shifting to the south as the attack is launched in full and the Drow pushes forward, intent to see inside the Dome.

She floats in, past the Barlgura and enters the structure, the massive cathedral like chamber dwarfing the small elf.

Inside, she sees a powerful Demon, its soul burning brightly and before it, three of the oozelike imposters, though only one appears to be in a humanoid form.

The lesser oozes and demons all turn to the southern commotion, but the great Demon in the center of the chamber notices Patches, its power letting it see into the Ethereal Plane.

Dozens of faces ripple across the massive ooze and it turns toward the Drow who is already moving forward, quickly moving past the Greater Demon and down into a ramp that leads from the center of the chamber, down into a natural tunnel.

As she bypasses the Balor of Juiblex, it calls out in a warbling voice “noooOOOOoooo, the Master is not reaaaaaaaddyyyyyyyyy!”.  This call is audible far beyond the Dome, echoing as far as Tark and Snorbul.

Patches thinks that means now is the perfect time to pay it a visit, and books it down the tunnel as quickly as she is able, outpacing the oozing Demon far behind her.

As she rushes down the tunnel, it opens up ahead of her, a carved face of a svirfneblin man and woman flanking the cavern entrance, their eyes glittering with gemstones and crystal formations.

Patches moves into the chamber cautiously, seeing a circular tiered cavern of natural stone, though seeming to have an unnatural order to its layout.  This chamber, Entemoch’s Boon as Chipgrin called it, is the holiest site of the Deep Gnomes and a Gate to the Plane of Earth.

If there is a portal here, Patches cannot see it as the entire recessed floor is filled, like a great pool of Tar.

As patches watches, the massive pool ripples and pulses and rises up in a column, orbs of light moving up its body into a semblance of a head with many eyes.

The Great abyssal lord Juiblex shifts and moves, its amorphous body undulating with faces and limbs growing and forming and then merging back with the main mass.

Patches stares up in horror, facing a Demon Prince all alone, though in the current relative safety of the Ethereal Plane…
