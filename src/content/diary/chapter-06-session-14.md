## The Surrender

High Marshal Arasume's voice boomed across the plaza, informing the invaders that their leaders had abandoned them — literally flying to safety — and that they had no hope of winning. She noted, however, that the Amnian soldiers had largely shown restraint, adhering to orders not to kill civilians. Though many were wounded and several dead, it could have been worse. The troops would not be mistreated. They would be ransomed back to Amn and all debts between the nations ended.

Abdul rode forward to negotiate but quickly realised he would be lucky to survive the coming hours and backed down. General Omar was brought out of the main army with multiple stab wounds in his lower back — Abdul had apparently ordered his own men to kill the General in the confusion. Buumi rushed forward and healed the worst of Omar's wounds, getting the older man back on his feet.

The Senior Council began partitioning the army with walls of force. Most of the Amnians simply sat and waited, trusting Arasume's word. The Mythal Golems formed a bucket line, transporting soldiers in their massive arms into custody.

Disgusted by the attempted assassination of Omar, the group presented their findings to the High Marshal — the stolen documents from Von Issinger's desk, passed from Patches to Buumi to Cyrrus in a chain designed to keep the rogue out of official sight. Vigilant Master Thelm arrived from the Palace and confirmed that this was the group he had been hearing about.

Megno and his dwarves came over. Arasume expressed relief that he and his kin had survived and confirmed that Forgefather Ulric Halfhand and most of his dwarves in the Palace had made it through as well. Omar and the other Amnian nobles were taken into custody, with assurances from the High Marshal that Omar in particular would be treated well.

Arasume's helmet retracted, folding in on itself to reveal a High Elf with sharp features, black iridescent hair and softly glowing green eyes, a single scar splitting her lower lip. Patches hung back in the crowd, unwilling to reveal herself so brazenly — and quietly picked a few pockets while everyone was distracted.

## The Audience Chamber

The group accompanied the High Marshal, Thelm and the dwarves to the Palace, where the damage was sobering. Walls slagged, broken or blasted by powerful magic. Rubble strewn everywhere. Clerics attended the wounded while others were carried out. Inside the audience chamber, the Sundabarian dwarves had suffered — many cut down, blasted or turned to stone. Those who could be saved had been. The room itself was cracked open, a massive hole punching through all three floors. Apprentices prestidigitated blood and blast marks away while their masters telekinetically moved blocks of rubble back into place.

Gwen, damaged and leaking oil, was given a Silvarian crystal coin that summoned a Tenser's floating disc to spare her the walk. Old Ulric Halfhand came over — missing three fingers on his left hand and part of the palm — and was visibly relieved to see Megno and his lads had come through with minimal losses. The dwarves, including Gundren, retired to their ambassadorial suite to conduct their culture's death rituals: drinking deeply and telling stories of the fallen.

Arasume and Thelm reviewed the group's exploits and realised more was connected than anyone had suspected. The High Marshal, who had not yet read Thelm's report on Barovia, excused herself to do so. She arranged quarters for the group within the Palace and scheduled a meeting for the next morning.

## Tark's Dream

Exhausted, the group took breakfast in a grand dining hall with crystal chandeliers floating overhead and three stories of curving balconies. Buumi forgot the weight of his armour and crushed a chair on his first attempt. Talk turned to what came next. Tark was adamant — Damara and the return of Zhengyi were paramount. Cyrrus needed Neverwinter to find a warlock from his visions. Buumi needed to see his daughter. No consensus could be reached.

Then Tark felt a mental pressure — once, rebuffed. A second time, it slipped past his barriers. A Sending spell: his master had been saved. They would contact him tonight in a dream.

Cyrrus and Tark roomed together that night, the warlock keeping watch while the monk slept. A dreamscape formed: high in snowcapped mountains, a vast complex of terraces, pagodas and steep-roofed structures — the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in Damara. Tark descended stone steps to a meditation garden where Gaddock sat beneath a blossoming cherry tree, more colour in his cheeks than the last time they had spoken.

Tark threw himself upon his old master in a fierce embrace. Tears were shed. Gaddock explained that he had all but given up, languishing in a prison run by Zhengyi's followers, until a powerful monk from Kara-Tur named Kenshi and his disciples stormed the complex and freed everyone. Gaddock was still bedridden, unable to move in the real world, but alive and safe.

Tark wanted to leave for Damara immediately. Gaddock refused to allow it. He told his student that his skills were needed here — with his friends, doing important work. Zhengyi, backed by Orcus, was too strong to face alone. They would need allies. Tark reluctantly agreed to stay with the group, consoled by Gaddock's promise to keep in touch through dream spells and to teach him new techniques as Kenshi revealed them.

## The Council of Helm's Hold

The next morning, the group was led to the audience chamber where a circular table had been arranged. At its head sat Arasume — no longer in her seamless silver plate but in an elegant silver gown, a circlet of adamantite on her brow. Thelm sat to her right, and to her left the wizard Taern Hornblade of the Senior Council. Megno and Ulric Halfhand sat across the table.

Arasume began by rewarding the group for uncovering government traitors — one hundred platinum per head — and for their role in thwarting the Amnians and eliminating the Illithid threat. Their continuing efforts against the impending undead threat from Orcus, Zhengyi and their mysterious backer Atropos were also recognised.

For their service, the group was handed a writ of title and a land deed: the Barony of Thunder Bluff, seventy-five miles west along the Tradeway. Only one name could be placed on the writ. Cyrrus penned his, officially rising to the rank of Baronet — the lowest tier of nobility. Ecstatic, he illusioned what he imagined a baronet's hat to be: a large black top hat with red trim and silver bells dangling off the back. The dwarves offered their construction services as repayment for saving their delegation.

The discussion turned grave. Now that Arasume understood Barovia, Baldur's Gate and the artefacts, the full picture was deeply troubling. Events were spiralling and nobody had complete information. Taern expressed concern about the artefact's security. The dwarves offered the Vaults of Sundabar. Taern produced a small lead box from a bag of holding and floated it to Fëanon, who deposited the artefact within and placed the box in his own bag. Taern then penned a scroll of Instant Summons for Fëanon to learn — a final safeguard.

The consensus was clear: a council needed to be summoned. All the important players on the continent had to be made aware. Arasume called for the Council of Helm's Hold — in seventeen days, at the citadel thirty miles south of Neverwinter. There, everyone in attendance would share what they knew and a coordinated response could be mounted. The dwarves would sign their treaty with Silverymoon and send representatives separately. Megno expressed interest in attending personally. Ulric agreed.

## Planning and Shopping

Left alone with Megno, the group planned their next seventeen days. Megno would translate the mysterious Dwarven journal. The party would split: Megno, Gundren, Buumi and Patches would teleport to Sundabar — Gundren to repair Gwen, Megno to use his lab, Buumi and Patches to deposit their growing hoard in the Dwarven Vaults along with the artefact. Cyrrus, Fëanon and Tark would visit Thunder Bluff to inspect their new barony before meeting the others in Sundabar.

Megno gave Fëanon the teleportation rune for Sundabar with a warning not to share it — the Guild controlled such information jealously, and membership was anything but cheap.

For supplies, the group headed to Richter's Emporium of Items in the merchant quarter. Patches picked up a Ring of Warmth. Cyrrus got a scroll of Tiny Hut. Gundren selected another Bag of Holding — this one the height of Dwarven fashion. The price was excessive until the group offered the Mindslayer technology in trade, cutting the bill in half.

One last stop: the tailors. Cyrrus needed a baronet's outfit to match his illusory top hat. They found Telrin's Threads — and Cyrrus recognised the overweight, aging proprietor as the same tailor from Baldur's Gate they had tormented in the past. Telrin looked up and groaned. The group had their fun while Buumi cracked a smile despite feeling sorry for the man. Cyrrus commissioned a dark blue Elven-style baronet's robe with silver embroidery and a transmuted snow-leopard-skin sash. On the way out, Tark tripped on a bolt of silk and pulled down a shelf, triggering a chain reaction of mess that cascaded across the store. They left poor Telrin with the wreckage.

Outside, Buumi laughed but said he would pay extra for the trouble — Helm was just, and treating the man badly, although funny, was unjust. Fëanon made a remark about Helm in relation to genitalia and the group laughed. Buumi went red, activated his prosthetic and lifted the startled wizard thirty feet into the air. He set him down just as quickly, tearing up as he told them how the constant jokes about his faith hurt — that he could laugh too, but the unending torrent wore at him. The group fell silent, assured him it was all in good fun, and promised to show the respect his religion deserved. A still teary-eyed Buumi thanked them and headed down the street, the group close on his heels, returning to Richter's to collect their scroll before going their separate ways.
