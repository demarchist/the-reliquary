**The Plaza of the Watchers**

**​**The High Marshal turns and addresses the Amnian force, her voice magically amplified.

The Senior Council floats silently and eerily above the Amnian army, encircling it.

As moments pass, more and more of the Mythal Golems arrive, further surrounding the invaders.

The Amnians are looking suitably freaked out.

Paladins, clerics, druids and other healers rush around the square, healing and stabilizing.

The actual number of deaths is relatively small.

Arasume's voice booms across the square, informing the invaders that they have no hope of winning.

She informs the invading army that their leaders have abandoned them, literally flying to safety.

Arasume notes though that the Amnians acted with restraint, apparently adhering to their orders not to kill civilians.

Obviously many are wounded and several are dead, but it could have been much worse and the High Marshal recognizes this.

They won't be treated poorly, they will be ransomed back to Amn and all debts between the nations will be ended.

Abdul rides forward to try and negotiate, but quickly realizes he will be lucky just to survive the coming hours and backs down quickly.

General Omar is nowhere to be seen at first, but after a few minutes he is brought out of the main army with multiple stab wounds in his lower back.

He believes Abdul had his own men try and kill him in the confusion of the battle, but he survived.  

Buumi rushes forward to heal the worst of Omar's wounds and gets the older man back on his own feet.

The Senior council begins enacting walls of force to partition the army into manageable sizes.

Most of the Amnians simply sit, waiting, trusting the High Marshal to keep her word.

Golems begin a "bucket" line, transporting the Amnian soldiers in their massive arms, into custody.

Disgusted by the attempted assassination of Omar, the group interjects, presenting their findings to Arasume.

With a hand off of the incriminating evidence to Buumi, and then Cirrus, the documents Patches stole the night before are handed over.

Arasume listens and when Vigilant Master Thelm arrives from the Palace, he confirms her suspicions that this is the group she has been hearing about.

Megno and his Dwarves head over to the group, Arasume remarks that she is glad he and his kin survived and that Forgefather Ulric Halfhand and most of his Dwarves survived in the Palace.

Omar and the other Amnian nobles are taken into custody, but their comfort, especially Omar's is assured by Arasume.

The group gathers around the High Marshal, Megno and Thelm 

Arasume's Helmet retracts, folding in on itself and revealing a High Elf with sharp features, black Iridescent hair and softly glowing green eyes. A single scar splits her delicate lower lip.

All save for Patches, who hangs back in the crowd, unwilling to so brazenly reveal herself.

As the group chats, Patches eyes the crowd, looking for valuables and picks a few pockets.

As the crowd begins to disperse, a rich woman on the outskirts catches Patches eye and she manages to get a finger on the womans gemstone ring, stealing some of it's luster.

One of the Senior Council, an Archmage the High Marshal refers to as "The Watcher", floats in close.

He says nothing, but acknowledges the group.

The group, VIP's and Dwarves all begin heading toward the Palace, discussing the recent events as they go.

Patches shadows the group at a safe distance, keeping an eye out for anything.

Megno laments the loss of some of his kin, but is proud of how his men handled themselves and happy that Silverymoon citizens leaped to their defense.  

He strongly believes in the upcoming treaty now.

Despite his wounds and the days events, he is excited to take a look at the mysterious Book the group has for him.

**The Palace and the Aftermath**

**​**Arriving at the palace, the group sees the damage first hand.

Several walls have been slagged, broken or blasted by powerful spells.

Rubble is strewn everywhere.

It's a bustle of activity as guards rush to and fro, with clerics attending to the wounded and still others being carried out of the area.

The group heads up the steps, following the High Marshal.

Seeing the group heading inside, Patches catches up and heads in with them.

Inside, the group heads into the Audience Chamber and see the location of the battle with Shaahir and his strongest warriors.

The contingent of Sundabarian Dwarves suffered casualties, with many having been cut down, blasted or even turned to stone.

Those that could be revived and saved, were.

The room itself is blasted and cracked, a large hole going through all three floors of the palace, with further structural collapse surrounding the damage.

The group sees acolytes and apprentices rushing around, prestidigitating blood and blast marks away while their masters telekenetically move the largest blocks of rubble back into place to be mended.

Arasume stops and the group stops with her, forming a small clump in the middle of the chamber.

Gwen, damaged and shaking, begins to leak oil on the marble floor.

Exasperated at the state of his clockwork companion, Gundren asks a servant for a cart so she doesn't need to walk.

The servant returns with a Silvarian "cart" a Crystal Coin that summons a Tenser's floating disc.

An old Dwarf with blood in his beard heads over; Ulric Halfhand.

Missing three fingers on his left hand and part of that palm, his last name is obvious to all who have seen him.

The Venerable Dwarf is instantly relieved to see that Megno and his lads had come through with minimal losses, he had feared the worst.

Megno tells Ulric of the bravery of the Silvarians and the Dwarves as a group begin singing their praises.

With dead to be honored and wounds to tend to, the Dwarves (including Gundren) all retire to their ambassadorial suite to conduct their culture's death rituals. (lots of drinking and telling stories of the dead).

The High Marshal and Thelm go over the groups deeds as of late and realize that more might be connected than they think.

Arasume, who had not read Thelm's report on Barovia, now thinks that she has some reading to do and excuses herself with Thelm to go and do just that.

She arranges for quarters for the group within the palace and organizes a meeting for the next morning.

**Taking a Looooong Rest**

Exhausted from all the running around the night before and the mornings battle, the group decides that a large breakfast is in order and catch the eye of one of the palace Valets.

The servant leads the group away from the wing with the destruction and damage.

Down elegantly flowing, white marble hallways, he takes them to a large dining hall.  The group sits at one of the corner tables, admiring the crystal chandeliers simply floating overhead.

The dining hall seems to be constructed almost like a courtyard, with a ceiling high overhead and three stories of gracefully curving balconies ringing the space.  The walls gleam with embedded silver.

The group flops into chairs, Buumi forgetting his armored weight and crushing a chair with his first try.

He doffs his armor and tries again, more successfully the second time.

Sitting in a beautiful marble palace, but covered in sweat, blood and soot, the group begins ordering food and drink.  The service is fast and before long the group is pleasantly stuffed and conversation turns to plans of the future.

Tark is adamant that the next steps need to be Damara and that the return of Zhengyi is paramount.

Unsure, the group debates it but can make no headway with the monk.

Cirrus remarks that he *needs* to go to Neverwinter to find a Warlock from his visions.

Buumi remarks that he needs to see his daughter and other family members.

The rest of the group has things they want to do, but nothing as urgent as Tark.

With tensions and uncertainty rising, the group continues to discuss.

Tark feels a mental pressure and wills it away.

Then he feels it again, this time it manages to get past his mental barriers.

A message floats into Tarks mind, a casting of the Sending Spell telling him that his master has been saved and that they will contact Tark tonight in a dream.

Confused and excited, Tark leaps to his feet and tells the group what he just heard and asks what it could mean?

Unsure, the group desperately wanting to find out, they beckon over a Valet to show them to their rooms.

Patches tells one of the Servants to allow Mr. Pickles into the palace and to have the mounts stabled.

The group retires to their rooms, bandaging, cleaning themselves and generally relaxing.

Patches takes the opportunity to make some more bombs while Mr. Pickles shows up to her room and brews her some tea.

Fey studies the spellbooks in his possession, deciphering some new information and receiving inspiration from the memories imparted to him by Theodemir.

Cirrus and Tark room together for the night, Tark wanting the Warlock to be close by while he dreams the planned meeting.

As Cirrus does not sleep anyway, this is fine for him and the Warlock watches over his Halfling friend while he sleeps.

As Tark sleeps, a Dreamscape comes into being around him.

High in snowcapped mountains a huge complex of terraces, pagodas and steep-roofed structures extend out before him.

He recognizes the place from his time as a child; **The Monastery of the Yellow Rose**, in Damara.

Looking around, Tark sees that he is in an open air shrine, Incense burning all around him.

He sees a set of stairs nearby that lead down to a meditation garden and descends the steps.

There in the garden, at the base of a blossoming cherry tree sits Gaddock.

Not nearly as decrepit looking, with more color in his cheeks. 

Tark yells in excitement and rushes to his old Master, throwing himself upon him in a hug.

Tears are shed and Tark recounts everything that's happened since they last talked.

Gaddock listens attentively and then let's his young student know his own story.

Near death, he had all but given up on life, languishing in a prison run by followers of Zhengyi.

Then, a powerful monk from Kara-Tur named **Kenshi**, and his disciples, stormed the complex.

The party rescued Gaddock and freed all the other prisoners.

He is still weak and unable to move in the real world, Gaddock is bedridden but knows not where.

Tark feels that he should head to Damara as soon as possible to reunite with his master.

Hearing what Tark had just recounted though, Gaddock does not agree. 

He feels that Tark's skills are best used by staying with his group, that they are doing important work.

Gaddock also fears that they will need allies, that Zhengyi is too strong to be defeated when backed by Orcus.

Tark finally agrees to stay with his friends and is relieved to hear that Gaddock will stay in touch via Dream spells. 

Gaddock comments that he will be teaching Tark a few new tricks once Kenshi reveals them to him..

Tark sleeps the rest of the night away and awakes in the morning, well rested.

Gundren, off with the other Dwarves, awakes in the morning. 

Seeing his kin fast asleep still, Gundren heads out into the hall and finds a servant.

He is led by a Valet to the group's rooms.

In his room, Tark excitedly begins to relay everything he had found out.

Loud enough to wake his companions in the adjacent rooms, the group shows up not long after Tark begins his story and they are all caught up quickly.

With the pressing need to visit Damara somewhat abated, the group decides to grab some breakfast and meet with The High Marshal before making any more decisions for the future.

**Breakfast and Just Desserts**

**​**Heading out of their rooms, they are greeted by a servant and informed that Arasume will be waiting for them in the Audience Chamber after breakfast.

The group heads down to the dining hall for breakfast.

Not alone this time, a group of the Silvarian Court looks on with curiosity at the group of adventurers eating in "their" dining hall.

Buumi tries to act dignified and Courtly, but is laughed at by his friends until he just drops it with a sigh.

The group finishes up their food and head through the palace and into the Audience chamber

A circular table has been set up for everyone to sit at.

At it's head sits the High Marshal, no longer wearing her elegant, seamless silver plate armor and instead sitting at the table in an elegant silver gown, with a circlet of Adamantine atop her brow.

To her right sits Thelm and to her left a human wizard unrecognized by most of the group.

Fey recognizes the human as Taern Hornblade, one of the members of the Senior Council.

Across the table sits Megno and Ulric Halfhand of Sundabar.

The meeting starts off on a high note, with the group being rewarded for uncovering several traitors in the government and being awarded 100 platinum per "head".

Then she rewards the group for doing so much to thwart the Amnians and dealing with the Illithid threat.

 Their continuing efforts to safeguard against what appears to be an impending Undead threat from Orcus, Zhengyi and their mysterious backer; Atropos, is also recognized.

For their efforts, the group is handed a writ of Title and a land Deed for the Barony of Thunder Bluff, seventy five miles west along The Trade Way.

with only one name being possible to place on the Writ, Cirrus pens his name, officially rising to the class of Baronett Nobility (the lowest rank).

Ecstatic, Cirrus illusions what he imagines a Baronettes hat to be - a Large black top-hat with a red trim and silver bells dangling off the back. 

The Dwarves offer their services to the group for any construction they intend as repayment for their actions in saving the delegation and bringing the two nations closer together.

The discussion then turns to everything that has been happening.

Now knowing what happened in Barovia and Baldur's Gate and about the artifacts that have been recovered thus far, all those at the table are deeply concerned. 

Events seem to be spiraling and no one has the full picture.

Taern expresses concern about the security of The Artifact and the group agrees after some debate.

The Dwarves remark that the Vaults of Sundabar can secure the Artifact.

The group debates for a while, but agree that a trip to Sundabar would be prudent.

Just in case of divination magic and spying, Taern pulls a small lead box from a bag of holding and floats it over to Fey, who deposits the Artifact within and then puts the box in his bag of holding.

Concerned about the vault still, Taern quickly pens a spell scroll of Instant Summons for Fey to learn. 

The meeting decides that a Council needs to be summoned, that all the important players of the continent need to be made aware of what's happening.

Arasume calls for **The Council of Helm's Hold**.

**In 17 days**, all those who can be mustered will meet at Helm's Hold, a citadel thirty miles south of Neverwinter City.

There, everyone in attendance will be made aware of the world's events and hopefully more knowledge will come to light.

The Dwarves still intend to sign their treaty with Silverymoon, but will send representatives to the Council.

Megno expresses an interest in attending as it seems he has already been wrapped up in the events.  Ulric agrees.

The meeting ends and the Silvarians depart with Ulric.  Megno stays.

**Planning for the Future**

**​**The group is left sitting at the meeting table alone, save for Megno.

Talk quickly turns to plans for the immediate future as it appears they have 17 days before needing to be somewhere.

Megno excitedly mentions the Dwarven Journal he is supposed to translate and is handed it by Fey'Anon.

The group talks for a while, and ultimately decide to split the party.

The plan is to go to Helm's Hold in 17 days, leaving from Neverwinter.  To get to Neverwinter though, it is decided that they will teleport to Sundabar and then take the Dwarven gate.

They get permission from Megno, or at least assurances that he can get them permission to travel to Gauntlgrym which is less than a day away from Neverwinter.

Megno, Gundren, Buumi and Patches all decide to head directly to Sundabar, being teleported there by Fey'Anon.

Gundren needs to repair Gwen, and only the best facilities will do.

Megno needs his lab to decipher the ancient Dwarven Text.

Buumi and Patches will head to the Dwarven Vaults and deposit their treasure as it's beginning to get excessive.

Leaving the artifact in the Vault is also planned though there is some debate about when to do this.

Eventually it's decided that it should all be done at once.

Megno gives Fey the Teleport rune for Sundabar, but mentions to him not to tell anyone as The Guild would be mad. They strictly control the Runes.

inquiring, it's made clear that a network of Teleportation Circles exists, but the information is tightly controlled by the Mages of the world and membership is NOT cheap.

Though most major cities (if not all) have Circles, not every Rune is known to everyone and some cities outright treat their Runes as state secrets.

Buying runes is very possible, but the cost is high.

Cirrus, Fey and Tark decide to head to Thunder Bluff and check out the Barony they were just awarded and meet the group in Sundabar, teleporting from the wilderness.

The group decides that there's a few items necessary before splitting up and head out to procure them.

**Shopping**

**​**Heading to the Merchant Quarter, the group enters the winding streets of shops and stalls, meandering until they find what they are looking for: R.E.I - Richter's Emporium of Items

Heading into the large shop, the group greets the Enchanter, Richter.

Looking around the shop, the group inquires and quickly finds what they are looking for.

Patches picks up a ring of Warmth.

Cirrus gets a scroll of Tiny Hut.

Gundren picks up another Bag of Holding, this one the height of Dwarven fashion.

Putting all the items on the counter, the price is excessive.

The group haggles and offers Richter a trade, giving him all of the Mindslayer tech (of which Richter is a HUGE fan), and the price is cut in half.

Richter sends his apprentice, Dell, out to a friend's store for the Spell Scroll he doesn't have.

Exiting the store, Cirrus asks for one more important stop - The Tailors, so he can have a Baronettes outfit made to match his illusionary Top-hat.

The group heads up the street until they find a sufficiently fancy looking tailor's shop, and one that appears to be knew in the city to boot; Telrin's Threads.

Cirrus enters the shop and sees an overweight, aging man bent over the countertop, handling fabric swatches.  He recognizes the tailor.

In a flash of remembrance, Cirrus notes that the Tailor is the same man from Baldur's Gate that they had annoyed in the past.

Cirrus turns to the group outside and with a grin, beckons them inside the shop.

Inside the shop the Tailor, Telrin, looks up and audibly groans as he remembers the group.

The group has fun tormenting the Tailor, and even Buumi cracks a smile despite feeling bad for the man.

They end up purchasing a dark blue Elven-style Baronette robe for Cirrus, with silver embroidery and a Snow-leopard-skin (transmuted, not real) sash.

The group thanks and pays the tailor, intending to return when the garment is finished.

As the group leaves the shop, Tark trips on a bolt of Silk, pulling down a shelf, which swings into a nearby display, causing a chain reaction of mess that cascades across the store.

They leave poor Telrin with the mess.

Outside, Buumi laughs, but says he will pay the man extra for his trouble. The group asks why? and Buumi responds that Helm is just and treating the man badly, although funny, is un-just.

Fey makes a remark about Helm in regards to Genitalia and the group laughs.  Buumi however goes red faced, activates his prosthetic and grabs Fey, lifting him 30ft into the air.

Buumi quickly calms and returns Fey to the ground, the surprised group looking on and then questioning Buumi.

Buumi, tearing up, exclaims how he hears the chuckling and the disrespect uttered at his religion and way of life.

Although at times, he finds it funny too, the unending torrent hurts him.

The emotional outburst stuns the group and they assure Buumi that it's all in good fun, but they will try and show the respect his religion deserves.

A still teary-eyed Buumi thanks them and heads down the street, the group close on his heels.

They head back to R.E.I to pick up their Scroll and plan to have the group go their separate ways, off to do their respective tasks...
