The group finds themselves in the bottom of the crater once occupied by the Illithid hive.  No snow falls, but the wind is biting this high up in the mountains and the sun is getting low on the horizon. 

Fey breaks down in tears, finally free of the whispers of the Illithid hive after fifty years (150 counting Barovia?).  Tark and Buumi console him, even Patches seems moved

Group looks for shelter, finds several possibilities.

Patches spots a patch of "snow" nearby in the bottom of the crater.  Investigates it to find that it's a pile of bones, the dumping ground for the Illithids.  She searches the pile, finding a lot of jewelry (wedding rings, earrings etc. 750g) with the gemstones removed.  She also finds an Archmage Brooch from silverymoon.

The rest of the group finds a small cave among the rubble and makes camp, setting a fire in a natural chimney.

As the rocks and debris have finally settled, the group hears the wails of the wounded and dying - the Amnian force that was in the area.

The group stays to make camp as Patches scales the sheer Crater walls for a better look. 

She reaches the top just in time to see a wounded Amnian come to the edge of the crater and look dazedly in, apparently not seeing the soft glow of the campfire beneath him.

As Patches scouts, Cirrus' Owl flies overhead.

Patches heads in far enough to see the disturbance in the dimming winter sunlight - a field of blood and corpses.  From the air, the Owl sees a slight pattern, as if the Illithid sentry golems had sprung out of the earth. 

All but 30 or so of the Amnian force of 200 has been slaughtered.  The survivors are attempting to consolidate and tend to their wounded.

Patches rushes back to inform the group. And finds them already making plans. Gundren stays behind with Alura, The Mindslayers, Gwen and Fey while everyone else decides to go and help the Amnians.

Cirrus and Buumi float to the top of the crater using levitation, while Patches scales the side with her climbing and Tark simply leaps twice, making it barely to the top and startling the concussed Amnian.

The group convinces the wounded man that he needs help and Buumi heals his head wound.  The now clear-headed man realizes who the group is and becomes far more reluctant to engage.

The group pressures the man into taking them to his comrades and the fact they healed him convinces the Amnian and he leads them to one batch of survivors.

Walking through the blood, the group makes it to the larger batch of men and talk with the General there - Captain Omar, an older man in his fifties with a huge bristly grey mustache, serious dark eyes and rich armor - a white turban and gold helm.  He is astride a warhorse.

The group make a deal with the distraught man, offering to help heal as many of his men as they are able.

Cirrus and Buumi begin making rounds, finding the most severe of the injuries and healing them enough to save the wounded.

Tark, Patches and Gwen grab a small sled, cast out all the crossbow bolts and begin going around collecting injured from the battlefield, saving many lives.

Patches spots the wounded, steering the cart while Tark stabilizes the wounded.  Patches finds several intact healing potions from the dead and they use a few to save the living (and pocket a few more).

Exhausted and the cries of the wounded becoming the silence of the dead, the group reconvenes with Omar - who is saddened, but immensely grateful for the lives that were saved.  Meanwhile, the healthy men had set up a winter camp as the sun was setting.

Omar remarks that he and his men were not prepared for this engagement, he does not seem to blame the group, so much as his commanding officer.

Just then, two horses gallop over from another batch of survivors - Abdul Al Suyuuk and a cloaked wizard that none of the group recognize (Leigham Al Suyuuk).

Abdul recognizes the group and fumes, blaming them for this disaster.  He is about to order an attack when Omar and the Wizard step in close and apparently talk him out of it (in Amnian).

Red faced, Abdul turns his horse and gallops back to his personal guard, the Wizard in close pursuit.

Omar apologizes and thanks the group before demanding they leave, so as not to further anger his superior.  The group heads out but not before Omar tosses a small ring to Cirrus as a token of his gratitude.

Patches stays up top, stalking Abdul back to his camp. She watches the Amnian politician and his Wizard - who she overhears being called Leigham - talk, but cannot make out anything except the name of the robed Wizard.  

Feeling the cold beginning to bite at her, Patches sneaks over to Abdul's horse, steals the contents of his saddlebags - 25 pp and a VERY nice set of rations - and makes her way back to the group's camp

 Back at camp, the group relays what had happened to the others and they settle in for the evening.  Patches hands Abdul's fancy rations to Fey to make him feel better. 

Thinking over the events of the day, the group heads to sleep.

  The next morning, the group packs up their camp and leaves the crater, finding that the Amnians had left even earlier.

While walking, Tark opens his bag of holding to inspect the new Artifact fragment the group had recieved.  As the bag opens, Tark feels a charge of energy build around him and twenty feet behind on the path, Buumi acts as if he is shoved forwards, toward the Halfling.  Tark closes the bag quickly and eyes Buumi suspiciously.

After a half day of uneventful travel and sledding using Buumi's shield.  The group, using the packed snow as a road from the Amnians passage ,  makes it back to the village of Gashaus.   Where they had met the daughter of Abner: Marian.

Barging into the inn, the group found the fiery young woman passed out from drink.  Fey takes her upstairs to make her comfortable while the rest of the party begins setting up for the night - making food and the like.

The party reunites with their mounts and Mr. Pickles.

The next day, Marian wakes to find her inn filled with adventurers.  Grumpily, she makes breakfast.  The mindslayers and Alura decide to stay in Gashaus village until the snow melts a little more, helping Marian and the villagers.  The group agrees and decides to push on back to Silverymoon themselves.

Having a thought, Cirrus and Fey attempt to contact Megno with a dream vision and luckily, the Dwarf is still asleep.

Fey tells Megno that Nostalgia is gone and the Dwarf is truly happy that his friend appears to be free of their influence.  Fey then relays to Megno about the Dwarf adventurer's journal and that the group needs a translation of Old Delzoun - a language Megno has been recently studying.  

Megno enthusiastically agrees, wanting to read the book and tells the group he will meet them in Silverymoon in a week as he was already planning on heading there for some treaty negotiations.

The spell ends and Fey relays the dream to the group.

Mr. Pickles brews some tea for Patches and reveals a pouch of Orcish Rudgrub Hash that he had found in the pantry.  Patches takes the Hash to sell later.

Fascinated by the tea ritual and curious, Fey asks for some tea and thoroughly enjoys his cup of Green tea to go with the wine and smoked meats Patches gave him.

Fey asks Patches about her training and Patches reveals that she was trained in combat by her brother - the Weapons Master of her noble house.  At the age of 20, she was then sent to train as a cleric of Lolth.

The group finds this fascinating and even gets a tid bit about Patches time in a BG circus (to catch a target) where she learned knife throwing.  Tark grabs an apple and asks for a demonstration.

Patches hits the apple perfectly, slicing it in half  and Buumi missed with his hammer, smashing a hole in the wall.  The mind slayers sigh and get to work patching the hole.

After a lazy morning, the group decides to go and try to find the glider they came in on, heading down the mountain to look for it.  A half mile from town, the group manages to combine their memories of the night and find the general location of the Glider, but it's nowhere to be found.

Covered from recent snow fall, the group narrows down the area and begins to dig.

Having no luck, Fey summons a massive construct of a hand and begins sweeping the snow aside.  Just before the spell ends, the top of the glider is found.

The group spends the next few hours uncovering and de-frosting the Glider above the tree line, high up on the mountainside.

Fey has a thought however and tries to open the door, straining against the "ice".  Until cirrus unlocks the door and it opens easily.

meanwhile, Gundren takes several of his shells and blackpowder and creates a large fire-work rocket, strapping it to the craft.

Inside, fey finds a piece of purple chalk that he had forgotten in the craft and spends the next several minutes sketching out a teleportation circle to get them back to Silverymoon even faster.

Activating the circle...nothing happens.  Confused, Fey starts over...with the same result.  Studying the runes of his circle and meditating on the magical emanations of his malfunctioning spell, he determines that the issue is not on his end, but on Silverymoon's - The Mythal is active and disrupting teleportation in and out of the city.

Alarmed, he informs the group and they decide to make use of the glider to get back to the city quickly.

the group get's into position in and around the glider. Gundren takes the pilot seat, with Fey as co-pilot.  Patches, Cirrus, Mr. Pickles and the cats are in back while Buumi and Tark are on the outside to give the Glider a push.

They push, and begin running with the glider, picking up speed.  

No longer able to keep up, Buumi hops inside and Tark hops on top of the glider (content to hang on...).

Buumi takes his seat with Patches and the pilots steer the craft steadily to a cliff.

Picking up speed on the snowy slope, the craft launches off the cliff and begins a lazy glide out into the valley.

Giving the stick to Fey, Gundren runs back and ignites his rocket, launching the glider higher (Tark screaming from on top as the craft shakes at high-speed).

The rocket shakes free and careens off, exploding on the mountainside and causing a small avalanche.

The glider makes it a good twenty miles before it finally has to be brought in for a landing.

Fey at the stick, he aims for a pathway of cleared trees - the snow covered Tradesway road between Sundabar and Silverymoon acting as a runway.

Ten feet above the ground, one wing clips a tree and is ripped off, sending Tark flying into the soft snow below and the glider crashing down the last few feet.

The mangled craft comes to a halt, many of the party thrown from the craft into soft snow.  Tark looks up from far behind the wrecked craft, waving at the group before slumping back into the cold, white powder.

Thrilled at the flight and descent, the group all comes together, fierce grins on their faces and laughing at the ridiculousness of everything.

The sun goes behind the mountains, setting quickly and the cold of night begins to creep in.  Looking around at the terrain, Gundren notes the river here is oddly clear of ice and spots a small heated stream flowing into the river downstream. 

Wading through the deep snow, the group makes it to the point in the river where the two bodies of water meet up and easily spot the hot-spring fed stream ascending into the hills.

Using Gwen as an anchor, the mechanical lion leaps across the river and the group uses a rope tied to a tree to shimmy across the cold waters without incident.

Now on the same side of the river as the heated waters, the group decides to follow them to their source, hoping to spend the night at some relaxing hot-springs.

Patches takes point when suddenly everyone hears a splashing from up on ahead.

Sneaking in, Patches makes it out of the snow and into a de-frosted area around a large heated pool.  

The blue, steaming waters have an ice waterfall trickling in at the back, moderating the temperature of the volcanic spring...and a young red dragon lounging in the pool.

Patches freezes behind a tree and rockie talkies to the group, relaying the dragon information.  The dragon hears the whispers and begins calling out to the person it knows is out there.

The group, hearing this somewhat "friendly" sounding call decides that they've fought worse, and really want to see a live Red Dragon and walk into view.

The dragon looks around in surprise before lounging back into the pool, seemingly confident.  She introduces herself as Vaelstraza, a migrating Young Red, looking to make her home in Gauntlgrym after hearing the call of the Fire Primordial there - The Dawn Titan Magaera.

Not wishing to disuade the dragon, the group engages in conversation.  Tark eventually gets comfortable enough to dive in (and get a little burned!) and swim with her and Patches come out from behind a tree once she realizes the dragon won't attack.

Beginning to lounge and set up camp for the evening, thoughts turn to food, the dragon casually mentioning eating one or two of them.

Chuckling (because everyone there knew the Dragon would die...) the group offers dinner and Patches heads out into the night to try and find a nearby herd of Elk the Dragon heard pass by earlier.

Easily finding the tracks and droppings, Patches sneaks up to a small herd of Elk, sliding across the surface of the frozen snow. She finds two large specimen and quietly cuts their throats while they sleep. The herd is startled on the second cut as the scent of blood fills the air from the first and the rest of the herd bolts.

Patches begins field dressing the kills and calls back to Buumi with the Rockie Talkies for the strong Paladin to collect the meat.

Buumi shows up quickly, simply wading through the deep snow effortlessly, shoulders both massive Elk (one hand made of green energy).

Back at the hot springs, the two Elk are dumped in front of the dragon and she inhales to cook them. The group dives out of the way and the Elk are roasted.

Vaelstraza takes an entire Elk herself and leaves the other for everyone else (including cats).

Full from a good mea, warm and enjoying a beautiful clear night the group looks upon the scene before them. A beautiful Dragon lounging in hot-springs, deep in the winter mountains of Luruar on a clear December night, the light of Selune shining off the pure white snow.

The group sleeps for the night.
