## Free at Last

The group found themselves at the bottom of the crater once occupied by the Illithid hive. No snow fell, but the wind bit hard this high in the mountains and the sun hung low on the horizon. Fëanon broke down in tears — finally free of the whispers that had plagued him for fifty years. Tark and Buumi consoled him while even Patches seemed moved.

Searching for shelter, Patches spotted a patch of white nearby and investigated. It was not snow but a bone pile — the Illithids' dumping ground. She picked through the remains and found a collection of jewellery stripped of its gemstones — wedding rings, earrings, worth perhaps seven hundred and fifty gold — and an Archmage's brooch from Silverymoon. The rest of the group found a small cave among the rubble and made camp, setting a fire in a natural chimney.

As the rocks and debris finally settled, they heard the wails of the wounded and dying — the Amnian force that had been in the area when the hive collapsed. The group stayed to make camp while Patches scaled the sheer crater walls for a better view. She reached the top just in time to see a wounded Amnian soldier stagger to the edge and peer dazedly in, apparently not seeing the soft glow of the campfire below. Cyrrus sent his owl overhead and from the air the picture became clear: a field of blood and corpses, the earth torn open as if the Illithid sentry golems had sprung from beneath it. All but thirty of a two-hundred-strong force had been slaughtered. The survivors were attempting to consolidate and tend to their wounded.

## Aid to the Amnians

Patches rushed back to inform the group and found them already making plans. Gundren stayed behind with Alura, the Mindslayers, Gwen and Fëanon while the rest headed to the surface. Cyrrus and Buumi floated up by levitation, Patches scaled the cliff face, and Tark simply leapt twice — barely making the rim and startling the concussed Amnian soldier.

The group convinced the wounded man he needed help and Buumi healed his head wound. The now clear-headed soldier recognised who they were and grew reluctant, but the group pressured him into leading them to the larger batch of survivors. There they found Captain Omar — an older man in his fifties with a huge bristly grey moustache, serious dark eyes and rich armour, a white turban and gold helm — seated astride a warhorse, surveying the carnage.

The group struck a deal: they would heal as many of his men as they could. Cyrrus and Buumi made rounds, finding the most severe injuries and stabilising them. Tark, Patches and Gwen commandeered a small sled, dumped the crossbow bolts and went around the battlefield collecting the wounded. Patches steered while Tark stabilised each one. She found several intact healing potions on the dead and used a few to save the living — pocketing the rest.

By the time the cries of the wounded had faded to silence, many lives had been saved. Omar was saddened but immensely grateful. His surviving men had set up a winter camp as the sun went down. The Captain remarked bitterly that his force had not been prepared for this engagement — his anger directed not at the group but at his commanding officer.

Two horses galloped over from another cluster of survivors. Abdul Al Suyuuk dismounted, flanked by a cloaked wizard the group did not recognise. Abdul saw the group and erupted, blaming them for the disaster and moving to order an attack. Omar and the wizard stepped close and talked him down in Amnian. Red-faced, Abdul turned his horse and galloped back to his personal guard, the wizard in close pursuit.

Omar apologised and thanked the group before ordering them to leave so as not to further provoke his superior. As they departed, he tossed a small ring to Cyrrus — a token of his gratitude. Patches, meanwhile, lingered above, stalking Abdul back to his camp. She overheard the robed wizard being called Leigham but could make out nothing else of their conversation. Feeling the cold bite, she crept to Abdul's horse, emptied his saddlebags of twenty-five platinum and a very fine set of rations, and returned to camp. She handed the fancy rations to Fëanon to cheer him up.

## The Bag and the Pull

The next morning the group packed up and left the crater, finding that the Amnians had departed even earlier. On the march, Tark opened his bag of holding to inspect the new artefact fragment. As the bag opened, a charge of energy built around him and twenty feet behind on the path, Buumi lurched forward as if shoved. Tark closed the bag quickly and eyed his friend with suspicion.

After half a day of uneventful travel — sledding on Buumi's shield and using the packed snow of the Amnians' passage as a road — the group reached the village of Gashaus, where they had met Marian, Abner's daughter. They barged into the inn and found the fiery young woman passed out from drink. Fëanon took her upstairs to rest while the party settled in for the night, reuniting with their mounts and Mr. Pickles.

The next morning, a grumpy Marian woke to find her inn full of adventurers and grudgingly made breakfast. The Mindslayers and Alura decided to stay in Gashaus until the snow eased, helping Marian and the villagers. The group agreed and pushed on alone.

That night, Cyrrus and Fëanon contacted Megno Slatesunder through a dream spell. Fëanon told the enchanter that the Illithid influence was gone. Megno was genuinely happy to hear his friend was free. Fëanon then told him about the Dwarven adventurer's journal and the need for a translation of Old Delzoun — a language Megno had recently been studying. The enchanter agreed enthusiastically and said he would meet them in Silverymoon within the week, as he was already planning to attend treaty negotiations there.

## A Lazy Morning

Mr. Pickles brewed tea for Patches and produced a pouch of Orcish Rudgrub Hash he had found in the pantry. Patches took the hash to sell later. Fascinated by the ritual, Fëanon asked for a cup and thoroughly enjoyed the green tea alongside the wine and smoked meats Patches had given him.

Over tea, Fëanon asked Patches about her training. She revealed that her brother — the Weapons Master of her noble house — had taught her combat from a young age. At twenty, she had been sent to train as a cleric of Lolth. The group pressed for more and extracted a story about Patches spending time in a Baldur's Gate circus — to catch a target — where she had learned knife throwing. Tark grabbed an apple and asked for a demonstration. Patches hit it perfectly, slicing it in half. Buumi missed with his hammer and smashed a hole in the wall. The Mindslayers sighed and set about patching it.

## The Glider

After the lazy morning, the group decided to find the glider they had arrived in. Half a mile from town, they pieced together their memories of the night and narrowed down the location beneath the fresh snowfall. Finding nothing with bare hands, Fëanon summoned a massive spectral hand and swept the snow aside. Just before the spell ended, the top of the glider was uncovered.

They spent hours excavating and de-frosting the craft above the treeline. Fëanon tried to wrench the door open against what he assumed was ice — until Cyrrus simply unlocked it. Inside, Fëanon found a piece of purple chalk he had left behind and spent several minutes sketching a teleportation circle to get them back to Silverymoon. He activated the circle. Nothing happened. He tried again with the same result. Studying the runes and meditating on the magical emanations, he determined the problem was not on his end — the Mythal was active and disrupting teleportation in and out of the city.

Alarmed, Fëanon informed the group. They would have to fly.

Meanwhile, Gundren took several of his shells and blackpowder charges and built a large firework rocket, strapping it to the craft. Everyone took positions — Gundren at the pilot's seat, Fëanon as co-pilot, Patches, Cyrrus, Mr. Pickles and the cats in the back, Buumi and Tark outside to push. They ran with the glider, picking up speed on the snowy slope, until Buumi hopped inside and Tark leapt on top, content to hang on. The craft launched off a cliff and began a lazy glide into the valley. Fëanon took the stick while Gundren ran back and lit the rocket. The glider surged higher — Tark screaming from the roof as it shook — before the rocket tore free and careened into the mountainside, detonating a small avalanche.

The glider covered a good twenty miles before Fëanon brought it in for a landing, aiming for the snow-covered Tradesway between Sundabar and Silverymoon. Ten feet above the ground, one wing clipped a tree and was ripped away, sending Tark flying into a snowbank and the glider crunching down the last few feet. The mangled craft slid to a halt. Tark waved from far behind, then slumped back into the cold white powder. The group came together laughing, fierce grins on every face.

## The Hot Springs

The sun set quickly behind the mountains and the cold of night crept in. Gundren noticed the river here was oddly clear of ice and spotted a warm stream flowing in from the hills. They waded through the deep snow, found the hot-spring-fed stream and followed it to its source — hoping for a warm place to camp.

Patches took point. A splashing sound reached them from ahead. She crept forward into a de-frosted clearing around a large heated pool. Blue, steaming water shimmered in the moonlight, an ice waterfall trickling in at the back to moderate the temperature of the volcanic spring. And lounging in the pool was a young Red Dragon.

Patches froze behind a tree and whispered over the rockie talkies. The dragon heard and began calling out, her tone oddly friendly. The group — reasoning they had fought worse — walked into view. The dragon looked around in surprise, then settled back into the pool with casual confidence. She introduced herself as Vaelstraza, a migrating young Red, looking to make her home in Gauntlgrym after hearing the call of the Fire Primordial Magaera.

The group engaged the dragon in conversation. Tark eventually grew comfortable enough to dive into the pool — and got a little burned — swimming alongside her. Patches came out from behind her tree once it became clear the dragon would not attack. As thoughts turned to food, Vaelstraza casually mentioned eating one or two of them. The group chuckled — because everyone present knew how that fight would end — and offered dinner instead.

Patches headed into the night to hunt. She found a nearby elk herd, slid across the frozen snow crust and quietly slit the throats of two large specimens before the scent of blood startled the rest into flight. She field-dressed the kills and called Buumi on the rockie talkies. The paladin arrived moments later, wading effortlessly through the deep snow, and shouldered both massive elk — one hand of flesh, one of glowing green energy.

Back at the springs, the two elk were dumped before the dragon. Vaelstraza inhaled and roasted them in a single breath as the group dove for cover. She claimed an entire elk for herself and left the other for everyone else, cats included.

Full from a good meal, warm and enjoying a beautiful clear night, the group took in the scene — a dragon lounging in hot springs deep in the winter mountains of Luruar, the light of Selûne shining off the pure white snow. They slept without setting a watch for the first time in months.
