The group rested through the morning in the Troll Hills, healing wounds and savouring the sunlight before beginning the trek back to Baldur’s Gate. Along the way, Patches learned about the Duergar prisoner in the stables and slipped off to deal with him in her own fashion. Doctor Breakfast remembered another creature in the stables — Bubbles, a six-inch horse — and scooped the tiny animal up as her very own pocket steed. Tark, still battered from the previous battle, winced as he pulled a loose tooth from his mouth. Cyrrus immediately asked for it — payment for his patron — and Tark handed it over without question. Buumi sighed, walked over, and laid healing hands on Tark’s jaw. The tooth regenerated with a crackle of bone and a wet pop. Tark yelped in surprise but grinned.

## Lady Faye’s Reward

Baldur’s Gate was still busy despite the nightly undead fog. The guards looked harrowed. At Lady Faye’s manor, the staff welcomed the group warmly and Lady Faye paid them seventy-five hundred gold for her rescue and the amethyst from the Stone Golem. She sent Zhink to accompany the group while Patches ran one last mission for her mistress.

Despite the late hour, the group headed straight for the merchant quarter to commission magical items from the tailor they had saved from the anti-necromancer fanatics. They found his shop closed for the night. Fëanon misty-stepped inside, tripping the rudimentary magical alarm and disabling it with a snap of his fingers. The tailor stumbled downstairs wielding a kitchen knife, came face to face with Fëanon, and was instantly resigned to shenanigans. He let his exasperation be known as Fëanon opened the door for the rest of the group — all of whom had been watching through the window.

## The Crafting

Nine thousand five hundred gold changed the tailor’s attitude entirely. Gundren and the Rockseeker brothers climbed from the Tavern of Doors and set up their workshop alongside the master craftsman. Buumi and Doctor Breakfast remained to bless the work and lend divine power.

Outside, Tark grew bored and wandered into the street with Zhink. The happy chirps of a familiar canary stopped him cold — Ysera had found him again. Overjoyed, Tark play-sparred with the golden bird. Zhink, caught up in the excitement, drew his sword to join in, then thought better of it and challenged Tark to a proper spar instead.

Cyrrus, equally bored, disguised himself as the tailor and went door to door through the merchant quarter, conning residents into handing over gold for a fabricated investment opportunity. He walked away with a hundred gold. In a few days, people would probably ask the real tailor about their investments — but that was the tailor’s problem, and the man was ten thousand gold richer, so Cyrrus figured he would not care.

After twelve hours of intense work, two artifacts of significant power were completed. For Fëanon: the Alhoon’s Mantle — the leathery skin of the Alhoon’s face fashioned into a hood and mask, set on an enchanted silk mantle trimmed with precious gems, an adamantite clasp, and cut phylactery gem shards capping the eye holes. It granted resistance to psychic attacks, telepathy, and the ability to delve into minds. Strangely, while wearing it, all of Fëanon’s words came out as a watery gurgle, so he resorted to his newly gifted telepathy to communicate. For JmJm: a shapeshifting cloak — a mantle of crow feathers stitched to doppelganger skin and dyed with goblin blood, collared in green dragon scales and clasped with ruby-encrusted adamantite, hanging over midnight-blue silk flecked with millions of mithril specks. It granted protection, disguise self at will, and alter self once per long rest.

## The Tooth Fairy’s Dream

The group retired to the Tavern of Doors. Cyrrus found a new room had grown for him — an Astral Goblin janitor was inside cleaning a blood-marked sigil off the floor and setting up furniture, including the largest, most opulent bed he had ever seen. That night, Cyrrus dreamed the same dream as every night: trapped in a desolate expanse of blackness, a plane of water stretching in every direction as the only floor. Mediocris Dente whispered to him. Cyrrus offered the treasure and tooth he had collected. Pleased, the entity returned his ring of protection and departed. Cyrrus remained in the dream expanse, alone and fully aware of the passage of time for hours.

## JmJm Is Gone

Tark and Zhink bunked together, Zhink claiming the bottom. In the middle of the night, Steven — JmJm’s goblin butler — woke them with a shriek: "He’s GoooooOOOOoooooone!" The group gathered around JmJm’s door, which was stuck fast. Buumi, still half-drunk, walked up and knocked it off its hinges with a single stiff-armed punch. Cyrrus arrived in a sleepy stupor, forgetting to maintain his illusion — revealing his true form for the first time: an emaciated blue tiefling with tattered clothes, long stringy hair, and missing teeth. Realising he was exposed, he hastily disguised himself as JmJm, but the gig was up and he dropped it immediately.

JmJm’s room was opulent to the point of absurdity. Tark looked at the four-poster curtained bed and wondered bitterly why his own bed was a tiny bunkbed. At the back of the room stood another door, unassuming but thrumming with magical energy that grew outward in veins and roots. Before anyone could open it, a portal folded into existence — edges collapsing in on themselves in an endless fractal — and deposited a naked blue man into the room before vanishing.

The bewildered figure was a planeswalking entity called Intent, newly arrived in a humanoid body and deeply confused by its functions. The group shortened his name to Tent, gave him spare clothes, and introduced him to civilization. Buumi offered whiskey. Tent chugged half the skin before Buumi snatched it back, aghast. Moments later, Tent let out a cry of alarm, claiming he was leaking. The group stood around as he wet himself, discovering his anatomy for the very first time.

## Descent to Goblin Town

Losing interest in the urine-soaked planeswalker, Tark opened the strange door and found a rough-hewn stone spiral stair descending into darkness. A fallen sign read simply: "down." Before heading too far, Buumi handed Tent a hunting knife and sheath, and Doctor Breakfast gave him her elven chain, which magically resized to fit — albeit very snugly. A blue man in pee-soaked pants, wielding a large knife and wearing a chain shirt far too small for him, joined the expedition into the depths.

Hundreds of steps down, the group reached a chamber with another staircase and another fallen sign: "down." Fëanon spotted a hidden door, opened it onto a dark tunnel, and shot a ball of magical light into the chamber at its end. Cursing and shouting erupted from a small croaky voice. At the mention of JmJm’s name, the voice’s owner scrambled out — a small goblin woman with hedgehog quills and a cute snout nose. Foxy Crazy told them JmJm had come through recently, led by the Goblin King of Goblin Town. She warned the group that anyone entering Goblin Town without disguises never returned, and hauled out a cart of garbage to outfit them.

Buumi refused, polishing his plate armour with a silken handkerchief. After hearing about the fate of the undisguised, he reluctantly draped his clean bedsheets over himself as a barrier beneath a filthy burlap tarp. Cyrrus, meanwhile, dropped his illusion entirely — feeling free to be himself for once — and enthusiastically piled on trash. Foxy Crazy was instantly enamoured by the dirty, ugly tiefling and invited him back into her hovel. Cyrrus enthusiastically agreed. The entire group stood outside in smelly garbage, waiting in awkward silence. They did not have to wait long.

Thoroughly disgusted, the group began the next leg of their journey — down, down, to Goblin Town.
