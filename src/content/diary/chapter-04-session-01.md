The group enjoys a much deserved rest, enjoying the morning sun as it washes over the Troll hills.  The group heals their wounds and begins their trek back to Baldur's Gate.  On the way, the group discusses their reward for saving Lady Faye and Patches finds out about the Duergar prisoner currently held in the Stables and goes down to interrogate him (murder him...).  With a Start, Doc B. remembers another creature in the stables that needs attention, and heads down, to find Bubbles the tiny horse, in the hallway.  Doc B picks up bubbles, the 6 inch horse and begins to carry him around as her very own pocket steed.  Looking at his injuries from the previous battle, Tark pulls a loose tooth from his mouth with a wince.  Cyrrus immediately asks if he can have it, and Tark hands it right over.  Sighing at the state of Tark, Buumi walks over and uses his healing hands on him, immediately regenerating the missing tooth with a crackle of bone and wet pop.  Tark let's out a startled yelp, but is quite happy.

The group makes it back to Baldurs Gate without incident, and notes that there is still heavy foot traffic in and out of the city, even with the Undead fog coming every night now.  The guards are looking harrowed by the nightly encounters.

Making it back to Lady Faye's manor, the group are treated to a warm welcome by the staff and discuss their payment.  For their saving of Lady Faye, and the Amethyst from the stone Golem, Lady Faye pays the group 7500gp and sends Zhink with the group while Patches runs one last mission for her Mistress.  The group decides that despite the hour, they wish to begin crafting some magical items and head directly to the merchant quarter and the tailor they saved previously from the anti-necromancer fanatics. 

Arriving at the tailors shop, they find him closed down for the night.  Not letting that stop them, Fey misty steps inside, immediately setting off the rudimentary magical alarm and then turning it off with a snap of his fingers.  Hearing swearing, a loud thud and running footsteps, the tired Tailor stumbles down the stairs with a knife, ready to defend his shop, and comes face to face with Fey'Anon.  Instantly resigned to shenanigans, the man lets his exasperation be known as he recognizes his erstwhile saviors from a few days before.  Fey lets the rest of the group inside since they were all looking in through the window.

Explaining they need his services, they haggle with the tailor, and agree to pay 9500gp for the Tailor to lend his skills to the creation of two powerful magical artifacts.  He immediately changes his attitude at the promise of a mountain of gold.  At this point, Gundren and the brothers hop from the extra-dimensional Tavern box and begin setting up their workshop. With the Rockseekers, and the master Tailor they begin crafting away.  Buumi remains with the crafters, blessing them and lending holy power along with Doc. B. 

While the crafting is happening, Tark goes outside, a little bored by the whole affair.  Zhink follows.  As he looked up and down the street, Tark hears the happy chirps of his lost Canary and finds himself face to face with Ysera.  Overjoyed, Tark began to play-spar with her.  Caught up in the excitement, Zhink drew his sword to begin smashing things, but thought better of it after a moment and asked Tark to Spar instead.

Also bored by the whole crafting thing, Cyrrus decided to take advantage of the down time.  Disguising himself as the same tailor helping the group (with Disguise self), Cyrrus went door to door in the merchant quarter, conning each person that answered their door into giving him some gold as an investment opportunity.  Being only partially successful, Cyrrus walked away with 100gp.  In a few days, people would probably ask the tailor about their investment, about which the tailor would have no knowledge, but that's his problem…and not Cyrrus'. Also, the tailor is about 10,000gp richer so he probably won't care…

Inside the shop, items of significant power are being wrought, and after twelve hours of intense work, they are completed.

For Fey'Anon, The Alhoons' Mantle is created. With the leathery skin of the Alhoons face as a hood and mask, an enchanted silk mantle trimmed with numerous precious gems, an Adamantite clasp and cut Phylactery gem shards capping the eye holes.  The mantle is visually impressive and magically powerful.  It grants the wearer resistance to Psychic attacks, Telepathy and the ability to delve into the minds of others.  Strangely though, while wearing it, all words spoken by Fey'anon come out in a watery gurgle, so he resorts to the newly gifted telepathy to communicate.

For Jack Meyer Johnson Matthews, a shapeshifting cloak is crafted.  A mantle of Crow feathers, stitched to a Doppleganger skin and died with goblin blood, with a collar made of green dragon scales and fastened with a ruby encrusted adamantite clasp, it hangs down to mid bicep.  Beneath the mantle, is a cloak of midnight blue silk with millions of flecks of Mithril seemingly laquered onto it's surface and the hem is stitched with cat fur thread into intricate floral weaving designs.  The cloak grants +1 ac, being surprisingly resilient.  Additionally, the wearer can cast disguise self at will, and Alter self once per long rest.

Exhausted from the nights work, and extremely happy with the result, the group retires to the box to rest again.  Cyrrus heads in to find a new room has grown for him, he finds an Astral Goblin janitor inside cleaning up a blood marked sigil on the floor and setting up furniture, including the largest most opulent bed he has ever seen.  Settling down for the night, Cyrrus dreams the same dream as every night; trapped in a desolate expanse of blackness with a plane of water extending in every direction as the only floor.  Hearing the whisper of his Patron - The Tooth Fairy, Cyrrus offers it the treasure and tooth he has collected.  Pleasing the entity, it gifts Cyrrus back the ring of protection and then leaves.  Cyrrus remains in the dream expanse, alone and fully aware of the passage of time for the next several hours.

Tark and Zhink bunk up together, sharing the bunkbed.  Zhink get's bottom bunk.  In the middle of the rest (day?) Tark and Zhink are awoken by the cries of Steven, JmJm's Goblin butler.   "He's GoooooOOOOoooooone!!!" exclaimed Steven in a panic.  They are then led to JmJm's door, finding out from Steven that he cannot find his master they attempt to enter the room, but the  door is stuck fast.  Awakened by the racket, the rest of the group gathers around the door with Buumi drunkenly looking on.  Seeing that no one can put the necessary strength into opening the door, Buumi walks up to it and with a single stiff-armed punch, knocks the door from it's hinges.   Arriving in a sleepy stupor, Cyrrus forgets to disguise himself and appears without illusion - looking like a strange blue tiefling hobo: emaciated,  with tattered clothes, long stringy thinning hair and missing more than a few teeth.  Realizing he is "naked" he disguises himself as the first thing that comes to mind, Jack Meyer Johnson Matthews….but the gig is up and no one buys it and he drops it quickly.

The group sees JmJm's room and it is opulent and ridiculous to the extreme.  Tark looks at the four poster curtained bed and wonders why his bed is just a tiny bunkbed but doesn’t well on it for too long.   At the back of the room is another door.  Despite looking unassuming, when investigating it magically, the group can feel energy growing out of it in veins and roots. Going to open the door, the group are stopped by the formation of a magical portal, it's edges folding in on themselves in an endless fractal and are greeted by the sight of a naked blue man deposited into the room by the now vanishing portal.  He looks quite confused.  The group is also confused and asks him where he came from and why he's naked.  The group determines that the nude blue man is a planeswalking entity that changes bodies and this humanoid one is a new one fro him (he is confused by his penis's function).  The group get's him some spare clothes and Buumi decides to show the man his way of life, and begins by offering him some whiskey.  The blue man - "Intent" by name, and shortened to Tent by the group - chugs the whiskey, unaware of the danger, and gulps a good half of the Whiskey-skin before Buumi snatches it from his hands, aghast.

Tent then let out a cry of alarm, claiming he was leaking!  The group stood around as he wet himself, using parts of his anatomy for the very first time…

Losing interest in the randomly appearing blue man soaked in urine, Tark goes to the strange door and jerks it open, finding a rough hewn stone spiral stair descending into darkness. The group picks up a fallen sign, which simply says "down".  They follow the sign.  Before going too far, Buumi hands Tent a hunting knife and sheath, and Doc B. hands him her elven chain, it magically resizing to fit him - albeit very snugly.  A blue man, with pee soaked pants, wielding a large knife and wearing a chain shirt far too small for him, joins the expedition into the depths of the extra-planar tavern the group calls home.

Descending hundreds of steps, the group finds themselves in a chamber of some sort, with another set of spiral staircases leading further down at the far end.  Another fallen sign reads "down".  Looking around, Fey'Anon spots a hidden door, and opening it a dark and small tunnel.  He promptly shoots a ball of magical light down it into a small chamber at it's end, and promptly begins to hear cursing and shouting from a small croaky voice.  Upon mentioning that the group is looking for Jack Meyer Johnson Matthews, the owner of the little voice scrambles down the tunnel into the chamber and the group are met with a small Goblin lady, seemingly with quills like a hedgehog and a cute little hedgehog snout nose.  The group finds out from Foxy Crazy (the goblin lady) that JmJm came through a short time ago, being led by the Goblin king of Goblin town and that if the group means to go after him, they should definitely don disguises.  She then pulls out a cart of trash from her home and begins to "decorate" the group with garbage disguises.  Buumi is having none of it and keeps polishing his beautiful plate armor with a silken hanky.  Finally relenting after hearing that the last group of people to go to Goblin Town without disguises never returned, he finally relents and grabs his clean bed sheets from his room, using it as a barrier between himself and a larger very dirty burlap tarp covered in garbage draped over his head.

While this is happening, Cyrrus drops his illusion disguise, feeling like he can freely be himself and begins to enthusiastically don trash.  Foxy Crazy is quickly enamored by the dirty and ugly Tiefling and invites him back into her hovel for a quickie, to which Cyrrus enthusiastically agrees.  The entire group watches this in awkward silence, standing outside the hovel, in smelly garbage, waiting for the strange Tiefling.  They did not have to wait too long.

Thoroughly disgusted and awkward, the group begins the next leg of their journey, heading down, down, to Goblin Town.
