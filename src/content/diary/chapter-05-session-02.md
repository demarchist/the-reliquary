## Arrivals and Departures

The group surveyed the aftermath of the roadside battle and decided there was nothing left to do. Just as they prepared to move on, JmJm faded into mist and vanished — swallowed by the strange magic of Barovia without so much as a farewell. Moments later, Gundren burst from a shallow grave in a fountain of dirt and dwarven curses, Gwen padding out of the fog behind him. The cursed mists gave and took as they pleased.

The fog began to burn off and the village resolved into dark shapes through the haze. Above them, Castle Ravenloft appeared for the first time — spearlike, rising atop a massive stone pillar a thousand feet above the valley floor. Its towers and parapets clawed at the sky, dark Gothic architecture raking upward until the tallest spires were lost in the low cloud cover. The castle loomed over everything, oppressive and deliberate.

## Morgantha's Pastries

Cold mist, light rain, and a moaning wind tormented the group through the empty fields. The occasional scarecrow loomed out of the murk. At the outskirts, they spotted a woman standing near the edge of town with a basket and a young child's hand in hers. Patches donned her old-lady disguise and Cyrrus altered his appearance into a hulking Vistani bass player. The effort at subtlety was undermined somewhat by the burly dwarf with a cannon, the elf in a squid-faced mask riding a ghostly steed, and the paladin in full plate atop a war tiger. The woman took one look and fled into town carrying her child.

The streets were deserted. Many houses stood empty, their windows smashed from frames, deep claw-scores gouged into the wood. Dark rooms yawned beyond. Sobbing and wailing drifted from the far side of town. Buumi prayed to Helm and confirmed what they all suspected — many of the abandoned buildings harboured undead.

The squeak of a rusty wheel cut through the silence. Far up a street, an old woman in a colourful red shawl was pushing a cart of pastries. She stopped at a house, knocked, exchanged a few words with the occupant, handed over a pastry, and received a boy in return. The child was ejected into the old woman's waiting arms, and she continued down the street toward the group.

Morgantha, as she introduced herself, was friendly enough. The group grew suspicious and investigated her wares. They discovered the truth in stages: the old lady was a hag, the pastries were made from human flesh, and the child she had just received was destined to become her next batch of filling. Cyrrus ate a single bite before the revelation and collapsed unconscious, dreaming of a wonderful, impossibly beautiful place.

Before the group could attack and free the child, Fëanon seized Morgantha and teleported her away, asking to be taken to her master — Baba Lysaga. The hag refused but said she would be watching and would consider it, then melted into the ground with a spell. Fëanon returned to a flustered group now in custody of a Barovian child named Chekov. The boy, having just learned he was sold to a hag to be baked into pastries, was understandably hysterical. He clung to Patches — still disguised as a kindly grandmother — and Buumi decided to train the lad as his squire.

## The Burgomaster's Plea

The group pressed into the centre of town. A patrol of guardsmen was breaching one of the abandoned houses — weapons and flintlocks drawn. Patches spider-webbed to the rooftop and peered through a third-storey window to see a shambling zombie with twin points of orange light for eyes. The door burst open and a guard hacked it apart in seconds. Ordinary business in Barovia.

At the Blood on the Vine Tavern, they met Irmesk, son of the late Burgomaster and now bearing his father's title. He told them Strahd had been attacking the town with his minions for weeks. His father had died three nights prior. Things had been quiet since, but no one believed the reprieve would last. Irmesk begged the group to escort his adopted sister, Ireena, to the fortified town of Vallaki on the far side of the mountain — somewhere safer from Strahd's obsession. The vampire lord was fixated on Ireena because she bore an uncanny resemblance to his long-dead bride, Tatyana.

At the Burgomaster's mansion — battered and scarred from repeated assaults — they found the old man's body in a coffin awaiting burial. Ireena was already clad for war: halfplate, pistol, and sword. She agreed to leave, but only after her father was properly buried. Fëanon summoned an unseen servant to begin digging the grave while the group transported the coffin.

## Gowain

As the funeral procession made its way downhill, a panicked guardsman came running. The High Abbot — Gowain — was in the town square, holding a girl hostage. Ireena rushed to the scene with the group on her heels.

They found a tall, gangly man in a leather duster and a wolf-skin wide-brimmed hat. His eyes were milky white, and he held a sickle blade to the girl's throat, attached to a long chain. Gowain had no interest in negotiation. He magically froze Ireena and Irmesk in place, slit the girl's throat with a laugh, and attacked.

The battle was vicious. Gowain teleported constantly — striking hard, vanishing, reappearing somewhere unexpected. Two invisible shadow monks flanked and protected him, their presence only revealed when they struck. Tark managed to stabilise the dying girl and Cyrrus healed her wound with Selune's light. Fëanon hammered at Gowain's mind but found it nearly impenetrable. Cyrrus, badly hurt and desperate, polymorphed his owl familiar into a Tyrannosaurus Rex — the first one anyone in Barovia had ever seen, or indeed knew existed.

Darkness spells, faerie fire, a well-thrown Molotov, and relentless melee attacks brought one shadow monk down and left Gowain and the other in dire straits. Tark, using his truesight, spotted a powerful ring on Gowain's finger and mid-fight attempted to steal it. Just as the ring slipped free, Gowain teleported away, abandoning the battle and his surviving monk — who was quickly destroyed. In the confusion, Gowain left his hat behind. Tark picked it up and plopped it on his head with a grin.

Ireena, freed from the ice, spat that Gowain was an insane dog and a servant of Strahd. The group hurried to the hilltop church to finish the burial, ready to be done with this wretched town.
