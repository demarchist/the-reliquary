The group stands around in the Market, blood everywhere as the mangled Derro remains continue to seep.

The Duergar captain looks over the group, unsure how to proceed, until a runner approaches quickly.

A whispered word and the Captain turns to his squad and calls out that they are needed at another Riot in the Furrow and the Stoneguard turn to leave, bustling away.

The group look at one another and Cirrus loudly exclaims that he HATES the Underdark, that it may be worse than Brovia even.

The group discusses which is worse as they head back into the Gholbrorn's Lair to have Doc B give them some healing.

Tark and Gundren though are perfectly healthy and head off to find **Modo the Hunter **and descend a set of stairs to a sub-bazaar, another layer to the sprawling Duergar city.

looking down the tight alleyways and corridors, the Under-bazaar seems to house foreign traders and the lower-class.  

The air down here is thick with the scents of burning incense, food, tobacco and industrial waste...

Nearby the stairs though, is a shop run by a grizzled drow in hunting leathers with a set of scars running down his face.

The Drow is leaning on the countertop of his tiny establishment, flicking through a small book.

Tark, (as Tark Spidermann) approaches with Gundren and they call out to the Drow that matches the description of Modo.

The language barrier proves to be an annoyance that leaves Tark doing all the talking and the two begin to exchange words, Modo looking down his nose a bit at this strange non-Drow creature.

Tark asks about Phase Spiders and over the course of the conversation, comes to the conclusion that if they want the chitin, they will have to head to the **Wormwritihings** to get it as Modo will take about a month to get there himself.

Pulling a chest out from under the counter, Modo offers to sell Tark a map, mentioning that the Writhings are home to many Purple Worms, but the spiders scavange the area in great numbers.

Tark buys the map from him, almost like an illustrated journal, detailing a route up north to the Wormwrithings through a waterway.

With a MASSIVE tip, Tark tries to get a bit of extra information on entering Menzoberranzan but Modo is a bit coy, unwilling to divulge too much sensitive information to Tark as he worries he would be killed by his kin.

Tark heads off with Gundren back to the Town house, but stops with a flash of realization and runs back to Modo, getting out his journal in which he has been mapping the groups journey through the Underdark.

Tark offers a trade, his map for a map into Menzoberranzan.

Modo looks at the small Halfling, mulling it over and eventually sighs and rejects the offer.

Tark gives him the map anyway and turns to leave.

Modo makes a disgusted "tsk" and tells Tark to wait and goes on to say that there are a number of tunnels through the undercity that come out in the **Claw Rift** and that Tark should try those to get into the city undetected.  

Tark thanks Modo and heads back to the waiting Gundren and the two of them head back to the Townhouse, passing the bloodstained marketplace where slaves are loading carts with meaty Derro chunks.

As they head through the Blade Bazaar, Gundren notes that the natural flow of the market feels...off.

patting Tark to make him aware, the two look around and note numerous incidents of confrontation and arguments.

One that catches Gundren's eye is that of a cart of rotten fish with customers complaining about the spoiled goods and the merchant standing there confused.

Something is very wrong and it puts Gundren and Tark on edge, something bad is building...

Back at the Townhouse, Fey goes over the events of the day, running through everything that's happened as he tries to make sense of the building dread in the city.

He remembers the signs of the greater demon lords, remembering spontaneous re-animation as an aspect of Orcus, a power that radiates from the Demon Prince of Undeath...

Fey begins to ponder, wondering if this is at all related to the Thayan attack and the Mists from the year prior and concludes that it must all stem from Atropos drawing nearer to the Prime Material Plane.

Cirrus meanwhile, in the Townhouse himself, sequesters himself in the tiny bathroom and pulls out the tiny Soul Cage to question the Derro Soul trapped within...

He gets the name **Leemok, **the name of a demon hiding in the city, directing this cult of Derro.

He finishes poopin and heads out into the common area to the smell of rabbit stew (Rabbits provided by Patches) and the sight of half the crew tearing up after cutting onions for said stew.

Doc B sits, stirring the meal as it simmers and the group worries about Cirrus' diet.

Cirrus proclaims that he had a toilet epiphany and tells the group of the name Leemok.

Patches questions said epiphany but decides that maybe she should give the toilet the benefit of the doubt.

JmJm whispers over from the couch with the two Myconid Sprouts sleeping on his chest and asks when they can get the fuck out of the Underdark.

Tark remembers his conversation with Modo and pulls out the map to the **Wormwrithings** that he got, but also mentions the entrance to the **Grand Bazaar** in Menzoberranzan and the **Claw Rift**.

Patches nods and recounts that the **Claw Rift **was her way out of the city when she fled through the dangerous and Kobold infested tunnels.

She warns the group that it is frequented by Drow Slavers collecting Kobolds and **Bregan D'Aerthe** for smuggling.

Tark goes on and mentions that Modo wouldnt sell to him being a halfling and suggests Patches go and try herself, she nods and agrees to go.

The group idly tosses a rabbit to the cave bear cub sleeping in the corner of the room and continue their conversation, discussing their plans as they try to wrack their brains for any information on **Leemok **that Cirrus mentioned.

coming up with nothing, the group decide to try and visit the Dragon again before the group tries to extract **Claudine and her daughter **from the city.

Tark tries to get the cave bear to climb on him and koala on, but its too large.  He tries putting the Cub on Gwen, but it hates the oil and gears.

Tark tries one more time and gets it to Yoda on his back and the group heads out again into the city having rested up.

The group hires multiple (covered) Rickshaws to try and confuse pursuit and they head off through the market, once again seeing, smelling and feeling the rising tensions in the city.

The smell of rot is strong in the city.

The group heads out to the Dragon, trundling along in two separate vehicles (as it is quite a large party now).

As they go, Gundren looks out for a patrol of Merrogon Devils and as the group goes by, calls out to them 

He tells them to keep a look out for a Derro cult to Demogorgon and describes the symbol. 

Patches goes on to draw the symbol for them and hands them the paper.

They nod and march off and the group continues on.

**​**Patches remembers suddenly that there's another stop the group needs to make; she needs to collect her Bag of Holding that she comissioned to hold the Artifact.

Discussing quickly, the group decides that the quickest and safest thing to do is inform Themberchaud that they are leaving and to have him meet them at the townhouse as they extract Claudine.

They contact him with Cirrus' Tiny Messenger (as they wont trust this information to a letter), the 3ft box appearing on the floor of the large Rickshaw.

Tark hops into the box as they had agreed and pulls the lid shut.

The tiny cirrus picks up the box and vanishes as it speeds away while shrinking to nothingness.

Inside the dark box, Tark hears that it has reached the destination from a tiny muffled voice calling out "Delivery!"

The smell of sulfur begins to permeate the box interior and it grows uncomfrotably warm.

Tark raises the lid and looks up into the obese, expectant face of Themberchaud.

The dragon narrows its eyes as Tark warmly, but hurridly greets him.

Tark loudly whispers over to tell the Dragon that the city is on the verge of something terrible and that the group plans on leaving and they want Themberchaud to go with them.

The dragon leans in, replying that he has no intention of leaving and that he now knows the group is not what they first seemed.

Tark is confused by the sudddenly suspicious and unfriendly Ancient Red Dragon and ask why he would not leave when the group is so sure that his life is in danger, that he will be killed by the very Adamantine Golems that he helped to create.

The Dragon accepts this as a distinct possibility, but is still unwilling to leave his horde and his trust in the group is not absolute.  He tells Tark that the Flameguard have captured Droki.

Tark doesnt see why that matters and tries to keep persuading but is cut off by a sharp inhalation of breath from the Dragon, it hisses out in a hot wave of air, but not fire.

The Dragon then goes on to say that Droki was brought before him and named the group as accomplices working with him over the last few days and that Droki had robbed the Flameguard and Dragonhoard.  

The dragon believed his long term servants with their "proof" (technically not lying).

Themberchaud, is unsure how to proceed but cannot abandon his hoard and decides not to attack Tark, as he still doubts that he has the whole picture.

Tark residedly crouches back into the box, pulling the lid close to return (never having left the box) and once again saying to the Dragon that they only seek to save his life.

The lid closes and the box is whisked away.

Meanwhile, the others have been busy.

Patches and Fey end up going to collect claudine from the Muzgardt Brewery.

With the incidents of violence and strange rot increasing, none of the group wishes to wait any longer.

Cirrus (Disguised as Patches) goes with Gundren and Gwen to collect the Bag of Holding at the Avilthew Manufactory.

The rest of the group has instructions to wait in the Townhouse, ready to leave the city. 

Doc B. Settles the bill at the front desk.

Patches and Fey make it to the Brewery without incident, though they see several more strange clashes on the streets.

Disembarking but having the Rickshaw wait, they walk non-chalantly to **Seke's** Store.

They move in and Fey actually takes the opportunity to buy a potion or two (being an even better distraction).

Patches slips into the back and finds **Claudine and Marzeline** doing inventory.

Patches explains the situation, that they cannot wait and they have to make their escape now.

Persuaded, Claudine hugs her daughter, smiles nervously at Patches and then nods.  They will simply leave.

Patches assists the two grab as many of their own things as they can and slip out of the back room.

Seke is drawn off by Fey and they sneak out of the store, then quickly walk out of line of sight.

Fey pays for his potions and then follows, Seke none the wiser.

The group casually walks back to the rickshaw, gets in and heads to meet the others.

Cirrus, Gundren and a returned Tark meet with Patches, Fey and ex-slaves at the townhouse and enter together.

Everyone, including JmJm, Doc, Snorbul, the Myconids and the Cave Bear gathers in the center of the room and some inventory management takes place before they leave.

Patches stows The Artifact in the bag of holding, careful to only touch it with her gloves, though even then her fingers begin to burn.

As the group leaves, Patches notes activity upstairs by the Drow Embassy, several Drow figures entering the building quickly.

The group heads from the Gholbrorn's lair, rapidly moving across the city with as much speed and stealth as they can muster.

Flashing their badges and getting through the checkpoints manned by the Stoneguard, the group makes their way to The Hall of Sacred Scrolls and head inside, noting a large contingent of Devils marching away, a tall figure at their head obscured by the mass of marching bodies.

The group head in, and then descend on one of the elevators after paying the fee.

Making it to the bottom of The Hall of Sacred Scrolls, the group gathers in one of the ancient abandoned tunnels; the start of the catacombs of the Savants.

Gwen enters the pocket dimension of Gundren's bag and the two Myconid sprouts hop into Tark's, the group surprised that they can hold their breath almost indefinitely.

Now down to a manageable number and past the city defenses, Doc B starts to burn the tobacco in his pipe.

With a plume of smoke, Doc B twirls and the smoke rapidly expands, scooping the party up carrying them into the incorporeal wind.

The group windwalks rapidly through the catacombs and Whorlstone caverns, quickly arriving at Bilrigger's Sanctum, the doors still sliced from their hinges.

The group rematerializes in the sanctum, the carrion-crawlers still audible in the basement.

The party quickly stand the doors back into place and Gundren moves in, aligning them perfectly and then uncorking a large glass jar, a paintbrush stuck through the cork.

Glue dripping from the brush, he paints the cuts and they magically mend.

The doors fixed, the group shuts them and go about neutralizing the wild magic within the shielded chambers by Fey casting some low level spells.

A surge of wildmagic scrambles everyones brains with a small dose of insanity for a few minutes, but it burns the stray magic in the area.

Everyone recovers quickly, though Claudine and Marzeline looki absolutely terrified, confused and near panic.

Fey announces his intent to draw the teleportation circle (for the benefit of the mundane folk) and begins, selecting his good chalk.

Ten minutes later (with Claudine and Marzeline still clutching one another and watching in silence), he finishes and a small singularity blinks into existence.  Everyone steps into it, Claudine and Marzeline being dragged.

A flash of light fades and the group finds themselves in a beautifully construced stone chamber, a Teleportation circle etched into a block of black marble inset into the floor.  The runes of the circle glitter with crushed gemstones.

Looking around, they note that the chamber is in a bit of disarray with materials and tools stowed nearby for the construction of the place and a couple of desks set up in an impromptu "office".

Behind one of the desks of the office, is a young Elven woman dressed in Mage robes, denoting her as an adept. She looks up with a startled yelp at the teleport but quickly relaxes.

With Pale white skin, black raven hair and large bright violet yes, she has an angular face and cheeckbones that could cut glass. A Moon Elf.

and she's tiny, probably a good inch shorter than Patches but is a touch plump, a strange look on such a small elf and no doubt due to her sedintary lifestyle. 

She smiles at the group and puts down her quill, closing her spellbook.

Wiping inky fingers on her robes, she gets up to greet the party and introduces herself as **Adept Uira**.

Fey has her run off topside to fetch officer Li while the group gather themselves.

Taking their time, they ascend the hardwood staircase up two levels, to the ground floor of Fey'Anon's Wizard tower.

Looking across his home to be, Fey nods in approval at the marble, hardwoods and metal filigree, reminiscent of his homeland's architecture, but with a hint of the Dwarven eye for bold lines.

A grand staircase wraps around a large recessed pool in the center of the foyer, the black marble of the pool standing out starkly from the white marble floor.

There are tarps and stacks of materials with the place still under construction.

They head to the main set of double doors, the dark wood awaiting a carving

The woodworking tools sit next to the doors. 

The Doors are easily pushed open to swing wide and a soft spring breeze blows.

The party looks out across the small island home of Fey'Anon to a Dwarven made jetty sitting on the placid waters of the lake, the waxing moon reflects perfectly on the water and the rolling landscape of Selunia lays before them. 

Claudine lets out a gasp and falls to her knees sobbing, her daughter Marzeline crouching and holding her mother as she weeps tears of joy.
