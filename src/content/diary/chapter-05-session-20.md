## Ash and Aftermath

Grey-black ash drifted from the sky, settling thick across the abbey and the walled village below. Patches slumped against the courtyard well, bleeding from several wounds and rubbing her stinging eyes, careful not to look at Tark or the blazing greatsword in his hands. Cyrrus and Fëanon exchanged a telepathic glance and set about sorting the aftermath — Cyrrus tending wounds while Fëanon flipped to his teleportation circle.

The mists swirled and Gundren stepped through with Gwen at his side, confusion lasting only a moment before the magic of Barovia filled the gaps. Seeing Peytr's obsidian axe on the ground, the dwarf examined it with his tools and snapped his reference book shut with a sigh. Heavily cursed. He donned welding gloves, picked it up, and the group fed it to Cyrrus's bag of devouring — casting the artifact adrift in the Astral Plane.

Tark walked to the courtyard's edge and looked down the hundred-and-fifty-foot cliff. Several score villagers stood below with their arms raised, cheering for the people who had destroyed the Wild Hunt. Tark held Ashbringer aloft, its light refracting through the crystal blade, and proclaimed that Barovia's salvation was at hand. The crowd roared.

A rumble drew Patches and Fëanon to the overlook. Across the valley, a massive avalanche was cascading down the slopes of Mount Ghakis. Mordenkainen had destroyed the Amber Temple. Fëanon swore under his breath at the loss of the library, then returned to his spell preparations — only to be interrupted again as a pulse of dark energy rolled across the land. Like a beat on an impossibly large drum, a shockwave rippled outward from Castle Ravenloft.

## The Fall of Krezk

Tark looked down. More than half the villagers had stopped cheering and were staring toward the castle. Then all hell broke loose.

Wives struck husbands. Children attacked parents. In a flash of understanding, Tark realised that the hollows — the soulless denizens of Barovia — had turned on those with souls, commanded to slay every living person in the valley. Screams rose from below and Tark turned a pleading gaze on his friends. Fëanon was mid-inscription. Patches was still badly wounded. Cyrrus told him plainly that in their current state they could not save the town.

Tark found the answer unacceptable. He asked how long before the teleportation circle was ready. Three minutes. "Then I will be back in three minutes," Tark said, and leapt off the cliff.

His monk training and enchanted ring carried him safely to the village below, where he set about saving as many as he could — sweeping legs, striking temples, keeping his blows non-lethal. He carved breathing room for a young woman and a guardsman, but all around them villagers were being torn apart and the hollows outnumbered the survivors. Patches rummaged through Fëanon's bag of holding until she found the heavy crossbow. She and Gundren took position at the cliff's edge and began providing covering fire. Unhappy with the range, Patches scaled fifty feet down the cliff face for a better angle — but the villagers all looked the same. She took a shot and put a heavy quarrel through the skull of an old woman who had been beating a child to death with her cane. Tark looked up sharply. Patches shrugged.

Gundren, his thundercannon poorly suited to restraint, took a man's leg at the knee. Tark, two guardsmen, a young woman, and the town burgomaster backed against the cliff as a riot's worth of hollows sprinted toward them. High above, Gundren threw down a rope secured by Gwen. Patches webbed one of the guards and began hauling her up — but a thrown brick cracked into the woman's skull and killed her. Tark held off the press of feral villagers as the three remaining survivors grabbed the rope and were pulled up the cliff face.

The hollows hurled bricks, shingles, and rubble at the ascending survivors. Tark leapt through the air, deflecting what he could, but several struck home. Two survivors were knocked senseless and lost their grip. Patches sprinted across her ledge and snatched the falling burgomaster by his collar. Tark caught the other before they could fall far. Looking down at the hollows reaching the cliff base, Patches tossed an armed lightning trap. It triggered instantly, killing a swath in a crackling explosion.

They reached the courtyard with three survivors. Fëanon announced the circle was complete. The group piled through, dragging the stunned villagers with them as below, the feral mob began climbing the cliff.

## Argynvostholt

They emerged before the ruins of Argynvostholt. The roiling clouds of Barovia took on a reddish hue above the collapsed manor house. Investigation revealed summoned storm blasts had reduced the building to rubble. The group and the three survivors of Krezk settled in for a short rest — four hours of bandaging, eating, and taking stock.

Fëanon used one of Mordenkainen's sending stones to contact the archmage. Mordenkainen responded with a yawn, magically drained from the assault on the Amber Temple. Fëanon grumbled about the lost knowledge. Mordenkainen sighed and explained that he had checked the library — the books could not be removed and the spells within had been subtly altered, their results unreliable. Fëanon accepted the necessity and asked that a rested Buumi be sent to them. Tark took the stone and asked Mordenkainen to be present for the final battle against Rahadin and Strahd. The archmage assured him he would be there.

Fëanon completed another teleportation circle. The villagers vanished in a flash — and in their place stood the broad, armoured form of Buumi. Tark hugged his friend in a great leaping embrace. Buumi removed his faceplate and thanked the group for saving him. He moved to hug Patches, who withdrew and shook his hand instead. He accepted the awkward gesture with only a touch of disappointment.

## The Road to Berez

The group consulted the map and split up. Patches took the direct route, descending the mountainside straight into the ruins. The others took the road with their mounts.

Patches made the ruined town of Berez with grace and agility. She scouted the outskirts — rotted stone cottages rising from fetid swamp, the bodies of many werewolves scattered through the centre of town. The pack they had sent against Baba Lysaga had clearly failed. She noted a blurred shape lurking near an overgrown graveyard and gave it a wide berth, setting traps at the base of a crumbling church tower before climbing it.

Halfway up, a brick came loose under her hand. Her reflexes caught it before it could betray her position. From the top, she had a commanding view of the misty swamp. Movement in the centre of town caught her eye — a massive animated stump bearing a ramshackle stone cottage on its back, shifting on root-like legs. At its base stood a crucifix, but from her distance she could not make out the figure strung upon it.

Miles up the road, the rest of the group finished their descent to find the old path to Berez — mossy cobblestones broken by water and roots. Twenty minutes later, four figures blocked their way. The vampire adventurers — Strahd's enslaved servants and former companions of Gowain — stood waiting.

Kenga, the dwarven cleric, stepped forward and greeted them. He and his fellows were commanded to kill, he said. They did not want to, but they could not disobey. He looked at Tark and reminded the monk of their deal — that the group would slay him and free him from his waking nightmare.

Tark hefted Ashbringer and nodded. A globe of darkness dropped over the monk and the vampires spread out to engage.

Tark activated his blindfold's magic and saw through the blackness. He shadowstepped behind Kenga and unleashed a flurry of strikes. The vampire battlemaster Growland managed to parry one blow meant for the dwarf. Lelrin, the vampire ranger, loosed a stream of arrows at the group. Cyrrus turned invisible and splashed through the swamp toward her. Buumi and Gwen rushed Growland with hammer and claw as Gundren and Fëanon poured fire into the melee.

Tark hit Kenga half a dozen times. The vampire dwarf fell to his knees. Just before the killing blow, Tark heard him whispering a prayer to Moradin — hoping to see his kin soon. One swift strike took the head. The darkness vanished and Kenga crumbled to ash.

Beerna, the vampire barbarian, roared for her fallen comrade and waded into Tark with greatsword strikes that wounded him badly. Tark battered her with Ashbringer until she cast aside her sword, swept the halfling into a crushing bear hug, and sank her fangs into his neck. Growland fell quickly to Gwen, Gundren, Fëanon, and Buumi — his spirit escaping as his body crumbled. Cyrrus, stung by several arrows, managed to close on Lelrin and slipped his bag of devouring over her head. The bag bit down and began to devour her. Tark broke free of Beerna with a shadowstep and struck her with the crystal greatsword. She detonated in a sunburst that set Lelrin ablaze as well.

The group caught their breath. Tark reached out to the spirit of his sword and found it satisfied — truly destroying the vampires had freed them from enslavement. Buumi rested a hand on Tark's shoulder, raised his visor, and smiled down at his friend. They had done a good deed. Tark wrapped Ashbringer in its silk cover and handed it to Buumi for safekeeping, taking up the Staff of the Dragon King once more.

## The Hut

The group reached the edge of Berez and contacted Patches. She relayed what she had seen — blurred shapes in ambush positions, the animated hut, the crucified figure. They crept in through the mist and saw it for themselves. From their angle, the figure on the crucifix was recognisable: Ophelia, the surviving night hag from the Old Bonegrinder.

Tark sneaked to the hut and the crucified hag without incident. He called up to Ophelia, who spat on him and glared but said nothing. Shrugging, Tark climbed the roots of the animated structure and peered through an open window.

The interior was small — no more than twenty feet square, filled with crumbling furniture. In the centre stood a beautiful baby crib holding a cherubic infant boy, clashing grotesquely with the body parts, bones, and grisly trophies covering every surface. Against one wall, a breathtaking young woman bathed in a tub of blood. Tark was caught staring. The woman turned her head and smiled. He ducked below the sill. A chuckle came from within, and Baba Lysaga called him by name, inviting him inside.

Tark knocked. She invited him again. He stepped through the door and found the woman robed and standing beside the crib, fawning over the child. Cyrrus climbed up to observe through the window. Buumi and Fëanon approached from the far side, noting blurred shapes moving to surround them.

Looking upon Lysaga, Cyrrus found himself unable to believe she could be a threat — forming strong feelings of protectiveness and trust. Fëanon touched his mind to ask what he saw and received emphatic reassurances that the witch was harmless. Inside, Tark examined the baby more closely and noticed Lysaga's fingers clipping through it — an illusion. She spoke of it as Strahd, her child, praising what the man had become. Tark summoned light and shadow to create a duplicate of the illusory baby, placing it in the crib beside the first. Lysaga's face turned to stone.

The group closed in. Patches reached the window opposite Cyrrus. Buumi climbed to the warlock's position — and as his protective auras washed over Cyrrus, the glamour shattered. Cyrrus immediately told Fëanon to disregard every good word he had said and warned the group that the witch was actively charming them. Buumi looked around the swamp uneasily. They had been drawn into a central, exposed position.

Inside, Tark stated their purpose: for her crimes against the people of Barovia and the corruption of Strahd, Baba Lysaga would not be leaving the valley. The witch scoffed. She would grind their bones to flour and use their flesh for stew. Do your worst, she said — and vanished. The illusion had fulfilled its purpose.

High above the hut, floating atop a disembodied giant skull, the true Baba Lysaga revealed herself. She was monstrous — skeletal arms far too long for a human, tipped with filthy claws. An elk skull covered her head, its huge antlers strung with flayed human skin. Dirty black robes dangled with grisly trophies and fetishes. The high priestess of Atropos attacked.

## The Battle of Berez

Lysaga gestured with a bony claw and hurled a finger of death at Cyrrus. Fëanon stepped forward, raised his staff in both hands, and deflected the spell in a flash of sickly green light — the necrotic energy careening into the swamp. Patches rushed forward and flung a throwing knife into the hag's side, the poison paralysing Lysaga for an instant. Long enough for Patches to web up to the skull and slam her dagger deep into the witch's flank. Lysaga shrieked, batted Patches from the platform, and circled thirty feet above the group.

She struck Fëanon with a blast of cold that encrusted his arm in ice. He shattered it with his staff, mitigating the worst. Howls went up around the perimeter — blurred shapes sprinting through the mist — just as a boulder sailed through the air and clipped Buumi. The massive form of the Genoskwa flickered into view for an instant before stepping behind a tree and vanishing. Cyrrus swore, remembering that the creature's corpse had simply disappeared after their last fight, and loosed eldritch blasts at the circling Lysaga as she summoned swarms of biting insects to harass Buumi and Tark.

With another wave of her staff, Lysaga raised several dead werewolves as zombies. The blurred shapes from the town's edge rushed in and resolved into aberrant druids — twisted amalgamations of animal parts. One lunged at Patches as she landed gracefully from her fall. She dodged and counterattacked viciously. Two more druids clambered onto the animated hut, one ripping bits of wood from the stump to spawn a swarm of twig-blights. On the crucifix, Ophelia pulsed with energy, turned ethereal, and sank beneath the mud.

Lysaga hurled a fireball. Again Fëanon raised his staff, smashing the fiery orb from the air in a shower of sparks and embers. The witch screamed in rage and blasted Cyrrus with cold. Noting Fëanon breathing heavily from the effort of repeated counterspells, Cyrrus struck his Staff of Power against the wood of the hut. The diamond tip flashed with azure light and a shimmering globe of invulnerability encased him, Buumi, Tark, and Fëanon.

Patches kicked her druid's legs out and rushed for the hut but slipped on the mossy roots and fell into the mud. She made a disgusted sound, regained her footing, whirled on the recovering druid, and shot it in the face with her flintlock pistol. Its head exploded. Gundren charged in with Gwen — and a boulder from the Genoskwa smashed into the dwarf, knocking him senseless. The beast's concealing magic flickered, betrayed by the water rippling beneath its feet.

Buumi and Tark engaged a fourth druid through swarms of biting insects. A set of slashing claws reached through the window for Fëanon but missed. Ophelia rose through the floor beneath Cyrrus and whispered enchanted words of sleep into his ear — not knowing that his pact with Shar made him incapable of sleep. Cyrrus turned to the night hag, entirely unfazed, and cocked an eyebrow. Ophelia recoiled in shock.

Gundren hauled himself from the water, bleeding and swearing, loaded birdshot into his thundercannon, and shredded two insect swarms. Freed, Tark closed on Baba Lysaga. She had circled to put the hut between herself and the group. Tark shadowstepped to the crucifix, launched himself in a mighty leap, and smashed into the floating skull with Ashbringer — cleaving it in two. Lysaga fell screaming from her perch as Tark sailed past on his momentum.

As the witch plummeted through the air, the animated hut — on which half the group stood while the other half sheltered beneath its legs — shuddered ominously and began to move.
