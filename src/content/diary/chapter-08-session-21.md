Snorbul finishes up repairing the bathroom in the townhouse after a few hours of work.  Oddly, he has a pile of leftover rock pieces which he just piles in a corner and puts some flowers (from Doc) on top.

Unbeknownst to Snorbul, he repaired the bathroom to the scale of a Deep gnome, and not the original dimensions...

Satisfied with a job well done, Snorbul feels like he has to make a good impression with his new friends and help Tark out, so he hits the town looking for a way to cheer up the Monk.

He wanders for about an hour, noting the occasional argument or scuffle in the market place, and ends up over at the **Shattered Spire**.

Entering the fighting pit area, Snorbul is entranced by the sights and smells, seeing an Orc/Goblin team slaying a group of Giant scorpions.

The crowd cheers them on and the Deep gnome beelines towards to the bookies for gambling.

Approaching a grey-bearded Duergar, Snorbul puts his money down on the next fight - A battle with **Bolekk Barrison Del Armgo **the same Drow noble the group is slated to fight the next day.

Not realizing that he had placed a bet, and was not due to actually fight the Elf, Snorbul leaps into the ring after taking his pants off (for the freedom of movement).

The crowd is shocked (the previous bout having been cleared away) at this half naked Deep Gnome with a massive axe (yes, Axe) leaping to the sands of the arena.

The Duergar bookie rushes over and looks into the arena, yelling at Snorbul, explaining the mix up, and demanding he put pants back on.

Snorbul thought he was signing up to fight the Drow and still wishes to do that, the Duergar rushes away to ask Bolekk if he will fight the Gnome.

Across the arena, one of the large doors opens and three Drow start to walk out before they are stopped by the Duergar and informed of the situation.

The lead Drow, encased in ornate Plate armor, sleek and with no visible gaps, a chain wrapped around his Torso and a Longsword on his hip, grins at Snorbul and nods.

To the roar of the crowd, Bolekk advances into the Arena, placing his helm on his head and Snorbul steadies himself and the Elf whips his weapons through a showy routine.

A gong sounds after each has been introduced and they rush at one another, the Drow sprinting forward quickly to engage, casting Faerie Fire on the Deep gnome and lining him in harmless green flame.

Snorbul leaps a good twelve feet off the ground, coming down with a massive chop, the Drow barely deflecting it and sparks being thrown up from the heavy armor.

Responding in a flurry, Bolekk jabs at Snorbul with sword, the cuts burning the small Barbarian with poison.  Whipping his other hand out, the chain unwraps from Bolekk's torso and darts out, a mace head at its end crackling with lightning and striking Snorbul in the side of the head.

Snorbul gets control of his spasming muscles and fights back, though already smarting badly from the poisoned cuts of the Longsword.

The Drow laughs in his helm and lays into the Barbarian again, the poisoned blade burning badly.  The electrified chain-mace strikes Snorbul again and he's knocked to the ground, everything going dark...

Some time later, consciousness returns to the Deep Gnome and he awakes in pain.

Looking around, he sees a Duergar cleric finishing up a healing spell.  The cleric throws Snorbul his coin, including a little bonus from the Drow as he was impressed by the Gnome's Strength.

Bruised and bloodied, Snorbul takes his coin, drinks a massive amount of beer, and then heads back out into the town, still looking for a gift for Tark...

Meanwhile, in Bilrigger's Sanctum the group splits with Tark and Patches rushing from the hidden home, out into The Whorlstone Caverns in pursuit of the Dimension Door-ing Warlock, the only remaining minion of Milgre in the area.

Tark catches a whiff of the warlock and they begin to track her, rushing as fast as they possibly can in the direction of the scents, stealth be damned.

Hitting a fork in the tunnels, Patches investigates and notes the tracks not on the floor, but on the walls and ceiling - a Spider-Climb to try and throw them off.  Knowing what to look for, they pursue.

Enacting his blindfold, Tark notes the Planar cracks they have been seeing throughout the Underdark.

Completely eschewing stealth though, Tark is easily heard by the fleeing Warlock and just as they enter a small chamber, they see the female Derro, clad in Black leather armor and with a blood-red hood covering her head vanish in another Dimension Door spell.

Cursing their ill fortune, Patches and Tark reluctantly return back to Bilrigger's hideout and the two Myconid Sprouts Patches left behind.

In the meantime, Cirrus has rushed into the basement if the Sanctum and found the corpse of the Warlock of Ceregorach. 

The Warlock's head has been cleanly split in two, sliced up through the jaw, cutting the Green Molar in half.  Cirrus quickly takes in the rest of the chamber, barely noting the workshop and torture racks with three dead victims.

The blood pooling around the dead Warlock is congealed and old, whatever killed him happened hours ago...

He carries the corpse of Bilrigger up into the foyer and shows it to Droki, who is immediately cowed into accepting a ceremony to dedicate himself to Selune, for the promise of power from the Moon Goddess.

Cirrus begins the hour-long ritual, Droki somewhat reluctantly going along with it.

Fey'Anon and Gundren begin to search the abode.

The two Myconid Sprouts continue to watch in silence, the small 2ft creatures occasionally puffing out small clouds of spores at one another.

Much of the place has been destroyed and looted, the signs of a previous battle from before they arrived are obvious, the pools of blood being congealed and cold.

The two of them determine that there are two secret rooms flanking the foyer, but are clearly trapped and warded.

Fey approaches the first and begins to look over the warding glyph - one of Petrification.  He shatters the magic but finds the lock behind it to be intricate and decides to wait for Patches to return.

Moving through the area, Fey'Anon does find a small triangular cut of a silken robe that he believes could be from a sleeve, he tags it with the relevant information and sequesters it away before moving on to the Corpse of Rilka, slain by Tark.

Looking over the headless corpse, he picks up a bag of loose coins and a potion of Expeditious Retreat and begins to identify a magical breastplate on the corpse.

Back in the main room, Patches has returned and begun working on the locks behind the glyphed door.  She's rarely come across such complicated machinery and it takes her a while due to the sheer number of false locks and mechanisms, but she finally unlocks the final mechanism and the stone slab slides away revealing a small vault of treasure.

Hearing the sliding stone wall and fearing that his Rogue friend will take all the good stuff, Fey quaffs the potion of Expeditious Retreat, throws the breastplate to Gundren and rushes back to the Foyer in time to see Patches enter a chamber the size of a large walk-in closet.

Within they are greeted with a small treasure trove - 4 chests of coins trapped with glyphs, a Platinum tea-set on velvet pillows covered in contact poison and a glass display case containing a massive Red-Dragon horn, the tip capped in gold with a red sling and red wax capping the open end of the horn.

Investigating each carefully, Fey notes a Planeshift on the glass of the Display case. 

Patches defeats the contact poison carefully with the mystical power of gloves.

Hurt and unwilling to risk himself for treasure, Fey backs up and begins to summon unseen servants to trigger the glyphs, dispelling them as they recharge to avoid any potential backlash.

It takes time, but they break through the defending magic and loot the chests of coin easily, depositing them with the wand, in Sundabar.

Fey smashes the glass panel protecting the Dragon horn and takes the treasure for himself, the 4ft Horn a deep burgundy, fading to black at the tips (though covered in gold).

He and Patches move across the room to the other chamber to begin again and note a scuffle ocurring between Tark and Droki.

They grab the corpse of Rilka to throw into the Glyph of Petrification, "Disarming" it as the body falls, shattering into stone chunks.

The monk, incensed by the betrayal from Kenshi and the ever-looming threat of Orcus and his minions has been questioning the poor Derro since Cirrus finished his ceremony.

The snap of bone distracts Patches and she sees Tark snap the Derro's arm.  Cirrus heals it, but he snaps the other and Patches rushes forward to splint it and try and clam her monk friend.

Tark gets from Droki that the Council of Savants are made up of many, many Warlocks with patrons ranging from Archfey, to Demons and Devils.  They work together when its convenient, but otherwise will stab one another in the back.

Tark asks where he can find more information on the minions of Orcus and Droki says the only place would be **O'Alla**, the Beholder mediator for the Savants - the one they already questioned.

Frustrated by this dismal place, Tark storms out of the Sanctum and into the nearby tunnels.

He begins to head back the way the group came, back to the Savant meeting chambers but stops when he nears the fungal pools where the dancing Myconids were.

He hears a cacophony of voices.

Getting closer, Tark slips into the cavern and sees a large group of Demons, a mix of multiheaded Barlgura's and Chasme demons discussing their plans.

Listening, Tark determines that the demons are gathering in the caverns below, looking for a way up into the city.

He returns to the group to tell them what he has seen.

Though it takes significant time and effort, Fey and Patches work their way through unlocking and disarming the other treasure vault.  Inside they find a cursed necklace of a massive Golden tooth, a set of Rotheskin moccasins another set of coin chests....and a massive portrait of Ceregorach.

As Patches nears the portrait, it begins to slowly move, reaching from the canvas to grab her.

She backs away quickly, and then further thinking on it, loots the room and avoids the painting altogether.

Droki meanwhile is whimpering nearby, cradling his broken arms, despondent and rejected, no longer having ANY warlock powers after the ritual by Cirrus.

During the looting of the place, Cirrus has returned to the basement chamber and cut an eye from the decapitated head of Bilrigger.  He plops it in a vial of alcohol and begins to think.

Depressed and feeling like a failure, Cirrus sits there for many minutes.

Eventually, he makes his way back to the foyer, just as Tark enters and recounts the issue up ahead with the demons.

The two of them, the saddest of the party, begin to shuffle out of the Sanctum and back toward the Fungal cave.

Patches and Gundren join them, but Fey'Anon stays behind, fascinated by the moving painting of Ceregorach trying to stretch from the canvas.

Cirrus eventually goes back to check on him, Patches unwilling to tell him why Fey remained.

Cirrus approaches the small vault and stops, eyes going wide as he sees the painting of his old master - a saggy skinned, thin creature with drooping pale flesh and massive, milky eyes, it's jaw far too large and wide and filled with thousands of jagged teeth.

Cirrus rushes forward and yanks Fey back to "safety"

The two of them though decide to remain and study the painting.  The others let them and begin to return to the city above.

Droki ends up fleeing into the tunnels, away from the group, though Patches convinces him to return to them for more healing, and to discuss the ex-warlock's future.  He agrees reluctantly.

Patches, Tark and Gundren make it back to the Fungal cavern, expecting Demons, but the group Tark saw earlier is nowhere to be found and they continue on.

Though it takes the better part of two hours, they ascend without incident back to the Savant chambers and beyond, out into the city proper and back to the Townhouse.

As they go, Patches tries to talk to Tark.  She tells him that she knows what it's like to lose a master and family member.  

Her brother Marzell was her teacher and her only friend, who was killed by their mother.  She empathizes with Tark but warns him not to lose himself to vengeance or darkness.  

Feeling awkward sharing so much information and feelings, Patches rushes ahead of her friends for a while to let her embarrassment fade.

Tark gets her attention and pulls out The Artifact, handing it to Patches saying he cannot be trusted.  Patches asks why she would be any better but agrees, taking it until Tark is ready to carry it again.

To try and distract from the handoff, Gundren ignites his cannon and waves it about, nearby civilians watching quickly rushing away.

Exhausted, they all head in to rest, Patches checking the Drow embassy and noting guards from House Baenre, Fey-Branche, Barrison Del Armgo and Xorlarrin.

Gundren immediately heads to bed.

Tark beelines toward his room but stops as Snorbul sits up on the couch, addressing the beleaguered monk.

Snorbul takes out his gift for Tark.

A small Cave-bear cub on a rope is walked from around the back of the couch.  About the same size as Tark and incredibly fuzzy, with massive dark eyes and strange floppy skin between its limbs and a big bushy tail, the creature looks more like a monstrous flying squirrel than a bear.

The creature rolls on the ground adorably and Patches rubs its belly, it lets out little chirps of happiness.

Tark steps around the creature and walks to his room, the Cub following but Tark closes the door before it can enter.

A few moments later, the door opens enough to let it inside and the Cub joins Tark.

Patches retires for the night showing Mr. Pickles her new ornate platinum tea set and having him brew up a calming cup of Tea.

Cirrus and Fey are alone in the creepy and destroyed sanctum.

Wishing to rest, but not here, Fey extends his senses and feels the lack of Wild-Magic in the area, the sanctum is shielded and would work as a launching point.

Unwilling to leave the powerful painting, Fey teleports the item to the vaults in Sundabar and then follows with a Teleportation circle, bringing Cirrus with him back to the surface.

Leaving the Underdark, a great mental weight immediately lifts from the two of them.

The difference is so profound that neither of them can pretend that its natural.

Greeted in the guild teleportation room by a smiling face and a glass of sparkling wine, it's good to be back amongst friendly races.

The two of them head through the bustling Dwarven undercity, the difference between Sundabar and Gracksuluth even more striking.

There's no choking smog here.  The laughter of happy people and the sounds of performers and music reaches their ears.  Here, there is no sulfurous stench.  It is a place of happiness and homeliness, not repression and industry.

They pass the massive lava-pool of the Everfire, feeling the intense heat not as oppressive, but as a lifegiving warmth.

Arriving at the bank they are seen quickly, though Goldhold is not available to see them currently.

They inform the clerk of their issue with the magical painting and the Dwarf is a little taken aback that they would bring it here.

They mention that they probably want to find a way to destroy it, to which the Clerk asks why they don't just throw it in the Everfire?

They ask the Clerk to look into that and then take their leave, heading to the Uppercity to see the stars.

Taking the short elevator ride, they arrive in the chill, early springtime air of the Uppercity, a crescent moon greeting them amongst the glittering stars.

Cirrus walks a little ways, finding a nice bench and parking it there, staring up at the moon, his heart lifting.

Fey'Anon bids his friend goodnight and walks the newly constructed streets, the city in much better condition since the last time they were here; the industrious Dwarves working quickly to rebuild.

Asking directions the Wizard makes his way over to an Elven inn, ordering good elven food and renting the nicest room they have available, a warm bath waiting for him upstairs...
