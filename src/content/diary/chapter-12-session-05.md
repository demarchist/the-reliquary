The group is brought into the villa and made comfortable in the courtyard.

Hamda and her mother engage in a small argument, ending with Hamda storming off to her room and Lady Taurus going to talk with her

Milling around, the group notes a fountain of water - an extravagance in this place and obscene show of wealth and a number of guards and servants.

They avail themselves of the water.

They note again the number of personnel this one woman seems to have.

More than a place of this size would warrant too.

The group inquires and discovers that House Taurus is not as wealthy as they used to be and have had to downsize recently.

Buumi heads to the washroom to freshen up and change into his noblemans garb.

Cirrus meanwhile has been ingratiating himself with his host at every turn.

Hors d'oeuvres are served and the group digs in to an array of strange, but delicious foods.

The group is shown into a dining room, pale stone walls and rich wooden furniture.

Lady Taurus re-appears wreathed in expensive silks and looking the part of the hostess.

Cirrus schmoozes over dinner, though several of the group are wary of Lady Taurus and relegate themselves to the other side of the table (away from Liara too).

Buumi re-appears looking quite gaudy and even wearing metal, much to the Lady's shock.

Liara tries to cover, saying that we are from a far off city and from something called "The Crucible"

Over the course of the evening, the Lady reveals that she is not hosting us out of the kindness of her heart.

She is appreciative of the return of her daughter and has arranged another method of transportation for the girls journey to Iyum.

She is willing to house the group in the Villa while she travels with her daughter, provided they accept a paying job from House Taurus - she needs a ship found.

House Taurus is down to its last merchant ship and it has now gone missing in the nearby reef.

The Pirate band *Demon Claws *are suspected.* *

The group agrees to look into it, though wonders if maybe they are being set up to loot someone else's ship under false pretenses and get blamed as outlanders.

Snorbul is the real reason the group intends to go as the Gnome reminds them of his vision of the legendary Sovereign Glue that can be found out on the reef.

The group decides to find out if Lady Taurus is setting them up.

Cirrus is choked out again that night as many of the group stay up drinking fermented Bug nectar.

Buumi manages to heal Cirrus's bruised neck, much to his delight, confirming that if his actions still worship helm, prayers will be answered.

Eventually everyone sleeps and the next day the group heads into the city, heading to the Harbor-master of the trade district.

Checking up on House Taurus, they do find that the missing ship is registered to her house.  She seems to be telling the truth.

With that confirmed, the group heads through the city toward the Fisherman's Wharf, where a cheaper ship has been rented by House Taurus to ferry the group out to the reef to look for the missing merchant ship.

On their way, the group heads almost directly past the Critereon, the famous arena of the city.

hearing the roar of the cheering crowd, the group can't help but go to look inside…
