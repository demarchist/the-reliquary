## Into the Manor

Buumi stood beneath the dragon statue, turning the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind over in his hands. Tark faded into the mist — gone and forgotten in the way Barovia allowed — and Gundren phased into existence in his place, heaving the damaged Gwen onto the back of a mount before joining the group at the statue with appropriate awe.

The manor was vast and decrepit. Four storeys of fortified grandeur, its eastern wing heavily collapsed, the rain running ceaselessly through ancient gutters. Patches scaled the exterior to the second floor and peered through an arrow slit into the main hall — ancient furniture and mouldering decoration throughout. Below, Fëanon and Gundren investigated the dragon statue and found a depleted trap. Cyrrus marched up to the front door and knocked one of the massive dragon-headed knockers. The statue's jaws opened and blew a gust of stale cold — the cone of frost long since spent. Gundren snatched the blue gemstone core from the closing jaws a split second before losing his arm. The double doors groaned open.

As Cyrrus and Buumi entered the main hall, a great shadow flickered across the space and the soft echo of leathery wings whispered above them.

## Horrors and Hauntings

The exploration fragmented across multiple floors. Patches found the collapsed eastern section draped in massive webs — hundreds of tiny spiders scuttling across thick sheets, with a dozen monstrous specimens lurking deeper. She shuddered and climbed past them to the third floor.

Fëanon discovered a side room containing a large black sarcophagus. Cyrrus, growing increasingly unnerved, began sending unseen servants to scout ahead. One was devoured by a zombie in the servants' quarters — Cyrrus guessed its position and destroyed the creature with an eldritch blast through the wall. Buumi summoned his glowing hammer to orbit the main hall for light.

The sarcophagus held a mummy, trapped but disarmed. In the ground-floor wine pantry, Gundren found a wounded Dusk Elf named Savid hiding behind the last cask. The elf had been chased inside by Needleblights and taken splinter-shards to his side. After Buumi healed him, Savid asked if they had seen a missing Vistani girl named Arabelle. They had not, but promised to look.

Upstairs, Patches came face to face with a ghostly apparition on the third floor. She kept her composure and headed for the stairs — only to find, on the second-floor landing, a marble pillar draped in black silk. No traps. She lifted the cloth slowly and it disintegrated in her hands, revealing her own severed head on the plinth, crawling with spiders. A voice screamed in her mind: *"TRAITOR!"*

Buumi found her standing rigid before the pillar, staring. He put a hand on her shoulder. She flinched — then snatched the hammer from his belt and destroyed the marble in a screaming frenzy. Breathing hard, she handed the hammer back without meeting his eyes. When they passed a curtained rod with more black silk further down the hall, she grabbed the hammer again and smashed that too.

## The Dragon's Request

In the dining hall, Gundren disabled a glyph that would have activated two stone golem statues. Cyrrus, who had gone ahead alone, entered the chapel where three revenants knelt in prayer. They stood and drew their swords. Thinking fast, Cyrrus invoked the name of Argynvost and told them the dragon's spirit had spoken to his companions. The revenants paused inches from his throat, demanded he leave, and directed him to their grandmaster — Horngaard. Cyrrus fled the building at speed.

Outside, he found a large chest at the base of the steps that had not been there before, a parchment resting on top. The letter contained a single sentence: *"I want my hat back."* An arm smashed out of the chest — one of Gowain's shadow monks, hidden inside, seized Cyrrus by the throat and began landing devastating blows. Cyrrus summoned a pillar of hellfire that forced the monk to release him, then teleported to safety and hit it with eldritch blasts while Buumi charged through the front doors and battered it to death with his hammer.

Above them, on the third floor, Fëanon and Gundren had found a locked study containing a single chair and a large torn painting. Gundren used his artificing skills to mend the canvas, and the ghost of Argynvost materialised — the human form of the silver dragon, long dead.

Argynvost told them he had guarded a prison of evil known as the Amber Temple, high on the slopes of Mt. Ghakis, which also contained a vast repository of arcane knowledge. Fëanon's eyes lit up. The dragon asked a favour: when Strahd had killed him, the vampire lord had taken his bones as a trophy to Castle Ravenloft. If the group would recover them and lay them to rest in the mausoleum here, Argynvost could finally sleep — and his knights would be freed from their curse. To sweeten the offer, the dragon promised the location of a treasure hoard Strahd had never found. He pressed a platinum coin into Fëanon's hand as he faded and whispered that there was much, much more.

## Ezmerelda

As Fëanon and Gundren descended, the rest of the group was greeted by a newcomer. Patches spotted her first from the wall — an armed and armoured Vistani woman galloping toward them. She leapt from her horse, grinned broadly, and introduced herself as Ezmerelda.

She was striking — beautiful, clearly battle-hardened, and immediately charming. Buumi appeared instantly smitten. Patches rolled her eyes and began picking small stones from the wall to throw at him, the pebbles pinging off his armour to no effect. Cyrrus disguised himself as a beautiful woman and draped an arm across Buumi's shoulders, earning a scowl.

Ezmerelda explained she was being pursued but had wanted to meet the group, having heard of their exploits against Gowain. She was searching for her master, the vampire hunter Rudolph Van Richten. She had found his camp in an old tower once owned by a dead lich, but Van Richten himself remained elusive. The group mentioned they had seen him in Vallaki. She sighed — the town refused to admit any Vistani.

Her pursuit caught up: three Vistani riders led by a man named Arrigal, demanding Ezmerelda answer for horse theft. She laughed in his face, slapped the horse on the rump to send it back to him, and tossed a gold coin after it. The group made clear that a fight would be unwise. Arrigal left, promising retribution. Ezmerelda thanked them and departed for Van Richten's tower, trading information about Argynvostholt's state before she went.

## The Keepers of the Feather

The group rode back to Vallaki without incident and settled into the Bluewater Inn for the evening. The common room was empty. Urwen served them a meal and, when pressed, seemed unsurprised that the ghost of the dragon had spoken to them.

The group told him they knew he was not what he appeared to be. With some coaxing and expert persuasion from Cyrrus, Urwen revealed his secret. He shifted before their eyes — his form rippling into a kenku-like ravenform before returning to human.

He reintroduced himself as Urwen of the Keepers of the Feather, an order of wereravens within Barovia sworn to protect the people from Strahd.
