## The Crossroads

The group gathered themselves at the misty crossroads, still reeling from the death of Kangaxx. The golden lich was no more, but the air here tasted wrong — damp, cold, and heavy with something none of them could name. They collected what remained of Kangaxx and turned toward the nearby tavern, the only sign of civilisation in the grey landscape.

Along the way, Patches spied a golden dragonscale glinting on the muddy ground. She reached for it, but the moment her fingers drew close, a vision slammed into her mind — the silhouette of a gargantuan platinum dragon, vast beyond comprehension. The scale was not meant for her. She withdrew her hand and moved on. Tark came next and picked it up without hesitation. Meditating on the warm metal, he felt a certainty settle into his bones: this was his to carry, and it mattered.

## The Vistani Inn

The tavern sat within a silver ring etched into the earth — a ward against evil spirits. Inside, the group met Ivonova, a middle-aged Vistani woman who ran the most remote inn in Barovia. She brought food and drink and told them of her people, of the curse that held this valley in its grip, and of the tragic fate of Count Strahd Von Zarovich. Exhausted, most of the group retired early, but a troupe of Vistani traders arrived and the evening took a turn toward commerce.

Patches attempted to lift a map of the valley from one of the traders, only to be caught mid-swipe. Rather than escalate, the group proposed a wager — a game of dice. Win, and the map was theirs. Lose, and they would leave immediately. The game was tense, the cheating was subtle, and the party won. The night continued in fine spirits, with JmJm enticing a large Vistani man and an attractive younger woman to his rooms, because of course he did.

The next morning, a letter waited for them — addressed to the group by name, requesting they travel to the village of Barovia to aid the Burgomaster. The group resolved to find the village, then seek out Strahd himself. Perhaps they could negotiate their way free of this prison. Tark and Buumi liked the idea of bargaining with a vampire about as much as they liked the weather, but they agreed to at least try diplomacy before violence.

## The Mists

Heading down the road, the group mounted up and rode toward the valley. After a few miles, they came upon a monumental gateway — iron gates a hundred feet high, flanked by two decapitated statues of knights. Movement flickered in an arrow slit, but nothing else stirred.

Before committing to the gate, someone pointed out that they had taken everyone's word about being trapped here without actually testing it. The group turned back to the misty border, now less than a hundred feet behind them and drifting closer. Fëanon, ever the empiricist, spurred his spectral steed directly into the fog.

A second of hoofbeats. Then silence.

A few heartbeats later he burst back through the mist, dishevelled and haunted. It took him a moment to recognise his companions — from his perspective, he had been wandering a featureless void for a hundred years. To everyone else, mere seconds had passed. The group stared at the mist in horror.

Tark's eyes adjusted to the supernatural, and he saw them — misty spirits clawing at an invisible barrier within the fog, desperately trying to escape the valley. Patches looked skyward and for one terrible instant perceived something that nearly broke her mind: a black mass of infinite tendrils descending from above, snaking into the valley to touch a thousand things. One such tendril was coiled around the Tavern of Doors, preventing it from opening. She shut her eyes before the sight could drive her mad.

## Blood on the Road

The only way was forward. Through the massive gates, deeper into the valley. Farther along the path the stench of death hit them and they found a mauled corpse clutching a letter. Wolves howled in the distance. The letter was nearly identical to the one from the inn — except this version was a warning to stay away, not an invitation. Something was playing games with them.

The group pressed on, hearing more howls. Investigating the treeline, they spotted a crucified figure affixed to a tree a hundred feet off the road. Tark shadowstepped directly to it and found himself face to face with his own body — strung up and dissolved by chemicals. The shock of staring into his own dead face brought a crushing wave of paranoia. He felt watched. When the others arrived, the body melted into mist and vanished. Patches peered deeper into the forest and caught the impression of a massive humanoid shape — easily ten feet tall — watching them through the fog with a flash of golden eyes.

They returned to the road at speed.

About two miles from the village, the crack of flintlock weapons echoed through the trees. Rounding a bend, they found hulking, hide-clad barbarians and a shaman locked in battle with a squad of mounted Barovian pistoliers, a ghostly winged woman presiding over the carnage from above. Not knowing which side to favour, they charmed and questioned the shaman — the barbarians were here to die in glorious combat, adorning themselves with grisly trophies. JmJm split the battlefield with a massive illusory chasm. Buumi rode in atop Aurora and hurled a javelin at the shaman, only to miss and skewer one of the riders instead. The group entangled, sickened, and blasted both sides in quick succession. In seconds, everyone was dead or dying.

Buumi and Tark looked on in confusion at the pile of corpses, unsure what had just happened. Cyrrus calmly walked to one of the fallen riders and revived him with a touch of lunar light. The man's wounds sealed and he gasped back to life — then drew a knife with crazed eyes and attacked. Patches stepped behind him and put him down. Her cursed dagger fed on his soul, turning him to ash.

The group stood among the remains of the ill-fated battle, scavenging what they could: two working flintlocks, a fine sabre, halfplate, hide armour, and assorted weapons. The valley of Barovia had greeted them with blood. Somehow, none of them were surprised.
