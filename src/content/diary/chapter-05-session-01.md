The group takes the lay of the land.  Gathering up the remains of Kangaxx, the group heads to the nearby tavern.

On the way, Patches spies a golden dragonscale on the ground which she goes to pick up.  As she reaches for it, she gets a strong impression that it is not for her, she sees a flash of a gargantuan Platinum dragon in her mind and moves on.  Tark then reaches the scale and picks it up.  Meditating on it, he gets a strong sense he should be the one to have the scale and that it's important.

Just before the group gets to the tavern, they notice a silver ring surrounding the place, warding it against evil spirits.  The group heads inside and meet Ivonova a middle aged Vistani woman running the most remote Inn of Barovia.  Ivonova makes the group comfortable, bringing food and drink and telling them of her people, the curse of Barovia and the sad fate of Count Strahd Von Zarovich.  Exhausted, many of the group head to bed, just as a group of Vistani traders enter the tavern for the night.   The group begins haggling and perusing their wares.  At one point, Patches attempts to lift a map of the Valley, only to be caught by a Vistani.  The group decides to ratched up the stakes and play dice for the map if they win, or all leave if they lose.  After a tense game of dice (and some subtle cheating), the party wins and the fine evening continues.  Eventually, the entire party retires for the night, with JmJm enticing a large Vistani man and an attractive younger woman to his rooms.

The next morning the group finds a letter awaiting them, addressed to the group personally, calling for them to head to the village of Barovia to aid the Burgomaster of the town.  The group decides to make their way to the town and then find Strahd and discuss their imprisonment in this plane - maybe they can bargain their way free?  Both Tark and Buumi are less than happy about bargaining with a Vampire, but they agree to at least try talking.

Heading off down the road to Barovia, the group mounts up/hops on a shared mount and head down into the valley of Barovia.  After travelling a few miles, the group comes up to a massive set of gates, over a hundred feet high, with two massive decapitated statues of knights flanking a massive Iron gate.  They see the flicker of movement in an arrow slit, but see and sense no more than that.   Realizing that they had taken everyone's word about being trapped here, before committing to the gate the group decides to return to the border and test the mists.  Turning around, they find the misty border only a hundred feet or so behind them  and slowly drifting closer.  Fey'Anon gallops his magical steed directly into the mist and after a second or so of hoofbeats, all goes silent.   A few seconds pass and suddenly he bursts forth from the mist, a little disheveled and a haunted look in his eyes.  It takes him a second, but Fey remembers his group - he has not seen them in 100 years.  To Fey's perspective, he had been wandering a misty void for 100 years, but to all others only seconds have transpired.  The group looks in horror at the mists and Tark suddenly sees misty forms and spirits clawing at an invisible wall in the mists, trying to get free of the land but unable to do so.   Patches looks into the sky and for a brief instant, thinks she sees a massive, infinitely huge, black mass of tendrils, snaking down into the valley to touch thousands of things.  One such tendril is snaked around The Tavern of Doors preventing it from opening.  Patches closes her eyes before the very sight of the thing drives her insane…

The group decides the only way is forwards, to head to the Village of Barovia and go from there.  The group heads through the massive gates.  Farther along the path, they smell the stench of death and Decay, looking around, they find a mauled corpse, holding a letter.  Wolves howl in the distance.  The letter on the body seems to be very similar to the one they got at the Inn, with the exception that this one is a warning to stay away and not an invitation like they got in the Inn.  Unsure what it all means, the group continues along, hearing more wolf howls.  The group decides to investigate the nearby forest for signs of wolves.  As their eyes turn from the road, they all see a crucified form  affixed to a tree about 100ft off the road.  Tark teleports directly to it and is brought face to face with himself, strung up on a tree and melted from chemicals.  Face to face with his own death, he is suddenly struck by an intense feeling of paranoia and feels like he is being watched.  As the rest of the group gets to him, the body in the tree melts into mist.  Patches peers off further into the forest and sees an impression of a huge, 10ft humanoid shape in the mists, watching them with a flash of golden eyes.  The group makes their way quickly back to the road and ride from the area in the direction of Barovia.

About two miles from the village, the group hears the sounds of battle, punctuated by cracks of thunder from flintlock weapons.  Coming around a bend, they see a number of hulking, hide clad barbarians and a Shaman battling a group of mounted Barovian Pistoliers.   Looking up into the sky, they see a ghostly winged woman presiding over the battle.  Not knowing which side to get involved in, the Shaman is charmed and questioned - the barbarians are here to die in glorious combat and indeed, adorn themselves with grisly trophies.  The riders are forced to swerve their mounts away from a massive illusionary crack that appears, summoned by JmJm as he splits the battlefield.  Buumi rides in atop Aurora, his mount and throws a Javelin at the Shaman that had knocked a rider from his horse, only to miss and hit the rider...  The riders are then pinned between two groups of barbarians and the Shaman creates a mass of thorned vines to tear at them, just as the group casts a zone of entangling plants, and  Cirrus brings about an are of radiant sickness.  In Seconds, the whole combat is over, with both parties dead, or dying.  Not sure what happened, Buumi and Tark look on in confusion at all the death with Buumi aghast at the results.  Cyrrus calmy walks over to one of the dead riders and revives him with a glowing touch -the mans wounds seal up and he gasps a ragged breath.  His eyes go wide and he pulls a knife, crazed and attacks the group.  Patches comes up behind him and puts the insane man out of his misery, her cursed dagger feeding on his soul and turning him to ash.

The combat over, the group sees what can be salvaged, with JmJm getting two working Flintlocks, +1 Sabre, a complete set of Halfplate +1 and Hide armor +1 and numerous pieces of other weapons and armor.  The group is then left surrounded by the remains of the ill fated battle.
