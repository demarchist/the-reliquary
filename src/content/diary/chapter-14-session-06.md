The group is at the Inn *Her Gift *deciding to pack up and head out toward Yggward 

Feanon notes Tark reading a book named Tres Litches and scanning over his shoulder, sees the names; Kangaxx, Zhengyi and Vecna

As they ready to leave, Feanon goes pale and clammy and realizes that he can feel the Illithid he noticed in the city

It is downstairs at this very Inn

He decides to confront it and leads the rest of the group downstairs to the common area

The wizard takes the lead, with everyone else hanging back in case their friend needs them

He sees the Mind Flayer at the bar, seemingly intent on the barkeep - a gorgeous androgynous statuesque drow in flowing purple robes

Feanon is greeted and invited to the bar by the Illithid telepathically as he approaches

The wizard is taken off guard at the seemingly friendly, or at least amicable, attitude of the thing

Feanon goes to the bar and orders a drink that comes with a memory of a sunset as you imbibe and he notes the Illithid respond to the emotions generated by the drink

Seemingly at ease, the rest of the group approaches (save Patches who is doing Alchemy upstairs) and get memory enhanced drinks

The Illithid reacts to the energies of the group as they experience these strange, extraplanar concoctions

The Wizard attempts to wrestle information from the Illithid with Detect Thoughts, but due to the aggressive action, the spell is counterspelled by the Powers That Be in the city.

Feanon switches to intuition and gets a sense of what is happening and questions the Illithid

It says that it’s name is *The Euphoria One Feels When Besting an Inferior*

The group shortens the name to Euphoria

The Mind Flayer is a recorder of information and emotion, seeking out memories and data to return to the Colony for The Long Sleep between universal cycles

Feanon inquires about the sleep and it turns out the Mind Flayers don't think Atropos and Orcus can be stopped so they are leaving to hide in the far reaches of the Cosmological background and Hibernate until a new Universe forms

During that hibernation, they will need as much data as possible, so Euphoria is out collecting memories

The group finds this motivation somewhat unthreatening and enjoy their time talking with the thing.

As they begin to wrap up this curiosity the Mind Flayer has one last request - that it can travel with them for a short while to collect a better sense and memory of the interesting group.

Tark remembers that the Githzerai monk he fought was here to hunt this illithid

Wary of a trick or a trap, they extract a binding promise from the Illithid to treat them by the laws of Dokkar even though they venture out to Yggward

Euphoria agrees, promising good behavior

The group heads out from *Her Gift *to the second tier of the city, seeking out Krilin the Drow Ranger that Gundren talked to

They find him in the lodge regaling a group of drinking Gnomes with some tale of daring

He stops and heads over seeing Gundren arrive with a small army of ridiculously well equipped adventurers and a huge grin erupts across his face

The group takes Krilin up on his job of escorting a caravan of treasure to the Yggward crossroad, just before Nidavellir

Krilin thanks the group for coming and promises a mighty reward should they make it to the Crossroads; 1 thing at random from the haul of treasure

The group gladly accept, having seen some of the masterworks being produced for the Dragon Hoards 

The jovial Drow leads them across the city from the Lodge to the back of the lowest tier, to a menagerie of celestial creatures in their stables

Krilin introduces a Celestial Bison named **Youree **

Easily 10ft tall at the shoulder and with sweeping white horns, pearlescent fur and glowing white eyes Krilin ruffles her ears and asks “who’s my best girl?”

And Youree responds with “oh, I am”

JmJm starts and looks shocked and asks the great Bison “You can talk!?”

Youree laughs and begins to walk from her stable, massive treasure chests jingling, heading toward the city exit, calling back for JmJm to catch up 

The sloping tunnels begin a long corkscrew down toward Nidavellir

The group begins their journey to Yggward and the Cathedral of Twilight

The journey is fascinating, with time and space being unnaturally bent or shifted by the nature of the Plane.

Patches notes that much of her Underdark survival sense is thrown off here by the very unnatural place

As they journey, they note that the chaos of the plane increases

Large cracks and crevasses begin to split and sunder the stone of the caverns and tunnels, creating greater and greater rents in the living rock.

With their extensive adventuring expertise, the group descends for seemingly hours without incident

Youree and JmJm hit it off wonderfully and their laughter echoes through the beautiful crystal tunnels

The party is captivated by floating rock and crystal ignoring gravity and creating drifting islands 

The Flora and Fauna here reminds them of the Underdark but more chaotic, seeming to not obey any laws of nature and operating far more off of the emotions and resonance a place invokes or creates

The islands of rock and the rents become severe enough that the group takes to their various means of flying to traverse farther.

The Celestial Bison has no issues traversing the plane and she plods along making small talk, the treasure chests jingling

After some time, the group gets to the edge of a particularly large island of rock and notes the pathway split at a crossroad, with one path turning down the cliff-face and looping down into the rock, and the other leading across a slowly corkscrewing arch of stone, out to another island in the void

Across the arch, built into the floating stone and hanging above a vast nebula-filled starry sky is a grand cathedral of Onyx

The spire of it’s grand tower descends and twists - warped by a black hole far beneath it, floating in the astral sea

The Astral Sea can be seen glimmering all around through the gaps in the cracked rock and floating islands which become more broken up and chaotic in the direction of the other path

This is the crossroads where The Shadowfell, Astral Sea, Svartalfheim and Nidavellir meet

Krilin reappears suddenly, his Greater Invisibility ending and he claps his hands together, thanking the group for the escort.

True to his word, he opens one of the great treasure chests and pulls out an item at random.

He pulls out a glorious looking golden mace with gleaming gemstones set into the head and haft

Krilin groans in dismay as he realizes what he had just promised the group

Gundren reaches out and grabs it and Krilin resists….for a moment before relinquishing the weapon with a sigh and wry smile

He chalks it up to a lucky roll of fate’s dice

It is a newly forged Weapon of Lordly might, a tremendous weapon

Gundren looks into the gleaming gems and sees his reflection wearing the bejeweled crown.

He thinks the Weapon really brings the outfit together.

JmJm and Youree share a tearful goodbye and JmJm promises to visit, or bring her to the Prime Material for a holiday

Krilin and Youree then take the path leading toward the more chaotic floating rocks of Nidavellir, leaving the more solid rock-mass of Svartalfheim “above”

The group looks across the twisting bridge to The Cathedral of Twilight which marks the entrance to Yggward, the Necropolis of the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim

They move across the bridge, adhering to the twisting arch as if Gravity itself moved with them

Patches gets nervous and feels like she’s being watched and goes invisible, using the cloak she got in Al’askar

The group lets out gasps of surprise, thinking she’s finally just become THAT stealthy

As they approach the grand entry of the inverted Cathedral (doing a 360 across the bridge), the great black shimmering doors begin to swing silently in

Pairs of robed elves can be seen moving about the place - one wearing a serene mask of silver, and the other wearing a serious mask of Onyx

They are Clerics of the Twinborn Godesses

The vast cathedral interior is far too large to fit within the structure as seen from the outside, and additionally, does not seem to be inverted within

In the center of the main floor, a vast hole descends to Yggward proper and the Shadowfell

Twelve great mirrors of perfect darkness float by the precipice

Some are attended to by an elf and two priests. The elf touching the mirror and meditating with the Clerics seeming to simply wait nearby

A pair of Clerics approach the new arrivals and Cirrus peels off from the group with no explanation.

They catch a snippet from the clerics calling Cirrus a “Child of Twilight”

He walks some distance away and it is clear he wishes privacy

Patches turns back toward the mirrors and another pair of clerics are standing right next to the group

She bows and greets them and they bow in response, welcoming her by name

They realize that these Clerics are a worshiper of Selune and one of Shar

A flash of light marks the arrival of a Celestial that begins to speak to Cirrus across the chamber, though her shadow is notably dark and intense

Patches says she seeks the blessing of her ancestors to found a new house free of Lolth’s corruption and the Clerics both turn to the mirror and gesture for Patches to approach to claim the blessing of her ancestors

They tell her to reach out and touch the mirror, and visit a dreaming ancestor herself to ask for this blessing.

Patches extends her hand to touch the mirror, but hesitates, looking at her friends

The Clerics then say that her friends are encouraged to touch the mirror and witness

Patches touches it and her friends then follow suit (Cirrus rejoins the group and joins as well)


The vision resolves itself into a sweeping moonlit vista of a grass covered bluff rising up over the steppe.

The bluff is dotted with trees and a henge of elven monoliths caps the pinnacle

Snow gleams off of far off peaks and Tark has a tinge of familiarity, though he cannot place it

The moon shines in the starry sky above, full and gleaming silver, bathing the world in twilight

The party sees a large group of thirty elves, including children rushing up the last dozen feet or so to the Standing Stones atop the bluff with an albino Elk trailing, mounted by an Elven woman galloping to catch up

The woman wields a long silvery glaive with gracefully curving blade and wears long robes of shimmering white silk that flow out behind her as she rides. Moonlight gleams off of delicate armor beneath the robes and her white hair and lilac skin seem to glow under the Moon.

Her eyes are piercing Orange and look just like Patches’

Just as the Elk steps over the threshold of the Standing Stones, a Drow Arcanist within the holy site raises a dome of force around the perimeter and the woman backflips off the Elk as it barely makes it within, the dome of force separating beast and rider

The Elk quickly turns and helplessly frets at the barrier, unable to return to its beloved rider

The arcanist and the woman share a long, mournful look and the woman turns from the hilltop and her fleeing people to look back down the slope

Two massive hulking forms are rushing forward, the moonlight seeming to slide off their cursed and demonic forms

Drider-like with Spider legs and a twisted female Drow body wreathed in purple flame. One arm twists and splits at the wrist into a mass of writhing snake-headed tentacles, in the other hand they grip a long and wicked looking sword that flickers with lightning.

Patches' ancestor raises her Glaive which bursts into holy light and she cries forth a word of power.

The Dome of Force blazes with light and becomes covered in glowing moonlight runes, reinforcing the barrier against the attacking Demons

The Balors let out shrill, mocking laughs and advance

Cirrus feels a familiar presence out in the darkness and a shiver goes up his spine

Patches, suspecting she is about to watch her ancestor’s death, wills herself to intervene, she can’t sit by idly and she finds herself joining the vision in physical form, manifesting next to her ancestor in this “dreamscape”

She summons Eclipse from quicksilver which the ancestor recognizes as Moonfire from Elistraee

The ancient woman smiles and nods at Patches and then looks on in surprise as the rest of the group will themselves to join, materializing to assist in what *should *have been this woman’s final stand.

The group arrays themselves before the gleaming Wall of Force and the ancient elven standing stones to meet the Demon’s charge…
