The group finds themselves in a familiar ancient set of ruins.

The chamber they are in is a copy of the gate platform they just left, but older looking and more weathered, made of white marble and copper instead of black marble and Silver.

Like where they had just left, this chamber is occupied and dead cultists can be seen strewn at the feet of a group of adventurers.

Before the group can really react of register this new place, they act to seal the Ringed Veil and stop the horde of Alghouls from coming through the portal.

Raveel disables the portal and the group turns to better look at the chamber and the group of adventurers now worriedly eyeing them.

Tark moves over to talk with the group, noting not a single metal weapon or affect on the entire group.

They look unique; wearing nothing but hides, shells and bone armor and weapons. Far from looking primitive, many of the armors have intricate layers of chitin and the weapons are expertly lashed into ingenious designs.

 Tark assures them that they are friendly to common folk and enemies of the dark cult that is present here.

The groups leader, a priestess named** Liara**, sighs in relief and confirms that they fight on the same side; against this dark cult.

While this talk is happening, Cirrus strides forward to engage in his customary performance, but stops short, his eyesight blurring and crying Mercury tears.

Others in the party react and approach Cirrus asking him if he’s alright as he looks…wrong.

Suddenly realizing that his illusions are not functioning, Cirrus tries to use other pact magic.  To no avail.

Cirrus is cut off from Selune.

As this dawns on Cirrus, Buumi begins to cough a little and complains of exhaustion.

Cirrus storms to Raveel and begins to beat the man with his quarterstaff, exclaiming that it must the Raveels fault that he cannot contact Selune.

Liara tries to help, revealing that Cirrus must be too far from his reality for the goddess of Selune to have influence in this realm, this is the planet of Gaia.

Cirrus is flabbergasted and appalled at the blasphemy and starts to scream at her.

Buumi who was similarly concerned has his own epiphany and tries to calm Cirrus.

Buumi says that this must be a test - Gods are transcendent and embody a fact of the universe, they cannot simply not exist.  Just because Selune is not her name *here* does not mean the moon goddess is not embodied here under another alias.

For Buumi, his tenants are guardianship, protection and justice.  If he lives his life to the code of a Watcher of Helm, then that act of worship will be enough to connect him to his god.

He asks Liara what god would defend those who cannot defend themselves and she answers **Karthus**** **

Buumi smiles and looks to Cirrus, stating “see, Helm is here, you need only look to find your goddess”.

Cirrus is not having any of it and storms off.

As this is happening, Feanon searches and loots the area while the others begin to setup a camp.

Feanon walks aside and goes to cast his Magnificent Mansion.  The spell fails due to the wards of the teleportation chamber, but one other unexpected thing happens - a massive surge of wild magic erupts into a lighting storm that fills the chamber for ten minutes.

After it subsides, Liara rushes over from her own camp (after being asked for some privacy).

She explains that ever since the Saurians broke the world a thousand years ago, magic and sourcery have been entangled in chaos.

Without proper training, the use of magic results in a Magic Surge creating unpredictable and often dangerous results.  She can teach the group to mitigate it and they eagerly agree.

In addition to this, using Magic results in a cascade of Source Static to nearby metal conductors causing burns.

This is why none of them use Metal gear - it conducts wild magic and sourcery and can get you killed…

The collective party begins to grumble about this, they will go home as soon as possible (if not for Cirrus then simply to have a way home).

With the portal disconnected from Toril though, none of them know the address to dial back.

Gundren finds a half-wrecked machina in the ancient ruins though and brings it back to camp.

After a quick repair, Tark slots in the memory core of the ancient and long dead Saurian and fulfills his promise of a body for the long dead intellect.

Ecstatic, Hasrala swears to help the group get home.

Given enough time to assimilate and repair the damaged mind’s spirit and body, Hasrala says he will have the address to dial the group back to Toril.

Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket, the group discusses other options.

Liara listens in.

The Saurians must have had a library of addresses, Torils address must be stored somewhere.

Liara confirms that the City of Sharza would certainly have a library containing such things, as might the great Library of the Elves (feanon says “*obviously”)*. 

 Additionally, contacting the Ancients (gods) of her world could get them that information.

Cirrus just about explodes on her as she mentions that they should try and communicate with The Ancients.

The rest of the group listens but wonders about Liara’s motive in pushing them toward that route.

She mentions that going on a pilgrimage to each holy temple of The Ancients would bless the group with power, the ability to temper Sourcery and access to the Pilgrim’s Way into the city of Sharza, avoiding an Army of the corrupted dead.

The group mentions the artifact the Saurians used in their murals (pointing to the mural in the current chamber).

Liara confirms that the Artifact’s location is well known - at the Black Pyramid of Barzak in the City of the Dead - Sharza - another reason to go on the Pilgrimage to gain access.

She backs away and the group talk amongst themselves.

Patches, Gwen, Raveel, Thorna, Merrigold and Hasrala will remain behind in this location with one of the communication tablets looted from the cult.

The rest of them will go with Liara to the north, to the City of Ras Alkan, near the Temple of Karthas and then decide their path forward rather than remain without adequate supplies in the mountains.

As the group rests out the evening and into the next day, Liara’s own group returns with supplies, armor and weapons better suited to the climate of Al Askar.

Indeed, even beneath the ground in these ancient ruins, the temperature is severe.

The group dons appropriate attire to not stand out and leaves all their metal behind, in bags of holding (as last resorts) or bundled in non conductive hides and strapped to packs.

Wearing shell, hide and carapace armor, the group looks a little more like natives, though exceedingly pale and un-tanned in comparison.

One glaring exception to this is Cirrus.

Unable to deal with his disconnection from Selune, he is suffering from delusions, thinking and pretending with absolute conviction, that he still has his power and connection…

The group sets out, Liara companions returning to a nearby trading post down the mountain, while Liara takes the group North, through the Red Hills to the nearest city, and closest Temple of the Ancients (and a possible address home).

The group remains wary of Liara, sensing that she seeks to use the group for her own ends and wonders about the Pilgrimage she was so quick to suggest…

The rest of the group remains behind, to try a second avenue to reconnect the Ringed Veil to one back in Toril.

The Red Hills prove to be inhospitable.

The High altitude does nothing for the temperature, rising into the low hundreds over the course of the day.

The group is thankful for the lighter armor and clothing that they have donned.

Liara leads, though many of the group take point, keen on perceiving and being exceptionally wary of this new world.

Two suns glare down from above set in a greenish sky.  The Red rocky hills of this place are baking and the group realizes that water supplies are going to be precious here.

Respite arrives as later that day, the sky clouds over.

Liara warns the group of an impending High Storm and they begin to look for shelter.

They find a small cave to shelter in and watch as the massive sand and dust storm blows through, shimmering Wild Sourcery being released in its passing.

They watch as a blast of magic summons a swarm of locust that consume a nearby patch of plants before being swept off in the storm…

The storm lasts for three hours and blasts the mountainside, causing minor burns and contusions to the group despite the shelter.

Feanon asks how common these magical storms are and Liara says - Common.

Feanon comes to the realization that what happened in the Underdark that fractured Reality, likely happened here in Al Askar just on a planetary scale.

He thinks that he may be able to modify the ritual he developed from Vizeron’s to heal the damage to this world…

Liara is shocked that this is a possibility.

After the worst of the storm has passed, they move to press on before many of the local creatures begin to stir from their own shelter.

The path is hard work, the terrain rocky and the temperatures sweltering.

Buumi has particular trouble, no longer able to rely on the strength of his magical belt, he finds himself quite out of shape and tries to ride the strange beetle-like beast of burden Liara brought to carry supplies.

Later that day, they are forced to turn back and look for another path as they come across a ravine filled with black tar, webbing and spores.

Liara calls it Corruption.

They move on, the delay costing precious time.

The sun begins to get low on the horizon and they begin to think about shelter for the night.

As they do, a tremor in the ground alerts them and Buumi calls a warning just as four large creatures burst forth.

More chitinous and insectoid than their Toril variants, the group recognizes Bulettes and quickly move to battle the creatures.

Having trained with Liara that morning in controlling Wild Sourcery, Tark and Feanon are able to utilize their skills with little worry about negative magic surges.

With Cirrus not actually casting any magic and everyone else disarmed of magical weapons (save Gundren’s Saurian Firelance), there are no sourcery issues.

Though, the creatures were much more difficult to slay without metal weapons and armor.

Snorbul has a fantastic time though, loving his crystal Greataxe.

Feanon disintegrates one of the Bulettes and the last is slain quickly.

The group gathers teeth, bone, meat and carapace from the corpses and then look nearby for the creatures lair.

Gundren finds it and the group decides to camp there for the evening (having slain the previous owner).

The group settles down for their first night out in the wilderness on this strange new world. 

Tark spyies some Garnet encrusted dragon-kin skittering over the hills in the night and Cirrus looks up into an unfamiliar night sky, refusing to sleep…
