## The Western Wall

The group left the House Invincible and headed into the cold winter night. By quarter to eleven, the festival crowds had thinned to couples and young adults lingering in the streets. Cyrrus sent his owl overhead while Patches scaled a nearby rooftop to shadow the party from above.

On the way, several of them noticed a Spellguard officer walking briskly ahead. Patches spotted a cloaked figure shadowing the man from a rooftop and began tailing the tail. Below, Tark introduced himself to the officer — a reluctant man named Bendleberg, delivering orders to the western gate. Against his wishes, the group fell into step beside him.

At the construction site near midnight, Bendleberg veered off toward the Ironarm mercenaries. Patches moved in on the rooftop shadow, pressed a blade to his throat and discovered he was Bendleberg's hired bodyguard — and quickly scared the man into fleeing. The rest of the group blustered past the construction guards, invoking Thelm's authority. Tark followed Bendleberg to the top of the wall and watched him hand an envelope to the Ironarm captain before departing. Patches brushed past the Spellguard officer on the stairwell and picked his pocket, lifting several letters.

The Ironarms grew impatient and had Tark escorted off the premises. Patches trailed at a distance, reading the stolen correspondence. All orders were being distributed to Ironarm groups and originated from Von Issinger at the Silverymoon Palace. She also found references to College wardstones still being in place and being sought by agents named Elias and Octavio. On the way out, she and Tark disarmed Tark's escort and threw his sword nearby, which Patches then took.

Meanwhile, Cyrrus used thaumaturgy and prestidigitation to create confusion among the guards — until an attached mage dispelled the cantrips and called him out. Fëanon and Cyrrus tag-teamed the poor wizard, browbeating him and the guards into bewilderment long enough for Gundren to finish inspecting the wall and make a discovery.

Atop the wall, spaced every six metres, were iron octagonal rods covered in runes. The group determined them to be arcane bombs — kinetic batteries with an unknown activation method. They removed every one they could find and hurled them over the wall into the empty snowfield. The Ironarms were aghast. Knights in Silver stationed at the nearby city gate came to investigate.

Past midnight, with nothing else happening, the group started back toward the House Invincible. In the merchant quarter, they spied a cloaked figure rushing down an alley. Tark followed and shadowstepped to the rooftops — where he was promptly shot several times with arrows that puffed into smoke seconds after impact. He fell screaming. Buumi hauled himself up and healed the worst of the wounds, but the rooftops were empty. The group pressed on.

## The Master of Coin

Patches crossed the city to the Palace of Silverymoon — a marble edifice of grand columns and sweeping curves. The lowest windows were barred with ornate mithril. One had a light burning inside. She scaled the first floor, then the second — the window was sealed into its frame. She continued to the roof, pausing twenty feet from a guard, then slipped past and descended a spiral staircase, skipping trapped stones and tripwires to the ground floor.

A closed door stood between her and the interior. As she reached for her thieves' tools, footsteps approached. She climbed to the ceiling above the doorframe. A Knight in Silver walked through — and the tripwire became insubstantial as his boot passed through it. Patches slipped through the open door behind him.

In a dimly lit hallway, she found the room with light spilling under the door. She waited and watched as a grizzled Spellguard officer left the room, leaving the door ajar. Inside, a thin, hunched man scratched furiously at a letter with a quill — Von Issinger, the Master of Coin.

Patches tossed a flash bomb onto his desk. It detonated and the man flung himself backward. She was on him in an instant — bound, gagged and thrown into a corner. The man was terrified, spineless, and after a few minutes of interrogation she had everything she needed. Von Issinger had been accepting Amnian gifts and using the money to finance contracts for the Ironarm Mercenaries as a front. All orders being issued were for the Ironarms to take over general city patrol at dawn.

Dawn. Not midnight. They had the timing wrong.

Patches left via the front door — one more shady figure coming and going — and headed back to the House Invincible. She relayed her findings over the rockie talkies. Together with Tark, she forged counterfeit orders instructing the Ironarms to patrol outside the city wall. Tark spent the next hours shadowstepping across the city delivering the fakes, returning exhausted around three in the morning. The group told Thelm of the new intelligence. He adjusted his troops accordingly and confirmed that nothing unusual had been found in the sewers. They rested as best they could.

## Dawn

The group woke in the pre-dawn light, checked their gear, ate breakfast and headed into the cold winter morning. Thelm had already left for a council meeting with the Amnian leaders. They made for the western wall.

The gate was well guarded — Knights in Silver and Spellguard milling about — but standing wide open. Patches and Buumi lifted a manhole cover and the rogue dropped into the sewers. Meanwhile, Fëanon, Gundren and Cyrrus tried to convince the guards to close the gate. The guards seemed oddly unperturbed.

Tark shadowstepped to the top of the gate and looked out over the snowy plains. A column of soldiers and wagons approached — at least a thousand strong. At their head rode General Omar and a robed figure. The soldiers were fabulously equipped in ornate scale mail and furs, carrying shields, spears, swords and shortbows. For every ten soldiers, an eleventh wore the garb of a warrior-priest, holding a staff topped with an octagonal iron head. Mages marched among the ranks.

Tark leapt down on the outside of the wall. The nearby Ironarm mercenaries moved to reinforce the gate guard and ensure the gate stayed open. The bought guards did nothing as the army neared. Tark rushed to the approaching force and addressed Omar, who he knew to be a decent man. The General promised that no citizens would be harmed — they were there to secure Amnian holdings, not start a fight.

In the sewers, Patches found nothing save a few dead giant spiders. She set a satchel charge on a tripwire as insurance and returned to the surface just as the Amnians approached the main gate.

Cyrrus threw up a Wall of Force across the gate opening. The robed figure at the head of the column called a halt, pointed at the invisible barrier and hissed out a spell. A lance of ruby energy shattered the wall. Troops began entering the city. Patches pulled out her Deck of Illusions and spun a card into the oncoming soldiers. A hill giant appeared, roaring. The invading force broke into defensive formations, creating a ruckus that drew panicking civilians who spread the alarm through the city.

## The March

The Amnian mages destroyed the illusion and the army resumed its march toward the Merchant Quarter and the House Invincible. The group did not sit idle during the distraction.

Patches rode Kitty with Mr. Pickles toward the merchant quarter to find Tibbets and get the word out. Fëanon and Cyrrus summoned spectral steeds and raced to the Palace to inform the Senior Council. Buumi and Tark took Aurora to the Amnian Embassy to find Cyrrus's brother S'Olaa. Gundren and Gwen tailed the Amnian column through the Elven Quarter.

Growing tired of tiptoeing, Gundren gave instructions to Gwen and ducked into an alley. The mechanical lion charged past the Amnian rear and aimed her lightning blast down the length of a column — only for a counterspell to snuff the bolt. Gwen leapt to a rooftop under a hail of arrows, taking several hits but escaping to rejoin Gundren. They both headed for the Plaza of the Watchers.

At the embassy, Tark shadowstepped into the building using the last shadows of dawn. He found nothing in the office, punched through a wall and startled a maid, who told him S'Olaa had left for the Palace with his master. He escaped through a window and rejoined Buumi.

At the Palace, Fëanon and Cyrrus were stopped at the council chamber doors — a closed session was in progress and the doors required a 'Mythal Key' to open. The ground shook with muffled explosions from within. The guards could not open the doors. A thought from Theodemir's spirit reminded Fëanon of the Archmage brooch Patches had recovered from the bone pile beneath the Illithid hive. He held the silvery emblem up and unlocked the wards — but a Wall of Force still blocked the doors from the other side. The nearest alternative access to the city defences was the Plaza of the Watchers. They rushed there with half the guard.

As he left, Fëanon received a message from Megno: the Dwarven delegation had arrived early — forty dwarves, half in session with the Council and Amnians, the rest already at the Plaza. He warned Megno of the impending attack, but the enchanter and his people were already caught in the crowd.

## The Plaza of the Watchers

The group reconvened at the south entrance to the Merchant Quarter. Gundren laid out what they were seeing: a planned riot. The Amnians were using plain-clothes mercenaries to push the population into attacking them — providing justification to garrison the city — while traitors and Amnian heavy-hitters killed the Council and framed the dwarves.

They pushed through the crowd to the plaza and the large marble statue at its centre — the Golem of the Mythal. Patches noticed the mercenaries handing out stones and bricks, shoving the crowd toward violence. She donned her gloves, dipped the fingertips in Carrion Crawler Mucus and worked through the crowd, brushing as many mercenaries as she could with the contact poison to paralyse them.

On her way, she spotted four Spellguard hauling a hooded, bound prisoner in uniform down an alley. She hurled a smoke bomb and cut the rope, dragging the prisoner free. It was Officer Li — beaten and used as a scapegoat to link the party to the Illithid, giving the Amnians cause to intervene. Li donned Patches' Baldur's Gate uniform and stayed at the back of the crowd.

The Amnians took up defensive positions across from the gathered civilians. Paladins from the House Invincible massed on the steps. Knights in Silver and Spellguard arrived in disorganised clusters, many misdirected by the Ironarms. The Dwarven delegation stood at the front lines, exchanging harsh words with a mounted Abdul, whose magically amplified voice accused the dwarves of underhanded tactics and Illithid collaboration. He announced warrants for Megno Slatesunder and Forgemaster Halfhand. The crowd roared in support of their Dwarven neighbours. The first stones flew.

## The Battle for Silverymoon

Fëanon rushed forward, conjuring a heavy fog around the Golem to give the group cover. An Amnian strike team charged to secure it — four plate-clad veterans led by a huge warrior with a lightning-crackling halberd and a gap-toothed grin, backed by a scowling Half-Orc war-priest, a navy-robed mage with a flesh golem, and an unarmoured blonde monk who sprinted ahead of them all.

Cyrrus and Gundren opened fire from the steps of the House Invincible, forcing the mage onto the defensive. Buumi, Patches, Mr. Pickles and Gwen intercepted the monk, the golem and two veterans. Fëanon activated the Mythal using the Archmage brooch and began retreating toward the steps, launching a fireball into the Amnian champions. An assassin slipped from the crowd and struck him — then vanished. Fëanon staggered but held, and when the assassin emerged again he was ready with a shield spell that sent sparks flying.

Gundren downed one veteran with his thundercannon, then crushed a ruby from his helmet and summoned a wall of fire to split the Amnian champions from their army. The wall cut the monk and flesh golem off from the mage and war-priest. His triumph was brief — two halfling archers on a wagon peppered him with arrows that dissolved into smoke.

The flesh golem's flaming maul put Mr. Pickles down and turned on Buumi. Patches flanked the construct and together they tore it apart while Buumi's healing aura kept the goblin alive. They surrounded the monk, who landed several stunning pressure-point blows on Patches before a leg sweep put her on the floor. Gwen charged but took arrows and more blows, shutting her down. Mr. Pickles was ordered to flee to safety. Cornered against the wall of fire, the monk steeled herself and dove through the flames to rejoin her allies.

In the fog, Tark faced the huge halberdier alone. The man stomped and sent a wave of earth to trip the halfling, who leapt over it and engaged. Blow for blow they went at it, the big man laughing — "Nothing personal. I enjoy a worthy opponent!" — until the fog dispersed and the brighter midday light robbed Tark of his shadows. The halberdier landed several devastating swings and Tark found himself in dire straits.

Across the battlefield, the Amnians had begun using deadly force simply to survive. The streets ran red. A lance of ruby energy crackled from the Palace into the sky. A section of the building collapsed. Knights in Silver and Spellguard finally organised and flanked the Amnian force. Abdul screamed orders from horseback. General Omar was nowhere to be seen. The Dwarves fought viciously, Silverymoon citizens shoulder to shoulder with their bearded allies, Megno at their head blasting sheets of flame and casting defensive magic.

A second explosion ripped through the Palace and a dozen figures flew east, fleeing the city. The Amnian mage saw them go and shouted a command. Each of the Amnian champions downed a potion of flight and abandoned the battle.

Then, from the pedestal at the centre of the plaza, the Mythal Golem stepped down. Massive and flowing marble, it strode through the crowd toward the Amnian line. Shuddering footsteps echoed from the surrounding streets as the other Golems converged to defend their city. The fighting died down.

Ten figures flew swiftly into the square — nine in dark blue robes with silver embroidery, gold masks and varied staves: the Senior Council. At their head flew a different figure entirely. Seamless silver plate armour with bands of mithril and adamantite, no visible eye-slits or seams in the helm — barely recognisable as female. High Marshal Arasume landed with tremendous force before the cowering Amnians. Eight great silver swords floated in an arc above and behind her like wings, each tip pointed forward with lethal intent.

Tark turned to the magnificent figure and offered a call of greeting. The metal helm turned slightly, acknowledging the halfling. The Amnian force shuffled uneasily. Abdul could be seen in near-panic atop his steed. The coup had failed.
