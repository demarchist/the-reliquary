**The House Invincible**

Vigilant Master Thelm excuses himself from the group and goes to his door, calling over an attendant to fetch his lieutenants and begin calling in the troops.

The group is clustered around the fireplace and quickly decide that they need to head to the Western City gate, the one the Ironarm mercenaries had been patrolling whilst it's under construction.

The group leaves, informing Thelm of their plan and heading out into the cold winter night.

It's 10:40 and the crowds of people have subsided significantly.  Couples and young adults still wander the roads, enjoying what little remains of the holiday.

Cirrus sends his owl overhead to scout and Patches climbs swiftly up a nearby rooftop to shadow the group while they make their way to the Western gate.

On the way, several of the group notice a Spellguard officer up ahead, walking briskly through the snowy streets.

Patches notes that the Spellguard officer is being shadowed up on a rooftop by a cloaked figure and she begins tailing the tail.

Down below, the group hurries ahead and catch up to the Spellguard officer, Tark introducing himself and asking if the man new officer Li and where he was going this evening.

The Spellguard officer dismisses Tark with little thought, unwilling to engage and briskly continues on.  The halfling is determined however, and follows, re-introducing himself.

The Spellguard relents and introduces himself as Bendleberg and mentions that he is delivering orders to the Western Gate.  Against his wishes, the group tags along with him.

**The West Gate**

Arriving at the western city gate near midnight, Bendleberg veers off to the wall section under construction, evidently delivering orders to the Ironarm mercenaries stationed there.

The cloaked figure tailing Bendleberg comes to a halt, watching from a rooftop.  Patches moves in and quietly comes up behind the figure, weapon in hand and presses it to the persons throat.

After a quick interrogation, Patches discovers that the tail is a hired guard for Bendleberg.  Paid to follow and provide support if needed.  Patches actions however, scare the man off and he flees once Patches relents.

The rest of the group sees Bendleberg head into the construction area of the wall and they follow close behind.  Patches drops to the street below and rejoins the group.

The group blusters their way into the construction site, persuading the guards of their instructions from Master Thelm to be allowed access. 

The guards are all pretty adamant the group can't be there and attempt to begin corralling the group out of the area.

Tark follows Bendleberg to the top of the wall and watches him hand the Ironarm captain an envelope and then leave. Bendleberg leaves past Patches on the stairwell, veritably running into one another and the Rogue picks his pocket, grabbing a couple of letters.

As Tark begins questioning the Guard Captain, the Ironarms have had enough and call for a guard to escort Tark from the premises and he's walked away from the wall.

Patches follows the guard and Tark at a stealthy distance, reading the notes she lifted from Bendleberg and realizes that all the orders being distributed are to Ironarm groups and originate from Von Issinger, in the Silverymoon Palace.  She also finds references to the College Wardstones still being in place and being looked for by Elias and Octavio.

Patches Rockie Talkies the group, telling them she's heading off to do "paper work" and leaves the area to head to the Palace.

On her way, her and Tark disarm the guard escorting the halfling and throw his sword nearby, which Patches then takes to further confuse the poor man.

Meanwhile, the guards are getting frustrated in trying to get the group to leave the area.  Cirrus uses thaumaturgy and prestidigitation to create some confusion, until a mage assigned to this guard dispels the cantrips and calls Cirrus out.

Seeing an opportunity, Fey and Cirrus then gang up on the poor mage and brow beat him, and the local guard into a state of confusion, just long enough for Gundren to finish inspecting the wall...and discover something out of sorts.

Atop the wall, spaced evenly every 6m, the group discovers Iron octagonal rods covered in runes. Investigating the magic around the rods, they determine them to be arcane bombs of a sort.  Kinetic batteries with an unknown activation method.

The group removes all that they can find and launches them over the wall into the empty snow-field or in Tark's case, Shadowstepping over the wall and into the field to then toss them into the snow.

The Ironarms are aghast at the discovery of the bombs and the Knights in Silver stationed at the nearby city gate come over to investigate the disturbance.

It's past midnight at this point and the group relaxes a little when absolutely nothing happens.  They decide that something is going to happen soon and that they should be well rested for when it happens.

The group begins making their way back to The House Invincible, hoping Thelm and his Paladins have found something more.

On the way, nearing the Merchant quarter, the group spies a cloaked figure rushing down a nearby alleyway.  Suspicious, Tark follows, the rest of the group in close pursuit.

They enter the alley and note that the tracks in the snow stop quickly.  Gundren suspects the rooftops and Tark shadowsteps up to continue the chase. He is promptly shot several times with arrows.

The arrows all puff away into smoke a few seconds after he is hit and he falls down screaming in pain, bleeding into the snow.

Buumi uses his prosthetic to grab the roof top and pull himself up to assist Tark and he quickly heals the worst of the wounds.  Looking around, the rooftops are empty.

The group decides to move on and continue back to The House Invincible.

**The Master of Coin**

Meanwhile, across the city, Patches has made it to the Palace of Silverymoon. A Beautiful Marble edifice of grand columns and sweeping curves, reminiscent of the natural beauty found throughout the city.

Inspecting the exterior, Patches notes many small windows, the lowest level of which have ornate Mithril bars in flowing designs protecting them.  One of the windows has a light on inside. Someone is working late.

Approaching the window with stealth, Patches peers through the bars and is met with a window of frosted glass, the details of the interior obscured entirely.

Patches scales the first floor, finding small handholds in the seams of the marble blocks and scales to the second floor, twenty feet up.  The window up here has no bars, but seems to be entirely sealed into the frame.  There is no way to unlock the window.

Deciding to find another way in, Patches finishes scaling the last few dozen feet to the rooftop and pauses, noting a guard twenty feet away.  Once satisfied the guard would not notice her, she vaults over the crenelations and onto the patrol path, just at the bottom of the slanted copper rooftop.

Patches spots a spiral staircase near the guard and slinks over, easily making her way down.

Descending all three floors and skipping over several trapped stones and tripwires, Patches makes it to the ground floor and sees a closed wooden door leading further inside.

Investigating the door, she finds it trapped and just as she begins taking her thieves tools out, hears approaching footsteps.

Patches quickly climbs up to the ceiling, above the door and waits for whomever is approaching.

Moments later, the door swings open and a Knight in Silver walks through.  Patches clearly notes that the guard walks *through* the tripwire, the cord becoming insubstantial as the guard's boot passes through it.

Marveling at the magical security doesn't stop the Rogue from slipping through the open door and gaining access to the Palace proper.

Now in a large dimly lit hallway, Patches slinks from shadow to shadow, heading back to where the lit room should be.  The lack of light in the Palace at this time of night makes the infiltration simple and Patches easily finds the room, light spilling from under the door.

She waits for a few moments scaling a nearby wall and studies the situation. During that time, sees a Spellguard Officer, and older grizzled human man with a bushy salt and pepper beard, leave the room and stride away.

The Spellguard leaves the door ajar and Patches can easily see inside.  She sees an sagely man in his middle years, thin and hunched over his desk, quill scratching away at a letter.  In moments he finishes, seals the letter and moves on to the next, writing furiously and with great concentration.

Patches tosses a flash bomb onto his desk, through the open door. It lands with a thud in front of him and the man stares at it in stunned confusion for a split second.

The bomb goes off and the man flings himself backward out of his chair to get away from the stinging light, crying in surprise and pain.

Patches is in the room in an instant, and rushes to the man, binding and gagging him with efficient ease and throws the light human into the corner of the office.

Patches waits, breathing quietly, waiting to see if anyone was alerted to the brief scuffle.  Secure and confident that no one did, she closes the office door and locks it, turning to her prisoner to begin the interrogation.

The man is terrified and wets himself and Patches quickly realizes the man has no spine.

After a few minutes of questions and rooting around the office, Patches confirms that the man is Von Issinger, the Silverymoon master of coin and has been paying and supplying contracts to the Ironarm Mercenaries as a front for the Amnians.  The Amnians pay Issinger "gifts" which he then uses to finance the mercenaries.

Additionally, all the orders and contracts being issued are for the Ironarms to take over general city patrol at dawn.

Realising that they had their timing wrong, that whatever was going to happen was happening at Dawn, Patches hurries from the Palace, via the front door (what's one more shady individual coming and going).  Though not before giving the Master of Coin some simple instructions and loosening his bindings.

Patches heads back to the House Invincible for some much needed rest, and informs the rest of the group about her findings.

Worried about the impending event at Dawn, Patches and Tark take some time to forge counterfeit orders to replace those that Patches took from Von Issinger's desk.

The counterfeit orders instruct the Ironarms to patrol outside the city wall.  

While the counterfeiting is happening, the others check in with Thelm, they tell him of the new information about dawn, the Ironarms and the bombs found in the wall.

Thelm accepts the new information and has his troops rest and ready themselves for action at Dawn.  He also lets the group know that nothing out of the ordinary was found in the sewers.

Tark then hurries around the city, shadowstepping from shadow to shadow to deliver the orders and returns to the House Invincible, exhausted, around 3 a.m.

The group then does their best to rest and prepare themselves for a showdown with the Amnians at dawn.

**Dawn**

The group wakes in the pre-dawn light and check over their gear, eat breakfast and head out into the cold winter morning, snow lazily drifting down from above.

Before leaving, they inquire as to the location of Thelm and discover that he has left for a council meeting with the Amnian leaders.

The group then makes haste to the western wall, where they fully expect an Amnian attack.

Approaching the Western Gate, the group finds it well guarded, Knights in Silver and Spellguard milling around...but the gate is wide open.

Patches and Buumi head to a nearby manhole cover and Buumi lifts it for the Rogue to drop below the streets.

Meanwhile, Fey, Gundren and Cirrus begin trying to impress upon the guards that they need to close the gate due to an impending invasion.  The guards seem oddly unperturbed.

Tark Shadowsteps to the top of the gate to look out over the snowy plains and sees a column of soldiers and wagons approaching, at least a thousand strong.  At their head is General Omar and a robed figure, both on horseback.

The army is over a thousand strong, with a full wagon train.  The soldiers are all fabulously equipped in ornate scale mail, furs and other winter gear, each carrying a shield, spear, sword and shortbow.

For every ten man, an eleventh wears the garb of a warrior-priest, each holding a strange staff with an octagonal Iron head.  Several other robed figures can also be seen marching amongst the troops; mages.

Tark leaps down to the ground on the outside of the wall, while the group points out the invading force to the Gate-guards.  As they do this, the nearby Ironarm mercenaries from the wall the night before all move over to reinforce the gate guard, and ensure the gate stays open...

The guards at the gate, apparently all bought or working for the traitors, do nothing as the army nears the gate.  There are enough of them to give the group pause in using force.

Tark rushes up to the approaching force and addresses Omar, who he knows to be a decent person.  They exchange words and Tark gets the sense that the man is following orders albeit somewhat reluctantly.  General Omar does promise Tark that no citizens will be harmed at the gate and their intent is not to get into a fight.  They are here to secure the Amnian holdings within the city.

Underneath the city streets, Patches scouts the sewers and finds nothing out of sorts save for a few dead giant spiders.  Just in case though, the sets a satchel charge on a tripwire to go off in case any Amnians attempt to infiltrate through the sewers and then returns to the surface, just in time to see the Amnians approach the main gate.

Thinking quickly, Cirrus enacts a wall of force to cover the city gate.

The robed figure at the head of the column calls for a halt, points at the invisible wall and hisses out a spell.  A flash of red light and a disintegrating beam of energy lances out and shatters the wall.  The troops begin entering the city.

Trying to buy more time and cause a ruckus to get peoples attention, Patches pulls out her Deck of Illusions and spins a card into the oncoming soldiers.  Moments later, a Hill Giant appears, roaring and the invading force is thrown into momentary chaos.

The troops fall back, ringing the Hill giant and going into defensive formations, creating a hell of a ruckus.  Civilians begin showing up on the edge of the Gate Square, see the giant and the Amnians and quickly flee in a panic.  Word begins spreading through the city.

**The March**

As quickly as the Amnians reacted to the illusionary giant, the armies' mages deal with the illusion, destroying it.  The army quickly returns to ranks and resumes entering the city, marching toward The Merchant Quarter and The House Invincible.

The group however did not remain stationary during the distraction.  

Patches rushes off with Kitty and Mr. Pickles to get ahead of the force and find Tibbets in The Merchant Quarter and try to get the word out.

Fey and Cirrus summon their spectral steeds and hurry to the Palace to inform the Senior Council.

Buumi and Tark take Aurora to the Amnian Embassy to try and find Cirrus' brother S'Olaa.

Meanwhile, Gundren and Gwen tail the Amnian force as it heads through the main thoroughfare of the Elven Quarter, making quick progress through the snowy, tree-lined streets.

Getting tired of all the tiptoeing, Gundren gives instructions to Gwen and then ducks away into an alleyway.  Gwen rushes past the back lines of the Amnians and the wagons, approaching a column of soldiers and charges up her lightning blast, intending to shoot it down the length of the column.

Just as the building electrical energy is released, a Counterspell from one of the Amnian mages blocks the incoming bolt of electricity and the Amnian soldiers scramble into a defense, pulling out bows and crossbows.  Gwen had specific instructions and didn't wait to see the result of the lightning, leaping to a nearby rooftop and pulling herself over the top just as arrows and bolts slam into the building around her.  She takes several hits but manages to get away and meet up with Gundren.

The two of them then rush off to The Merchant Quarter and the Plaza of The Watchers in front of The House Invincible.

As Patches rushes through the city, she takes note of many groups of civilians gathering.  Many of them have plains-clothed Ironarm mercenaries talking to them and Patches notes that many of the groups end up walking in the direction of The House Invincible, clearly agitated.

As she nears the edge of the Merchant Quarter, Patches notes a large crowd gathering out front of The House Invincible, in the Plaza of the Watchers.  Patches notices some movement in a nearby alleyway. She dismounts and has Mr. Pickles continue on.

Sneaking closer to the alley, Patches sees four Spellguard waiting, "hidden".  A fifth person with a bag over their head and with hands roped together, wearing a Spellguard uniform is being pulled along.

Thinking quickly, Patches hurls a smoke bomb into the alley and rushes forward, cutting the rope and then dragging the captive out of the alley and rushing on.

Clearing the alley and exiting the area before the traitor spellguard could react, Patches and the prisoner take cover and remove the hood and rope bonds.

The prisoner is Officer Li.

Patches discovers that Li was taken by Captain Mikael of the Spellguard and was to be used as a scapegoat to link the party to the Illithid, Dwarves and other illegal/disreputable actions, giving the Amnians due cause to bring in troops to secure their holdings in the city.  They beat Li to get the information and used her Grell to extract what she wouldn't say.

Patches pulls out her Baldur's Gate uniform and has Li wear it and the two of them head to the gathering crowd, Li staying at the back to avoid the coming conflict (as she's injured).

Patches Rockietalkies to Gundren, telling the group of Officer Li, the gathering crowd of civilians and that the Amnians are nearing the Merchant Quarter.

**The Embassy**

Buumi and Tark make it to the Embassy very quickly atop Aurora. When they get there, they see a bustle of activity as many of the local guards rush from the building to support their newly arrived troops.

Buumi approaches the front gate to inquire and distract while Tark makes his way up a nearby tree.  The shadows almost gone from the city, Tark uses what little darkness remains to shadowstep into Rama Al Kayan's office.

He finds the office exactly as it was left when he was last in there, but pushes a bookcase over to barricade the door just in case of an unwanted visitor.

Tark searches the office but finds nothing.  He knocks on the wall that was behind the bookcase he moved and thinks he hears the hollow sound of a room on the other side.  Tark punches the wall in a flurry, smashing a hole big enough to look through and startles a horrified maid.

He asks the woman where S'Olaa is and she responds that he went with his master to a meeting at the Palace.  Bordering on hysteria, the woman swears that's all she knows.

Tark thanks the confused woman and then leaps from the window to the grounds below, making a fast and stealthy escape from the Embassy grounds and meets up with Buumi back by Aurora.

Buumi got no information from the guards and he and Tark decide to head to meet up in The Plaza of the Watchers, where the Amnian force is heading.

**The Palace**

Cirrus and Fey rush to the Palace and approach the front gate, dismissing their mounts.  The Palace guards look on, undisturbed until Fey enters the foyer and approaches the doors to the main audience chamber.

The guards stop the Warlock and Wizard, telling them a closed session of the Council is occurring and that if they have business with the Council they must return at a later time.

Fey and Cirrus quickly impart the urgency of the situation, just as confirmation of the Amnian force reaches the palace.  

The ground suddenly shakes and muffled explosions can be heard within the chamber and the guards rush forwards.

The guards rush forwards to open the doors to the council chambers, but they won't budge, requiring the Mythal key to unlock and open.

A thought enters Fey's mind from his ring and he remembers the Archmage brooch Patches idly recovered from the pile of dead underneath Nostalgia.  Pulling the silvery emblem from a pouch, he focuses on it and with help from the spirit of Theodemir, realises that it's a Mythal Key.

Holding the emblem up, Fey unlocks the doors to the Council Chambers, but the doors still won't budge. With the ward down though, he now senses a Wall of Force on the other side, knowing there's no way through, he turns and asks the guards if there's another entrance.

The guards remark that there is, but they are sealed just like this one was.

Fey swears at them and asks if there's a nearby place to activate the city defenses.

He finds out that other than The Council Chamber, the closest is The Plaza of the Watchers in front of the House Invincible.

Half the Guard rushes out with Fey and Cirrus to head to the Plaza while the other half remain and attempt to gain access to the Council.

Just as Fey is leaving, he gets a short message from Megno - that the Dwarven delegation has arrived early, forty Dwarves and that half are in session with the Council and Amnians and the rest have headed to The Plaza of the Watchers after prodding and convincing from the "locals".

Fey warns Megno of the impending attack and to get out of the Plaza but Megno and his folks are already there and are having a hard time moving through the crowd.

**The Plaza of the Watchers**

The group reconvenes at the south entrance to The Merchant Quarter and share information. Gundren points out that this is looking like a planned "riot"; that the Amnians are using the plains-clothed mercenaries to push the local population into attacking them, to provide a reason to garrison the city, while the traitors and Amnian heavy hitters kill the Council and frame the Dwarves.

The group begins pushing through the crowd, getting to the Plaza and the large marble statue in the center - a Golem of the Mythal.

As they push through, Patches once again notices the plains clothed mercenaries riling up the crowd, handing out stones and bricks and pushing the crowd closer to riot.

Patches puts on her gloves and dips the fingers into a vial of Carrion Crawler Mucus and then intentionally passes as many of the mercenaries as she can, brushing them with the contact poison to paralyze them and distract the crowd.

 The Amnian force enters the plaza and takes up defensive positions across from the gathered crowd of civilians, creating a no-mans land with the Golem statue near the middle.

The group makes it to the front of the crowd.

The Amnians have a shield wall facing the civilians.  The Paladins of the House Invincible are mostly situated on the steps, ready to intervene, though many are out among the crowd.

 Scattered throughout are many spellguard and Knights in Silver, but all are disorganized (more rushing to the plaza, but being caught in the throng or misdirected by the Ironarm mercenaries).

Fey, Tark, Buumi and Patches begin to make their way to the Golem to activate it.  Gundren and Cirrus head to the steps of the House Invincible to take up firing positions among the gathered and ready paladins.  As they go, they note the contingent of Dwarves on the front lines, exchanging harsh words with a mounted Abdul, behind several ranks of Amnian soldiers and near Omar and the hooded mage.

They overhear Abdul shouting (his voice magically amplified) about the Dwarves using illegal an underhanded tactics to undermine the Amnians.  The Illithids making deals and inroads into the city supported by corrupt officials and that the Amnians are here to restore order and ensure ongoing prosperity.  Abdul swears that the soldiers are here to secure the city from outside threats.

The crowd is not buying it (being stoked on by the mercenaries) and the Dwarves hurl back insults.

Abdul calls out that he has a warrant out for the arrest of Megno Slatesunder and Forgemaster Halfhand of Sundabar.  This infuriates the Dwarves and many in the crowd shout out their support for their Dwarven neighbors from Sundabar.

Just then, the first improvised missiles fly out from the crowd and smash into Amnian shields and the soldiers lower their spears in warning, preparing for violence.

**The Battle for Silverymoon**

Fey rushes forward, calling up a heavy fog to obscure the Golem and giving the group cover to approach it.  Seeing this, a comparable Amnian force rushes forward to secure the Golem.

This seems to be all the impetus the crowd needs and the Silverymoon citizens rush forwards, the Amnians surge to meet them and the Paladins descend the steps to do what they can.

Though the crowd has turned violent, the Amnians are not fighting back with deadly force, hitting with blunt edges or shields.

The squad that has rushed forward to secure the Golem however, is not holding back.

Four plate clad veterans in formation with a huge warrior sprint ahead.

The huge, ornate-plate clad warrior, wielding a halberd crackling with lightning energy leads the group. Wearing an open faced helm revealing a wide and friendly gap-toothed smile, with a dark complexion and striking green eyes.

Behind them comes a scowling and chanting Half-Orc woman, also in Plate armor, holding a glittering mace and shining holy symbol.

A cloaked and robed figure in navy blue, his face shrouded by his hood but wielding a wand and spellbook and accompanied by a hulking flesh golem, plate covered and wielding a massive maul takes up the rear.

Lastly, an unarmored feminine figure sprints off to one side, a monk with tightly braided blonde hair and caramel skin that rushes past her comrades to get to the Golem.

The Amnian champions engage the group to stop them from activating The Mythal.

Immediately, Cirrus and Gundren open fire from the steps of the House Invincible, forcing the Mage to go on the defensive and begin dispelling magic.

The monk, armored flesh golem and two of the veterans all move in but are cut off by Buumi, Patches, Mr. Pickles and Gwen.

Fey activates the Mythal using the archmage brooch and begins to retreat to the steps of the House Invincible. He casts a powerful fireball into the assaulting Amnian champions.  As he does so, he is attacked by an assassin slipping out of the crowd.  As quick as he strikes, the assassin slips back into the throng of people, disappearing.

Fey staggers, hurt but manages to hold steady and continue toward safety. The assassin however, slips out of the crowd again, but this time Fey is ready and enacts a shield, blocking the blows in a shower of sparks.

The assassin turns to retreat and stumbles, knocked down in the crowd of people as the civilians around Fey catch on that the assassin is an enemy, forcing the Assassin to relent on the attack.

Gundren fires shot after shot into the Amnians with his Thundercannon, downing one Veteran and badly wounding another.

thinking quickly, he pulls one of the rubies from his magnificent helmet and crushes it, calling forth a wall of fire to cut off the Amnian champions from their supporting army.

The searing wall of flame pushes the Amnians back and splits the Monk and Flesh Golem from the mage and war-priest, allowing the group to focus their fire.

Gundren's cocky attitude is short lived though as he then takes a hail of arrows to the chest, shot from two halflings that hopped up on a wagon some 150ft away.

No sooner had Gundren been peppered with arrows, than the missiles puff away into smoke and the Halflings drop back down off the wagon, hiding from view.

The War-Priest rushes forward to revive her fallen comrade, sending out healing waves of magic as she does so, bolstering her allies.  The fury of the group is too much though, and her revived comrade is quickly re-killed and the wall of fire forces her back.

The monk and Flesh golem engage Buumi, Gwen and Mr. Pickles and deal massive damage to the trio.  Mr. Pickles goes down under the flaming maul of the Golem, which then turns its attention to Buumi and begins smashing away at the Paladin.  Things are looking rough until Patches sprints out of the crowd, flanking the Flesh Golem.

With Gwen holding his flank against the monk, Buumi and Patches make quick work of the Flesh Golem, tearing it apart while the healing Aura emanating from Buumi keeps Mr. Pickles from death.

Turning their attention to the Monk, Gwen, Patches and Buumi quickly surround the woman. 

Despite this, the monk manages to land several stinging blows on Patches, hitting pressure points and stunning the Drow.  Growling through the pain, Patches finds a surge of adrenaline and counters, tripping the monk to the floor with a sweep. 

Gwen goes in to attack the downed monk but is stopped as she is damaged in a flurry of blows from the monk and arrows from the halflings, putting her out of the fight.

Mr. Pickles gets back up and is commanded to flee back to Kitty by Patches.  The seriously wounded goblin does not offer resistance.

The monk backs up as best she can but is pinned against the wall of fire.  She steels herself and dives through it, reuniting with the Amnian Mage and war-priest.

In the fog cloud Tark makes quick work of the Veteran Amnians, turning his attention to the huge halberd-wielding man.  The man stomps, sending a wave of earth out from the impact to trip the halfling, but he leaps over it, coming back in to duel the man.

The monk and huge man go back and forth, hitting one another with wicked blows.  The huge man laughs and seems to be enjoying himself, remarking that "it's nothing personal.  I enjoy a worthy opponent!".

The fog disperses and in the brighter light of near-midday, Tark finds that his ability to shadowstep is severely limited.

The big man hits Tark with several devastating swings of his halberd and the small monk appears to be in dire straights.

Across the battlefield, Amnians have begun resorting to deadly force simply to stay alive and the streets are slick with blood and the snow has turned into a red slush.

From the Palace of Silverymoon, a lance of ruby energy crackles into the sky and the ground shudders.  A section of the palace collapses as it's destroyed by powerful magic.

Knights in Silver and Spellguard have managed to organize and flank the Amnian force.  Now in dire straights, the Amnian resolve seems to be wavering and Abdul can be seen shouting orders from horseback near the mage.  General Omar is nowhere to be seen.

The Dwarves are being viciously attacked, but the citizens of silverymoon fight shoulder to shoulder with their Dwarven comrades, keeping the bearded folk from being overwhelmed.

At their head is Megno, casting defensive magics and blasting back with sheets of flame and the Dwarves rally around their powerful Enchanter.

Another blast is heard from the direction of the Palace and moments later, a dozen figures can be seen flying from the area, heading east and out of the city.

The Amnian champions see this and the mage shouts a command.  Each of the Amnian champions down a potion of flight and flee the battle, flying over their own soldiers and quickly vacating the area.

The Amnian resolve all but crumbles, but the fighting continues in pockets.

Then, from the pedestal in the center of the Plaza steps the Mythal Golem.  Massive and made of flowing marble, the statue takes several steps through the crowd and toward the Amnians, whose line backs up as best they can.

On the periphery of the square, shuddering footsteps can be heard as the other Mythal Golems congregate to defend their city.  The fighting dies down and the Civilians back away from the combat, priests and paladins rushing around, tending to the wounded.

Seemingly from nowhere, ten figures swiftly fly into the square above the heads of the crowd.  Nine in dark blue robes with silver embroidery, Gold masks and staffs of varying makes and designs: The Senior Council.  

At their head flies a different figure.  

Clad in seamless Silver plate armor, with no under-suit or chainmail showing and covered in bands of Mithril and Adamantite reminiscent of musculature.  

The figure's helm is similar to that of a Knights, but with no visible eye-slits or seams. 

The form of the warrior is only barely noticeable as female; it is High-Marshal Arasume and she lands with tremendous force before the cowering Amnians. 

The Senior Council takes up positions, floating above and circling the surrounded Amnians.

Eight great silver swords float in an arc above and behind the High-Marshal, reminiscent of wings and as she turns to the invading force, each sword's tip points forward with deadly intent.

Nearby Tark turns to the magnificent figure and offers a call of greeting and the metal figure turns her helmeted head slightly toward the halfling, acknowledging his presence. 

The Amnian force shuffles uneasily and Abdul can be seen in a near panic atop his steed.  The Amnian Coup has failed...
