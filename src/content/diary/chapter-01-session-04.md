Gundren Rockseeker wakes in ToD surrounded by pillows and next to an unconscious and scarred halfling.

Looking around he sees a meditating high elf, drow, wood elf, half elf, cat-thing and the halfling.

Gundren shakes awake the Halfling, who bolts upright and beings to yell, only to have his mouth quickly covered.

The rest of the group however is awoken by this exchange, a drunken Buumi poking his head over a couch and observing.

Tark realizes he is Blind in his left eye.

At this moment, the Goblin Mr.Pickles walks in carrying drinks, surprising Tark, he kills the goblin with a flurry of blows and a snapped neck.  Buumi, fealing bad, Lays on Hands the Goblin, healing it and it gets right back to work.

The Goblins that have been living in the ToD for about a week now have blue skin and solid black eyes. Astral Goblins.

Gundren realizes this is the group he hired in Neverwinter to help him with Wave Echo

Strangely, Dr.B, JmJm and Lolthli don’t wake up. Investigating, Fey discovers that their minds are trapped in sleep in the Shadowfell. There's not much they can do so they keep them comfortable.

Gundren then convinces the group to head back to cragmaw to retrieve his gear, as the only way into Wave Echo Cave requires a wardstone, which he got made in the Wizard town of Longsaddle. Gundren was originally captured for the wardstone.  In nothing but his long jons, Gundren requests a weapon and is given Chopsticks (axe +1)

A distraught Tark (distraught over his injuries) leaves ToD to mull over the situation. Leaving ToD they notice a disturbing fog dissipating in the morning sun.

Heading back into Cragmaw then way they got out, they sneak back to the throne room, looking through the keyhole, they see the Bugbear chief sleeping.

Patches sneaks through the door, a Hobgoblin on either side.  No one notices due to the use of the Piwafwi she took from Tarla.

Patches sneaks up to the Bugbear, chief and attempts to assassinate him several times, each time the chieften moving just enough to miss dying, before finally slitting his throat.

The Hobgoblins finally notice and draw their swords, the rest of the group kicks open the door and charges through

Gundren immediately embeds his axe in the stomach of the one on the left, with Fey - magic missiling it to death and hitting the other, which then takes a crossbow bolt from Patches.  Buumi is still in the door frame, with his sword out, not having gotten a chance to use it.

Looting the room of the 200g the Doppleganger paid for Gundren, the dwarf retrieves his artificing gear; his schematic book, pack, splint mail, ammo magazine and his thundercannon.

The group then leaves the way it came in.

Heading back to the wagon, the group decides to travel through the rest of Neverwinter wood and to the road to get to Longsaddle which is three days away.  The others still have not woken up and look increasingly distressed.

Day 1, through the woods and on the main road, the group makes it's way to the ruins of Coneyberry on the way to longsaddle, they go along a path to the Banshee Agatha's lair.  They talk with Agatha, flattering her and get the information that the spellbook Sister Gisele wants is no longer in the area.  On the way out, the group pays Agatha for the contents of her chest, a pair of spiderkin bracers. (tark has one, Gundren the other)

Day 2 uneventful until the group stumble across two arguing Ettins, they seem to have concern over the mists and want to head East, Patches distracts (nat 20) them and the group continues onwards to Longsaddle.

Day 3, approaching their goal, they see a figure in the distance coming towards them.  They meet Moot, an elderly Monk with a flock of golden canaries (7).  He serves the group tea, chats with them and asks Tark to spar.  He fights Tark, and they end up having a good time, Ysera, one of the canaries takes a liking to Tark and decides to follow him.  Moot mentions the Neverwinter festival of re-founding and tells the group he would like to see them at it after they finish their quest.  The group detects magic on his staff and see that it is tremendously enchanted.  Moot ends the fight with a Ki Blast and remarks to Tark that study and perseverance will reveal all secrets.

Tark is now feeling less despondent and the group arrives to longsaddle, the town off in front of them, but the Ivy Manor up on a hill to the left, with a small bridge crossing a river.

Tark strips naked and jumps in the river, no longer seeming to care about his blindness. he is very well endowed…

The group passes over the bridge, the moment they step foot on it however, their perception of the world flips, they see themselves hanging on the underside of the bridge moving forwards.  Tark however sees them traveling over it normally, but with the group freaking out.  It's hilarious.

Group approaches the Ivy mansion and a small aging woman comes out to greet them petting a black stuffed cat. Quetzee Harpell.

The group is given a quick tour as Quetzee is made aware of their need for the Wardstone, they are shown the Mini-farm and the Ox and Cart is taken into the Barn and shrunk.

The group settles into the Fuzzy Quarterstaff and orders drinks from the magical ordering gem.  Patches gets a nice Svirfneblin wine to sip on and Buumi is taken by a young woman in the corner of the room, he goes over to mingle…

Fey chats with the wizards

Patches then heads into town and gathers rumors, hears there are issues at the mini farm and the "Bidderdoo" side of the Harpell family is "riled up"

Group pays 200g to have Gaspren Harpell work up a new wardstone.

Fey Anon, Penelope Harpell and Quetzee work and enchant a blindfold for Tark, that when over the dead eye, lets him see with that eye as if by Detect Magic spell.

In the evening of the second day, the group is surprised by a yell, and going to investigate, see an ancient wizard holding the door to his room shut and appearing frantic.  Harkell Harpell accidentally summoned a Demon, though he claims he tried for an Air Elemental.

The group enters the room to see a massive Balgura demon before them, it charges, the wards meant for an elemental doing nothing to slow it.

The group makes extremely quick work of the Demon, with Gundren killing it with a critical shot from his Thundercannon to it's chest.

As it dies, it's eyes cloud over and it says: The Planet Born Dead waxes and it pulls it's puppets strings. The Goat Prince commands and his children are reborn; one of Gold, one of Adamantite and one of Obsidian.  The Prince stirs in his prison, hearing the music of the ancient sphere. It will call, and all will answer. All shall know loss, and be united in shadow.
