Gundren Rockseeker awoke in the Tavern of Doors, surrounded by pillows and lying next to an unconscious, scarred halfling. Looking around, he saw a meditating high elf, a drow, a wood elf, a half-elf, and a cat-thing. He shook the halfling awake — JmJm bolted upright yelling, only to have his mouth quickly covered. The commotion woke the rest of the group anyway, with a drunken Buumi poking his head over the couch to observe.

Tark discovered he was blind in his left eye.

## Mr. Pickles and the Astral Goblins

At that moment, the goblin Mr. Pickles walked in carrying drinks. Startled, Tark killed the goblin with a flurry of blows and a snapped neck. Buumi, feeling bad, healed the goblin with a lay on hands, and Mr. Pickles got right back to work as if nothing had happened.

The goblins that had been living in the Tavern of Doors for about a week now had blue skin and solid black eyes — they were becoming Astral Goblins, transformed by the box's extradimensional nature.

## The Sleepers

Strangely, Doctor Breakfast, JmJm, and Lothli wouldn't wake up. Fëanon investigated and determined that their minds were trapped in the Shadowfell during sleep. There was nothing the party could do, so they kept the three comfortable and pressed on.

## Return to Cragmaw

Gundren convinced the group to return to Cragmaw Castle for his gear. The only way into Wave Echo Cave required a wardstone, which he'd had commissioned in the wizard town of Longsaddle — and it was the reason he'd been kidnapped. Standing in nothing but his long johns, Gundren requested a weapon and was given the axe Hew.

Tark, distraught over his injuries, left the Tavern to mull things over alone. Outside, a disturbing fog was dissipating in the morning sun.

The group sneaked back into Cragmaw the way they'd left, making their way to the throne room. Through the keyhole, they could see the bugbear chief sleeping. Patches crept through the door — a hobgoblin standing on either side — invisible under the Piwafwi cloak she'd taken from Tarla. She snuck up to the chief and attempted to assassinate him. The bugbear kept shifting just enough to survive each strike, but she finally slit his throat.

The hobgoblins drew their swords as the rest of the party kicked open the door and charged in. Gundren buried his axe in one hobgoblin's stomach while Fëanon finished it with magic missiles and tagged the other, which then took a crossbow bolt from Patches. Buumi stood in the doorframe with his sword drawn, never having gotten a chance to swing it.

They looted the 200 gold the Doppelganger had paid for Gundren and recovered his artificer gear: his schematic book, pack, splint mail, ammo magazine, and his thundercannon.

## The Road to Longsaddle

The party set out through Neverwinter Wood toward the main road, bound for Longsaddle — three days away. The sleepers still hadn't woken and looked increasingly distressed.

On the first day, they reached the ruins of Conyberry and followed a path to the lair of Agatha the banshee. Flattering her sufficiently, they learned that the spellbook Sister Gisele sought was no longer in the area. On the way out, the group purchased a pair of spidersilk bracers from Agatha's treasure — one for Tark, one for Gundren.

The second day was uneventful until they stumbled across two arguing Ettins concerned about the mists and wanting to head east. Patches distracted them with a natural twenty and the group continued on.

## Moot

On the third day, nearing Longsaddle, they spotted a figure approaching on the road. They met Moot — an elderly monk attended by a flock of seven golden canaries. He served the group tea, chatted warmly, and asked Tark to spar.

The two fought, and Tark found himself enjoying it despite his injuries. One of the canaries, Ysera, took a liking to Tark and decided to follow him. Moot mentioned the upcoming Neverwinter Festival of Refounding and said he'd like to see the group there after they finished their quest. When the party detected magic on his staff, it radiated with tremendous enchantment. Moot ended the sparring match with a Ki blast and remarked to Tark that study and perseverance would reveal all secrets.

Tark was feeling considerably less despondent by the time Longsaddle came into view — the town spread out ahead with the Ivy Mansion up on a hill to the left, a small bridge crossing a river in front of it.

## The Ivy Mansion

Tark stripped naked and jumped in the river, apparently no longer troubled by his blindness. He was, the party noted, very well endowed.

The moment they stepped onto the bridge, the group's perception of reality flipped — they saw themselves hanging from the underside of the bridge as they walked across it. Tark, however, saw them walking over it normally while the rest of the group flailed in panic. It was hilarious.

A small aging woman came out to greet them at the mansion, petting a black stuffed cat: Quetzee Harpell. She gave the group a quick tour as they explained their need for a new wardstone. The ox and cart were taken into the barn and magically shrunk. The group settled into the Fuzzy Quarterstaff — the mansion's tavern — and ordered drinks from a magical ordering gem. Patches enjoyed a nice Svirfneblin wine while Buumi was charmed by a young woman in the corner and went to mingle.

Fëanon chatted with the resident wizards. Patches headed into town and gathered rumors — there were issues at the mini-farm, and the "Bidderdoo" side of the Harpell family was reportedly riled up.

The group paid 200 gold to have Gaspren Harpell craft a new wardstone. Meanwhile, Fëanon, Penelope Harpell, and Quetzee collaborated to enchant a blindfold for Tark — when worn over his dead eye, it let him see through it as if under a permanent Detect Magic spell.

## The Demon

On the evening of the second day, the group was startled by a yell. Investigating, they found an ancient wizard — Harkell Harpell — holding his door shut, frantic. He'd accidentally summoned a demon while trying to conjure an Air Elemental.

The group entered the room to face a massive Barlgura demon. The wards, designed for an elemental, did nothing to slow it. Despite the beast's ferocity, the party made quick work of it, with Gundren landing the killing blow — a critical shot from his thundercannon straight through its chest.

As the demon died, its eyes clouded over and it spoke in a voice not its own:

> *The Planet Born Dead waxes and it pulls its puppet's strings. The Goat Prince commands and his children are reborn; one of Gold, one of Adamantite and one of Obsidian. The Prince stirs in his prison, hearing the music of the ancient sphere. It will call, and all will answer. All shall know loss, and be united in shadow.*
