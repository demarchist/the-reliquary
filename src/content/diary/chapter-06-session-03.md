## Splitting the Spoils

The group gathered upstairs in their rooms at the Hopping Hair, staring at their accumulated wealth. Cyrrus looked up from his improvised ledger and simply proclaimed, "We are rich." Cercei immediately strolled over to the sacks of coin and demanded that nobody spend her treasure. The group shared incredulous looks and Buumi stepped in, eventually convincing the little dragon that spending gold on equipment would help them accumulate even more — which mollified the hatchling. Having reduced their load considerably, they split the gold between their two bags of holding, Fëanon taking one and Tark the other.

The idea of shopping came up and the party scattered. Gundren, Fëanon and Buumi would head to the Everfire forges. Cyrrus and Patches would look for an alchemist. The group asked Tark what he planned to do for the day. He answered with a single word: exploring. Cercei was left on her pile of coins with Aurora and Kitty for company.

## The Gate Fortress

Tark left the inn and made straight for the military ward that housed the teleportation gate to Gauntlgrym — the one he and Fëanon had heard about the night before. Approaching the fortress, he ducked into a nearby alleyway and vanished. Two dwarves who had noted his entrance poked their heads in moments later and found nobody there.

Invisible, the monk crept to the edge of the alley and shadowstepped up to a dim section of the parapet. From above, he studied the small courtyard below — a single set of fortified doors, flanked by two guards. He shadowstepped down to the threshold as one of the sentries turned, feeling a breeze that should not have been there. Inside, a fifty-foot hallway stretched ahead with no doors except a set of reinforced mithril and adamantite at the far end. Dozens of arrow slits and murder holes lined every surface. Tark gulped and sprinted forward, silent in Rahadin's boots of Elvenkind, painfully aware that his invisibility would wear off any minute.

At the inner gate he found no handle, lock or keyhole. Thinking fast, he knocked on the doors and then leapt up to press himself into the tight space between the keystone and the ceiling. After agonising seconds, sweat beading on his brow, the gates swung open with a resounding clang. Out strode a dwarf clad in the most extraordinary armour Tark had ever seen — seamless glittering plate with overlapping joints, transparent material in the eyeholes, and a huge battleaxe across his back. Looking more golem than dwarf, the warrior passed beneath Tark without a glance upward.

Tark rolled under the door frame and into the chamber beyond. There it was — the teleportation gate to Gauntlgrym. He shadowstepped on top of the gate and lay flat, watching, hoping for someone to come through. His invisibility wore off, but from his position atop the structure the guards below did not notice. Minutes dragged by. After an hour with no activity, he gave up and decided not to press his luck. Through an arrow slit he spotted the shadow of a table and shadowstepped beneath it, finding himself in the outer ring of the gate's defences — a hallway encircling the entry way, lined with Dwarven guards and massive repeating crossbows. He slipped from shadow to shadow, scouted the space, and eventually found a lever attached to a secret door.

He pulled it. A guard outside grunted at the door opening. Tark activated his staff's flight and shot out in a blur of speed, knocking the helmet clean off a sentry's head as he sailed over the fortress wall and shadowstepped to the floor behind a pillar. Breathing hard and thanking Bahamut, he turned and walked away — only to be stopped moments later by two Dwarven guards who had been tracking him since he entered the alley.

## The Prosthetic Arm

Meanwhile, Gundren and Buumi followed Fëanon to a small workshop near the Everfire itself. Inside they met a Dwarven enchanter by the name of Megno Slatesunder, an old acquaintance of Fëanon's. Initially apprehensive at the sight of the Illithid mask, Megno relaxed once Fëanon took it off and greeted him as a friend. Gundren was immediately entranced by the contraptions within the workshop, and Megno was astounded by Gwen — Gundren's thundercannon.

After exchanging pleasantries, Buumi got to the point: could a prosthetic arm be made for him? The four sat down and began drawing up schematics, chatting for hours as the day wore into evening. By the time they returned to the Hopping Hair to meet the others, they had a solid start on a design.

## The Alchemist

Cyrrus and Patches took it upon themselves to resupply healing potions. Disguised — Cyrrus as a dwarf with a beautifully braided beard, Patches as her usual moon-elf — they wandered to the Artificing Terrace, an out-of-the-way district thick with cloying smoke, smog and the sounds of experiments going wrong. They found a modest establishment run by a spectacularly rude gnome alchemist. After haggling unsuccessfully, they left several thousand gold poorer but carrying a handful of powerful potions.

Not content to have been both gouged and insulted, they called over two guards and spun a tale of illicit goods and watered-down potions, pointing at the shop. The guards — who had heard complaints about the gnome's attitude before — marched in to have a chat, only to find the proprietor had vanished. Meanwhile, Patches slipped into a side alley, climbed to the second storey and broke into the alchemist's bedroom. She spotted a small lockbox beneath the bedside table and pocketed it just as she heard the gnome re-enter through a back door, swearing he had forgotten something, right as the guards called out for him. Patches dove out the window, landed in a graceful crouch, and strolled out to Cyrrus. They turned and walked briskly away, leaving the gnome to his troubles.

The pair headed to the surface so Patches could visit Abalaba again. Cyrrus, fascinated by the underworld, tagged along. At the Sloppy Sahuagin they found the back room empty and Abalaba's office open. Patches fenced the lockbox in exchange for more poisons. Neither of them could crack the gnomish lock, so Patches stuffed the keyhole with a blackpowder charge and simply blew it open. Cyrrus rushed in thinking there was trouble but was quickly put at ease. They left with their goods and headed back to the Hopping Hair.

## Reunited

Back at the inn, the group reconvened — Tark arriving with two guards in tow who wished to confirm his story. The others vouched for him and the guards departed satisfied. The barkeep, however, had overheard the tale of the infiltration and was less amused. Once the whole story came out, the Dwarf told Tark bluntly that this was the farthest east gate and the network would not take him to his imprisoned master. He berated the monk for his escapade and returned to pouring drinks.

The group took a few hours' rest before Patches called them together. Knowing the cycle of the moon, Cyrrus already understood what was coming and swore to assist any way he could. Patches explained her need: to cleanse herself of the cursed weapon she bore. Every one of them agreed without hesitation.

## The Cleansing Ritual

The group headed to the surface, to the ruined cathedrals and the hallowed ground within. Four shattered temples surrounded the old plaza — and Buumi strode without hesitation to the ruined Temple of Helm. Inside the skeletal remains of the cathedral, the white stone altar still stood intact. Patches set up her ritual there, the full moon beaming down and glittering off the gemstones arranged before her. Cyrrus lit incense and began a rite of his own to further hallow the ground. The rest of the group took up positions around the altar and waited.

Patches began, smashing each gemstone atop the cursed dagger with an enchanted mallet, reciting an oath to Eilistraee. As the last hag's tooth shattered upon the blade, the Reaver itself shattered — an explosion of mist and frost radiated from the altar, coating everything in opaque whiteness. When it cleared, a black carapace caught the moonlight atop the altar. A Drider stood there, bearing Patches' face.

Faced with her greatest fear, Patches recoiled as the abomination attacked. The group leapt in, but every weapon blow against the Drider-Patches sent sprays of blood that spawned swarming spiders. They dealt heavy damage, yet the creature ignored everyone but its namesake, pressing its assault with a flurry of poisoned attacks. Retreating, Patches flung down a card from her Deck of Illusions, summoning a goblin that began hollering and hopping in place. The group turned to crush the swarms — smashing, burning and blasting them — but each strike on the Drider spawned more.

A shout rang from the cathedral entrance and a female Dwarven cleric — Nora, Gundren's cousin — rushed in to assist. She healed Patches of the poison coursing through her and then moved to aid Fëanon and Gundren. With the venom cleared, Patches drew the Luck Blade and Strahd's rapier and charged her greatest fear. Rogue and Drider exchanged blow after blow in a blinding display of swordsmanship, each deflecting the other in showers of sparks — until Patches found her mark, lunging and driving the blade through her doppelgänger's heart. The monster crumbled and the swarming spiders vanished in an instant, leaving the cathedral frosted and glittering under the moon.

Nora asked if there was anything more she could do, and the group grew suspicious. When she winked, her eyes flashing green and cat-like, they knew they had been tricked. Tark rushed forward and struck, but the Leanansidhe merely touched him and he froze. The Archfey shed her disguise, revealing the true form of a beautiful red-headed Eladrin, and addressed the group: her debt with Patches was repaid, but Gundren and Fëanon now owed her. She vanished in a flurry of snow and a blast of wind before anyone could argue.

## The Obsidian Blade

Over the altar, the shards of the Reaver melted into a pool of mercury that slowly shaped itself into a levitating disk of liquid metal. Patches was drawn to it. As she approached, the disk rose, casting light across the ruined cathedral and bathing her in its glow. Her hair lengthened, her form became more lithe, and she levitated to meet the disk. She reached into the liquid metal — up to her shoulder — and drew out a glittering obsidian blade that solidified in her grip. Her very skin and eyes shone with a rich lustre as she floated gently back to the ground, now bound to Eilistraee through her new weapon.

As the blade finished forming, a single drop of mercury struck the altar and burst into blue flame. Cyrrus looked into the fire and knew what he must do. He gathered the remains of the tooth fairy and every tooth he carried and cast them in.

The flame shot across the intervening space and lanced into his eyes. The warlock screamed and collapsed, blinded, his flesh-and-blood eyes burned away and replaced by chrome orbs. The group rushed to their friend and discovered the damage was permanent. Despondent and shaken, they returned to the tavern — Patches now bonded to a goodly goddess, and Cyrrus seemingly punished for his past transgressions.

## A Month in Sundabar

The group remained in Sundabar for the next month. Buumi, Fëanon and Gundren spent their days at Megno's workshop, and over the course of those weeks they crafted something remarkable — a metal cap and brace affixed to Buumi's stump that generated a glowing, humming hand of energy upon command, not unlike a mage hand. Buumi teared up and thanked his friends, feeling some of the weight of Barovia lift from his shoulders.

Tark trained in the military wards and drew quite a following, becoming a regular fixture as training dwarves lined up to try their hand against the halfling in the ring. Patches made trips to the Uppercity to practise with her revolver and explore the power of her new weapon in private contemplation. Cercei followed her father around, trained with Patches, and otherwise slept and ate her way through the month.

Cyrrus spent the entire time locked in his room. Everyone tried to console him — Patches even stopped by to offer to smoke with him — but all were turned away. Eventually the month drew to a close and the full moon rose again. That night, the warlock was visited by visions: a halfling pulling teeth from a corpse in Neverwinter, a red-robed mage transmuting a heart into a cascade of teeth in Thay, an Elven samurai having retainers rip teeth from fallen warriors in the far east, and a Derro collecting teeth on the edge of an Underdark battlefield. Cyrrus woke knowing that he must find these other warlocks of Cerregorach and convert or kill them. Blinking his metallic eyes, he found he could see again — not in colour, but in starlight.

He descended for the first time in weeks to a chorus of enthusiastic greetings. The group marvelled at his new sight, and he reluctantly agreed that the test was only beginning.

## The Road to Silverymoon

Word came that the blizzard raging for the past week had finally broken. The group decided to take the Under-road to Silverymoon — both Fëanon and Buumi made it clear they had business there. Gundren's brothers chose to remain in Sundabar with their kin, setting up a permanent workshop and bidding their brother farewell with hopes he would visit soon.

The group departed the Dwarven citadel and after many miles of well-defended, well-lit tunnel, emerged onto the surface for their first view of the city. Ringed in silver walls, with metallic towers, columned buildings and majestic trees — all blanketed under two feet of snow — Silverymoon was enchanting. They trudged a quarter mile along the Sundabar road to an Elven inn and stopped for the evening. Inside, the cuisine proved disappointingly light on meat, which vexed Buumi, Tark and Gundren. The group produced the ewer of feasting and conjured a proper meal, to the chagrin of the innkeeper, and enjoyed the evening before retiring for the night.
