The group entered the huge mushroom inn, seeing all manner of Goblin inside.  Doc .b noticed that Demetrius, the huge Malk was serving drinks at the bar and he decided to go and chat with Demetrius.  Buumi followed, not trusting this hive of scum and villainy…  Fey'Anon saw a huge elf across the bar, bigger than he had ever seen before and went over to investigate.  Meanwhile, Cyrrus spied a set of tiefling twins across the way smoking hookah and went over to see them.  As Buumi headed to the bar, he scooped up the newly wormified team mates and handed them over to Fey.

Doc B. chatted with Demetrius, finding out that he owns the establishment, and wants to hire the group to go steal his property back from The Goblin King while the group steals JmJm. Seeing as the group would be retrieving goods for their rightful owner, Buumi has no issue with the quest.

Cyrrus meanwhile chats with the two tieflings, discovering that they are trapped in the relative safety of the inn, and are looking for assistance in escaping the demi-plane.

Fey'Anon chats with the enourmous elf Barbarian, who decided he finds Fey interesting and tags along.

Buumi meanwhile has been drinking heavily at the bar, riling the Goblins up into a fervor.

Doc.B inquires to Demetrius about the other cat person she saw - Kazoo. Demetrius seems a little scared of her and her HUGE battleaxe but mentions that she absolutely loves clams and trades Doc a bucket of them.

Heading to Kazoo, Doc B hands over the Clams and we discover that they may in fact be related, possibly Gnome-sisters.

When the group discusses what to do next.  They discover a similar thread to all the quests - everyone has been wronged by The Goblin King.  Keying on this, Fey'Anon attempts to rile up the whole tavern to come with the group as a veritable army.  They are really into it - until the group remembers how exhausted they are and that they need to rest.

The group decides to try to swing the nights rest as  to "party before battle!".  The Goblins aint buying it until Buumi pounds two shots of Goblin Brew, and promptly passes out.  The goblins party, the group rests and the next morning, everyone departs - the group, goblins and NPC's (tieflings, Elf and Kazoo).

As the group rides from Goblin town, astride giant tigers and Chocobos, Doc.B notices something strange, a small mushroom that she pulls up and finds a small fairy-like creature that seems to really like her.

The group heads out onto the bridge to the Labyrinth.  While galloping on ahead, Buumi spots a small evil looking creature - like a gnobbly old man with a big Red Cap.  Remembering stories of the RedCap Fae and their love for murder, Buumi goes to pursue, but just as he calls out to the group, the evil Fae vanishes and a huge Troll climbs out from under the Bridge to block the groups path.

The other Goblins scatter in terror, but Buumi charges, leaping at the Trolls face astride his war-tiger Borealis.  They gouge it's face deeply and Buumi smites it with a powerful blow, but it just roars in protest and swats Buumi, hitting him powerfully.  Doc.B swipes at it with her Flame Blade, scorching it's stinking flesh and preventing it from regenerating.

Fey'Anon leaps forwards and manages to ensnare it with hypnotic power, holding it long enough for the entire group to surround it and prepare a deadly strike.  Buumi hits the Troll with an empowered two handed swing, and Cyrrus blasts it with a point blank Eldritch blast, which splatters it's head.

While the group heads below the bridge to see if it had a treasure hoard, Buumi pulls out a torch and begins to set the bits of Troll alight to properly kill it.  The Npc's look on, impressed at the power of the group.

Underneath the bridge, the group finds a magically sealed chest, piles of poo and Fey finds another of the friendly little fairy creatures.  Back atop the bridge, Fey notices the glimmer of a key in the bog and snatches it with his mage hand.  They then unlock the chest and find two potions and some gold.

Making it over the bridge, the group then finds a massive wall, hundreds of feet high and seemingly endless to their left and right.  Over the wall, they see thousands of doors.  The group tries several, but none open.  They chat with a little slug creature who swears there are no doors but convince him to go check the other side of the wall.  The group then remembers Foxxy Crazy's riddle, and realize they must wait until sundown or sunrise.  They set up a makeshift camp to wait the few hours to Sundown.
