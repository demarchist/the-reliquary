The mushroom inn was packed with goblins of every description. The group split up to work the room. Doctor Breakfast noticed Demetrius — the massive Malk from the tea party — serving drinks behind the bar and went to chat with him. Buumi followed, not trusting this hive of scum and villainy. Fëanon spotted an enormous elf barbarian across the room, bigger than any elf he had ever seen, and went to investigate. Cyrrus found a pair of tiefling twins smoking hookah and sidled over.

## Gathering Allies

Demetrius, it turned out, owned the establishment. He wanted to hire the group to steal his property back from the Goblin King — a job that conveniently aligned with rescuing JmJm. Buumi, satisfied that they would be retrieving goods for their rightful owner, had no moral objection. The tiefling twins were trapped in the inn and wanted help escaping the demiplane. The giant elf barbarian found Fëanon interesting and simply tagged along.

Doctor Breakfast asked Demetrius about Kazoo, the cat-creature from the cauldron shop. Demetrius seemed frightened of her — particularly her enormous battleaxe — but mentioned she loved clams and traded Doctor Breakfast a bucket of them. When Doctor Breakfast delivered the clams to Kazoo, the two discovered they might be related. Possibly gnome-sisters.

The group noticed a common thread: every quest they had picked up led back to the Goblin King. Fëanon seized on this and attempted to rally the entire tavern into a war party. The goblins were enthusiastic — until the group remembered they were exhausted and needed to rest first. They tried to spin the evening as a "party before battle." The goblins were not buying it until Buumi pounded two shots of Goblin Bog Brew and promptly passed out. The goblins partied. The group slept.

## The Bridge Troll

The next morning, everyone departed together — the group, their goblin allies, the tieflings, the barbarian elf, and Kazoo — riding giant tigers and chocobos out of Goblin Town. Doctor Breakfast plucked a small mushroom from the ground and found a tiny fairy-like creature hiding inside it, one that seemed to adore her immediately.

On the bridge to the labyrinth, Buumi spotted a gnarled little creature ahead — a knobby old man with an enormous red cap. He recognised a Redcap, one of the murder-loving Dark Fae, and called out a warning. The creature vanished, and a massive troll climbed from beneath the bridge to block their path.

The goblin allies scattered in terror. Buumi charged astride Borealis, gouging the troll's face and landing a divine smite. The creature roared and swatted him back. Doctor Breakfast scored it with her flame blade, searing its flesh and preventing regeneration. Fëanon ensnared it with hypnotic power long enough for the group to surround it. Buumi drove an empowered two-handed swing into its midsection and Cyrrus blasted its head apart with a point-blank eldritch blast. Buumi set the remains alight to ensure it stayed dead while their allies looked on, visibly impressed.

## The Labyrinth Wall

Beneath the bridge, the group found a magically sealed chest, piles of filth, and another small fairy creature. Fëanon fished a glowing key from the bog with mage hand, unlocked the chest, and claimed two potions and some gold.

Beyond the bridge stood a wall hundreds of feet high, stretching endlessly in both directions. Thousands of doors studded its surface, but none would open. A small slug creature insisted there were no doors at all. The group remembered Foxy Crazy's riddle — *when night turns to day and day to night, you'll find the key with guiding light* — and realised they needed to wait for sundown. They made camp at the base of the wall.
