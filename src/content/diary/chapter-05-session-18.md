title: Escape from Ravenloft
chapter: 5
chapterTitle: Barovia
session: 18
summary: "The group fights a running battle up the towers of Castle Ravenloft — past stone golems, skeleton archers, and the relentless Peytr — losing Steven to a pendulum trap and the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind to Peytr's thrown axe. When Rahadin triggers Patches' dormant possession, the group flees into the storm and teleports to Argynvostholt, where the bones of Argynvost open a portal to the dragon's hidden sanctum. Inside, the Tome of Strahd reveals the devastating truth: Rahadin killed Tatyana and framed Sergei."

## The Tower

Patches hurled a smoke bomb down the corridor as Peytr and his entourage ascended the far stairs. Cyrrus cracked his new Staff of Power against the stone floor and a shimmering wall of force materialised between them and the pursuit. The group piled into the tower and began climbing — Patches leading, marking traps she could not stop to disarm, Buumi and Gundren guarding the rear. The crystal heart pulsed above them, shaking the tower with each beat.

Buumi and Gwen lost their footing. Patches shot a web down to catch the paladin. Fëanon conjured a wall of ice beneath the sliding clockwork lion. Tark grabbed Gwen's mechanical tail and hauled her back to safety.

Below, Peytr seeped through the wall of force as mist and began his ascent. Cyrrus sent a lightning bolt down the stairwell — it rebounded off the barrier and devastated the corridor, destroying one shadow hound. Fëanon froze the two vampire champions in place with a mental assault, but Peytr charged through. Gundren greased the steps. Cyrrus shaped the wall into a slide that pitched the vampire into freefall. Peytr threw his obsidian axe into the group — catching Fëanon, Steven, and JmJm — then transformed into a bat to arrest his fall.

Above, skeleton warriors shot down at Patches and Ireena. Tark shadowstepped from group to group, attacking and pitching them off the stairs. The crystal heart beat again, shaking the entire tower.

## The Bridge

JmJm reached the landing at the crystal heart, glanced at the massive pulsing organ, and wisely decided not to smash it. He rushed through the door to the rooftop bridge — and stepped on a pressure plate. The pendulum blade swung down and cut Steven cleanly in half. JmJm took a gash across the face. He stumbled backward in the rain, saw his beloved goblin servant in two pieces, threw his head back, and screamed denial to the storm. The power of the Goblin King consumed him.

Tark shadowstepped back to the bridge railing. Patches darted past the transformed JmJm to help haul the monk to safety. She looked at the dead goblin and the sprung trap. "I guess you found it," she said.

Below, Buumi turned the undead with Helm's power. Peytr recoiled. The group reunited on the rain-swept bridge. Buumi picked up Steven's body and said the wounds were too severe to reverse. JmJm shrunk his harp to a small brooch — he had always forced Steven to carry it — and gathered what remained of his friend.

Rahadin appeared on the far tower, framed by the storm. He told the group they had reached the end of the road: hand over Ireena, the Holy Symbol, and the artifact, or die.

Cyrrus began casting flight on everyone. Rahadin locked eyes with Patches and spoke into her mind: *"Now."* The trigger for the Geas that Buumi had already lifted. Patches smirked. Rahadin's confusion twisted to rage. He screamed *"LENANSHIDHE!"*

Patches' eyes went pitch black. Her hair turned blood red, floating as though underwater. She wailed and charged Ireena, the Reaver forming in her hand. The group tackled her. Tark restrained her with martial arts, activated his staff's flight, and carried the possessed Drow into the storm. Fëanon paralysed JmJm — still in Goblin King form and enraged by Steven's death — scooped him up, and flew.

Buumi fumbled for the invisible Ireena — JmJm had hidden her — and found her hand. Rahadin charged, scimitar drawn. Peytr emerged from the tower behind them. Buumi lifted off, Ireena in one hand, the Holy Symbol in the other, summoning sunlight.

As he turned to flee, Peytr hurled his axe. It struck the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind and the artifact detonated in a blinding explosion. Ireena became visible and fell. Buumi drifted unconscious. His crumpled shield — containing the fragment of the Last Word — tumbled into the darkness. Cyrrus dove as a giant raven, catching Buumi and then Ireena. Fëanon freed JmJm from paralysis to snatch the falling shield from the air — intercepting it moments before Strahd's dimension door could claim it.

In Tark's arms, the possession ended and Patches went limp. Gundren and Gwen faded into the mist.

## The Flight

The group flew through arrows and ballista bolts, the storm robbing the shots of accuracy. Through the rain, they spotted their wagon driven by Ezmerelda, Mr. Pickles, and Chekhov, flanked by the war tigers and a bedraggled Urwen. They landed and the wagon turned. Behind them, Castle Ravenloft erupted — hunting horns, spectral horsemen, shadow hounds, millions of bats pouring from every tower.

Ireena tended Buumi in the back — his left arm was missing from the elbow down and he was peppered with shrapnel. Fëanon began inscribing a teleportation circle as the wagon careened down the mountainside. Chekhov and Mr. Pickles fired crossbow bolts at the horde. Cyrrus created illusory wagons at every fork to split the pursuit. Tark and Patches fought off any vampires that got through. Urwen transformed between raven and human mid-flight to loose arrows. The dragon skull's rune flashed a destination into Fëanon's mind — Argynvostholt.

As the last pursuers closed, the group dove through the portal. The wagon lost control and plunged off the mountainside behind them.

## The Sanctum of Argynvost

They emerged before the ruins of Argynvostholt with the horde banking toward them. Fëanon led in the guise of Argynvost, the bag of holding open so the revenants could feel their master's bones. The entire manor erupted with movement — every revenant and ghost preparing to meet the darkness. The group placed the dragon skull in the mausoleum. It glowed with warm light, then vanished. A column of holy radiance resolved into a doorway. Patches shielded her eyes and piwafwi. Mordenkainen teleported in at the last moment and rushed through with them.

The portal closed behind them. They stood in Argynvost's private sanctum — a vast hidden chamber with mahogany columns, marble ceilings, bookshelves, and non-detection wards on every wall. A teleportation circle was the only way in or out. A third of the room was occupied by a massive pile of treasure.

Ireena deposited Buumi in a plush bed. JmJm slumped against the far wall, laid Steven's remains before him, and wept. Patches and Cyrrus found the treasure — art, thousands of coins, minor magic items, and a set of black leather armour with a herringbone pattern outlined in mithril strips and runes.

Mordenkainen read the final entry of the Tome of Strahd:

*"I... am betrayed. My heart breaks to even write this. Tatyana... is dead. She fell from the highest tower mere hours ago. Rahadin says that he saw her sprinting the tower steps, followed by an irate Sergei... I cannot believe... yet Tatyana's fall was seen by many... I... cannot... Sergei?"*

He turned to Sergei's journal and read the last two entries:

*"My brother returns home tomorrow. I rejoice, but I also quake in terror. How can I tell him, how can I explain our love... our child? She is sure, she says that she is indeed pregnant... I must tell him, I must beg Strahd to take it as his own, and I will exile myself from this land."*

And then:

*"Rahadin came to me. He says Strahd killed her... he found out, and in a rage... I CANNOT BEAR THIS! I WILL AVENGE MYSELF UPON HIM! THE POWER OF LATHANDER IS WITH ME!"*

Mordenkainen set the books down and looked at the group. The conflicting accounts told a single story: Rahadin had murdered Tatyana, told Strahd that Sergei did it, and told Sergei that Strahd did it. Brother turned against brother. A good king was driven to become a monster. And the demiplane of Barovia was the prison built to contain the result.
