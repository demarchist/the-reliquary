Cirrus has a fitful night’s sleep

He dreams of the same Dark Shore as before, with the endless coils of the eel Zalaam, swallowing Fawden.  

This time however, the howls of pain are an agony to Cirrus, and it rends at his mind.

There’s a flash of imagery and Cirrus awakes, beading with sweat.

He saw an image of his mother, imparted by Fawden for some reason

And the knowledge - they have 4 days until Vecna consumes Fawden.

Cirrus rushes to where Gundren has set up debugging the gate and finds the Dwarf just wrapping up - he’s on the last check, but completely exhausted.

As Cirrus berates Gundren for slacking (and feeling the time crunch), manages to attract the rest of the group

They all gather and discuss their next steps while Patches, Gundren and Feanon scour the gate, triple checking it for issues with Hasrala.

Feanon assembles the gate with Telekinesis for the check, and then disassembles it into Radii for transport.

It looks good.

Doc B arrives from his private chambers and the group greets the small Druid happily

Doc has been assisting Bashir in rebalancing the natural world around the city.  As a result, all of the farms are bursting with growth.

They ask if the Gnome would be able to Wind Walk them far to the South West and Doc agrees heartily.

While this is happening, Jareem comes to the chamber to meet with Tark and pulls the Halfling aside.

He gifts a small Ruby Scale to the Monk and says that others of his kind (Crystal Dragons) may sense it, and seek him out as friend.  If he needs to talk to Jareem, the Scale can cast a Sending once per day.

He also gives the group a crystal dagger, one his agents in the Obsidian Order will recognize as a token from him.

Jareem wishes the group luck and then leaves.

The group gathers themselves and prepares to Wind Walk far to the South West, to rendezvous with the Obsidian Order Elves fighting against Vecna, at their camp near the temple of Fawden.

Doc gathers everyone in the main chamber of the Golden Tower, and with a swirling vortex of winds, the group rushes across the land

They travel many thousands of miles in only a few short hours - The barren and desolate landscape of Al’Askar stretching before them as they rush across mountain, plain, badland and swamp, to the far southern sea of silt.

As they approach the area Doc was told about, they see a Khonsfa beetle shake itself out of the sand dunes, three figures attached to it.

As the wind, they descend and reconstitute on the gleaming sand dunes of the Sea of Silt.

Not thirty feet away, the massive Khonsfa stands with a Thri-kreen driver and two Elves in full desert gear watch the group wordlessly.

Recovering from the trip quickly, they approach the elves. (having a slight kerfuffle over the dagger Jareem gave to them as a sign of trust).

The elves pull down their sun-goggles and look at the group - having just arrived via a spell not cast in this world for a thousand years.

With the dagger presented, the Elves have proof who the group is and they are invited into the camp.

They must take the Khonsfa down beneath the sands, but it can only take four or five people at a time, so the group goes in two trips.

The first group goes.

They grasp the leather on the saddle and the beetle vibrates through the sand.

Cirrus cannot hold on and has to Mold Earth his way down, until he rejoins the group

They find themselves in a set of artificial underground caverns seemingly grown from twisting, rootlike basalt.

The Khonsfa returns topside and ferries the rest of the group down beneath the sands.

In the cool, dark cavern they see a huge chitinous form in an alcove, guarding the entrance to this complex - a massive Thri-kreen warrior with swirling chitin-plate and glowing inset sourcestones.  It’s huge, easily fifteen feet tall and akin to an engorged preying Mantis.

Tark can hear its song of welcome

They enter the Elven camp

They find the Elven camp to be arranged in a circle around a central chamber - a great hall.

The outer ring of the camp acts as a “street” with all the dwelling tents set up within.

The group is shown to a dwelling where they can stash anything they may want and take a break.

They look around - they are being stared at by a good two dozen elves.

Patches in particular is getting a lot of curious looks.

Tark heads to their neighbors to break the ice and the group follows his lead.

They chat with the nearby elves, eating a meal of Jilli (spicy Grub guts) and Khonsfa nectar

Thorna tries to cast a spell and causes a wild magic surge. A nearby Elven spellcaster counterspells the surge and admonishes Thorna

They get a lot of dark looks

Thorna complains about getting a drink

They are shown (somewhat exasperatedly) how to drink from the catchpockets of the tents.

Feanon looks around for spellbooks and sees none, but notes a great many arcane focuses and component pouches.

Not wizards, but definitely spellcasters

They inquire with the elves who they should talk to and are directed to the Great Hall to talk with Umu.

The group finishes their meals and then head to the central chamber

Inside they find another two dozen elves, drinking, discussing and generally (reservedly) carousing.

In the center, around the glowing embers of a fire, are a number of grizzled looking elves, all attending an ancient looking crone.

The oldest elf any of them have seen, Umu takes note of them and beckons them over.

She introduces herself and mentions that it has been 900 years since she has seen a Druid, and locks eyes with Doc B.

The ancient elf begins to tear up and moves to excuse herself

Tark asks if its allergies?

Umu barks out a laugh and moves to sit back down, apologizing for her shock

She is not a druid herself, but a Shaman.  She trained under the last Druid before he was murdered.

Thorna asks Umu if she can sense anything about her past.

Umu has no idea, but says she will ask the spirits

The group begins to talk and it becomes clear that Umu is most interested in Patches.

She takes the Dark elf’s hands and inspects them, remarking that in many ways, she appears to be kin, save the purple skin.

Umu hisses and recoils, remarking that an ancient curse lies in her blood and she asks Patches of the history of her people.

Patches does her best to recount the tale of the final Crown War - of Lolth(Aurushnee-something) betraying the Lord of the Elves (Corelly-something) and cursing the blood of the Drow with the blood of a Demon.

Umu remarks that there might be a way to cleanse the curse, but it would require changing Patches tattoo of betrothal (she did not know what it meant when she got the tattoo).

The new tattoo would be infused with magic.

Patches thinks this a great idea

Umu is disheartened by patches account of the Crown War and grows quiet, pondering.

Cirrus has had enough stalling and prompts the Elves - they seek to go deeper, to the Temple of Fawden, and they could use a guide.

Umu is taken aside by Cirrus and convinced of the need of the journey.

Umu even says that if they can indeed deprive Vecna of Fawden, her tribe will offer them magical tattoos as thanks.

A single elven ranger will lead them into the Subterranean Depths - Ms. Ahmahd (red)

She gestures and an elven maiden in recon gear appears out of the shadows.

Thorna asks about her history, and Umu steps aside to conduct a ritual to ask the spirits.

When she returns, she tells Thorna the answers to her questions.

Her destiny lies in the frigid north of Faerun.  And she is not alone.  She is one of two.

The group gathers themselves and their things and with no time to waste, follow Ahmahd to the far end of the encampment, and a single tunnel leading down.

The tunnel moves through a defensive labyrinth of traps and twists, past another Thri-kreen warrior and then through another small gauntlet of defenses.

Ahmahd is moving quickly.

Just as the group is clearing the twisting, grown caverns of The Obsidian Order, they note a sprung trap.

They peer through the dark and note a freshly crushed simian forearm.  Heavily muscled, pale, and hairy.

Ahmahd pulls down her veil and grimaces.  

She whispers:  “Nasnas”.
