After taking a short rest, JmJm, Doc. B and Lothli heading into the box to recuperate further, the rest of the group decided to open the orange sarcophagi.  Placing the orange crystal into the pedestal, the sarcophagi slid open with a rumble and three wraiths immediately attacked the group.  After a short battle, in which Buumi discovered he could wreath his sword in lightning, the Wraiths were destroyed.  Buumi sanctified the remains and the group looted about 200g worth of jewels from the sarcophagi.  Unbeknownst to the group however, Cyrrus - the Tiefling Warlock, and new member of the group, stashed and stole 160g worth of gems as a gift for his Archfey patron.  

After witnessing the Warlocks power in another fight, Buumi decided that he needed to know the source of the power and called upon divine favor to make the knowledge known to him.  He discovered that Cyrrus' Patron is a Wild Fae responsible for the legend of the tooth fairy.  A sinister being that collects payment from mortals with the offering of teeth.  In order to appease his master, Cyrrus must make regular payments to Mediocris Dente, as much treasure as he can along with a tooth under his pillow at night.

Not particularly thrilled at this, Buumi informed the group.  The group decided to press forwards to escape the ancient ruins and continued through the ancient hallways.  Ascending to a level they had yet to explore, the group decided to slow down and begin checking for traps.  Finding several, they made their way deeper into the complex.  Eventually coming to another stair, and another trap, the group gathered around seeking a way to disarm it.  After several moments, they figured they should just mark it and step over the trap rather than trying to disarm it, and thus avoided the trap and continued upwards.

Seeing a large Saurian-humanoid statue down the long hallway, the group headed towards it, accidentally triggering a trap.  The head of the statue hinged upwards, and a bolt of magical energy seared into the group burning them.

Eventually, the group made it to a pedestal, blue crystal adorning it.  Placing the blue gem stone in it, the group then continued into a large chamber.  The chamber had a large pedestal at it's center, several crystal orbs adorning it.  Many paths led off the main chamber and a large door with a white eye seemed to be the focus.  The group determined that they had to insert each colored gem into a pedestal to infuse the central plinth with every color to create white energy to open the final door.   Exploring each hallway, they proceeded to place each gem, coming across many traps, triggering some and taking wounds, and avoiding many others.  At one point, Tark was forced to shadowstep out from a spiked pit before he was impaled.  In another, Buumi was skewered by several poisoned barbs.  Eventually, each pedestal had a colored gem and the main room glowed with white light and the final door opened…
