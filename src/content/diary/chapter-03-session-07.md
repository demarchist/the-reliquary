While JmJm, Doctor Breakfast, and Lothli retreated into the Tavern of Doors to recuperate further, the rest of the group decided to deal with the sealed sarcophagi. Placing the orange crystal into the pedestal, the lids slid open with a rumble and three wraiths attacked immediately. After a short battle — during which Buumi discovered he could wreathe his sword in lightning — the wraiths were destroyed. Buumi sanctified the remains and the group looted about two hundred gold worth of jewels. Unbeknownst to the others, Cirrus pocketed a hundred and sixty gold worth of gems as a gift for his patron.

## The Tooth Fairy

After witnessing the warlock's power in another fight, Buumi decided he needed to know the source. He called upon divine favor, and the truth was revealed: Cirrus' patron was a Wild Fae responsible for the legend of the tooth fairy — Mediocris Dente, a sinister being that collected payment from mortals through offerings of teeth. To appease his master, Cirrus had to make regular payments — as much treasure as he could gather, along with a tooth placed under his pillow each night.

Buumi was not particularly thrilled. He informed the group, and they decided the best course of action was simply to press forward and escape the ruins.

## The Trap Gauntlet

The group ascended to an unexplored level and began checking for traps. They found several, disarmed some, and marked others to step over. A large Saurian-humanoid statue at the end of a long hallway caught their attention, but as they approached, a hidden trap triggered — the statue's head hinged upward and a bolt of magical energy seared into the group.

Working their way through the ruins, the group placed colored crystals into pedestals throughout the complex. Each hallway brought more traps: Tark was forced to shadowstep out of a spiked pit before being impaled, and Buumi was skewered by several poisoned barbs. Eventually every pedestal was activated, the central chamber glowed with white light from all the combined colors, and the final door opened.
