Tark and Fëanon found themselves alone facing Sha'Alazzi. The small bald man smiled — "the whole group would make it too easy" — and mentioned he'd even brought in Lothli from the woods. Forty-five seconds later, a flash of light brought the tower party back. JmJm, Doctor Breakfast, and Gundren headed into the Tavern of Doors to rest while the others exchanged stories. Patches gave the short version, mentioning demons. Buumi corrected her several times that they were, in fact, devils. Sha'Alazzi bid them farewell and left to attend to other customers.

## Festival Day

The group headed into the tent-lined streets of the festival. A brawl erupted from a nearby beer tent — eight combatants drunkenly stumbling and flailing. Tark attempted to weave through using his monk training, dodging blows until a barstool crashed into his back and sent him stumbling out the other side. Fëanon put four of the ruffians to sleep with a spell. Two more had already passed out from drink. The last two, finding themselves the only ones standing, declared drunken victory and went back inside for another round.

Buumi wandered back with a large flagon of ale. Still annoyed at being corrected about demons, Patches convinced him to keep his helmet on at all times.

## The Alchemy Tent

A large red tent drew the group's attention — a magical glass potion bottle hung suspended above the entrance, spewing multicolored bubbles into the breeze, while a man in a brilliant red outfit breathed fire and ice for the crowd. Inside, they met Fandoodle — a small gnome with enormous bushy eyebrows who grew excited upon hearing that Tark had recently consumed a Potion of Fire Giant Strength. He struck a deal: urine samples after drinking rare potions in exchange for discounts. The group bought a Potion of Frost Giant Strength at a discount, and Patches picked up eight doses of Burnt Othur poison.

## Raylen's Tent

Past Sha'Alazzi's pavilion, a smaller purple tent caught their eye. A dashing Moon Elf named Raylen leaned against a post outside, his amber eyes widening at the sight of a Drow and Wood Elf walking side by side. Inside the artificially darkened tent, Raylen flicked a coin to Patches — she caught it and recognized a Bregan D'aerthe insignia. Smiling, he showed them the back room: Underdark weapons, armor, and even a caged manticore. The group browsed but bought nothing.

## The Drunken Lord

A foppish drunk lord accosted them in the street, brandishing his rapier and challenging all comers. Tark loudly volunteered Buumi, who staggered forward — very drunk himself — to engage in a fistfight. In the split second it took the lord to register he was facing a fully armored paladin, Buumi punched him square in the face, forgetting he wore the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength. Bone crunched. The lord dropped. Buumi high-fived Tark and knocked him to the ground.

The group stashed the unconscious lord back in his beer tent, relieving him of a signet ring, a diamond, and a bracelet. Buumi was coerced into the Tavern of Doors, stumbling and crashing down the stairs. His snoring reached the street within seconds. Nearby bystanders chuckled — the lord had been annoying everyone. One older woman caught Patches' eye, then blanched upon realizing she was looking at a Drow and hurried inside her tent.

## The Spell Emporium

The spell emporium was housed in a tent of cloth that looked like liquid mercury. A small blue slimy Spectator greeted them and warned against theft. Fëanon noted the tent was extradimensional, yet the Tavern of Doors inside it didn't rip a tear in spacetime. He theorized the box wasn't a pocket plane at all — it was a portal to somewhere else entirely.

Fëanon perused spells with the help of an illusory assistant. The group sold the foppish lord's signet ring and bought the Geas spell. At the back, a dragonchess tournament was underway. Tark spotted the winning move and called it out, striking up a conversation with a nearby patron. After the game, he was greeted by Penelope Harpell of Longsaddle, who asked about their adventures and mentioned Harkell had returned to the Ivy Mansion in a huff, researching endlessly.

## The Martial Tournament

Unable to wait any longer, Tark dragged the group to the arena — a stone fighting ring surrounded by wooden bleachers. A fight between a large unarmed man and a gambesoned swordsman was already underway; the fat man threw his opponent from the ring to great applause. Tark, Patches, and Lothli signed up and headed to the contestant waiting room.

There they found Moot, who greeted them warmly. His golden canaries chirped and circled, getting reacquainted with Ysera. Moot heard about their adventures and claimed he'd see Tark in the final. Tark discovered that Ysera's presence sharpened his senses — granting him an alertness he couldn't achieve on his own.

The qualifying rounds began, best of three. Tark immediately put his opponent down in a flurry of blows. Patches ambushed hers. Lothli had a harder fight, taking punishment before prevailing. The second round went similarly — Tark dominated, Patches struck from the shadows, and Lothli slugged it out with a sword-wielding dwarf. All three advanced to the tournament proper: Tark versus the Knight Verith, Patches versus Gasciogne, and Lothli versus Hendrell, Champion of the Moonwood.

## Evening at the Moonstone Mask

With the sun down, the group headed back to the Moonstone Mask Inn. They encountered two intertwined wagons and arguing drivers — one asked them to rough up his rival, but the group refused. The remaining merchant paid them a few gold for helping recover spilled goods.

At the inn, Patches spotted her tournament opponent Gasciogne and got him spectacularly drunk until he passed out. Tark noticed Lord Penterghast of Waterdeep amid admirers. The group took contracts from Captain Bastillon — 700 gold to investigate missing sailors at the docks — and from Jasmond of Canderberry, who wanted them to investigate Raylen's tent for evidence of criminal activity.

## The Assassin

Deciding they weren't as tired as they'd thought, the group headed for the docks. Turning down a side alley, they found two hooded figures close together. One dropped to the ground, unmoving. The other dashed to a nearby building and began to scale it. The group peppered the fleeing figure with projectiles, nearly pulling him from the wall. Tark, Lothli, and Patches gave chase across the rooftops.

Tark missed the second jump, smacking his face into the wall and tumbling into the alley below. Lothli made the leap but was struck by a crossbow bolt and collapsed — Tark caught her unconscious body. Patches cleared the gap and closed on the assassin, only to feel a dagger pressed against her back. "I thought we had a deal?" the assassin whispered, noting she was Drow. Patches heeded the warning and withdrew.

Lothli was gravely wounded. The crossbow bolt was poisoned — she worsened quickly. The group rushed into the Tavern of Doors and woke Buumi, who pulled the bolt, laid on hands, and neutralized the poison. Enraged, the group suspected Raylen — the bolt was of Drow design. They stormed back to his tent but found it empty, the back room inaccessible. Patches talked them down from burning it, revealing Raylen's Bregan D'aerthe coin and reminding them that the Black Spider's Drow in Wave Echo Cave had been of the same organization.

Instead, the group visited the thieves' guild pavilion Patches had identified earlier. The halfling proprietor Benny waved them over. The group complained about the sloppy assassination and their nearly killed friend. A rogue at a nearby table foolishly proclaimed responsibility, and Benny banished him for his stupidity. Calming tensions, Benny offered jobs — an art heist being planned, and a lord who needed convincing to leave Raylen alone. Buumi, uncomfortable with the whole affair, left the tent.

Tark bet his new magical ring that Lothli would win the archery competition. Benny accepted, setting the payout at 10,000 gold.

The group headed back to the Moonstone Mask and retired into the Tavern of Doors for the night.
