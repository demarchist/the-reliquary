Tark looks upon the great stonegiant standing beneath the magnificent crystal heart of the library.

The librarian introduces himself as **Ustova, Archivist of the Future**.


The massive giant is easily twenty feet tall and wears elegant Purple robes, matching the Amethyst before him.

The giant smiles and invites Tark to touch the great crystal and peer into the future, though he warns Tark that it will be hard on his body and mind.

Tark asks about what he will see and the giant responds with “possibilities”.

The Monk steps forward and takes a seat, preparing to meditate and attune to the Heart of the great library…


Back in the main foyer, Gundren peels off from Feanon’s conversation with Vizerion/Elias and follows Patches and Buumi toward the chamber of the present, intent on finding some more artefacts to assist the group in their quests.

Catching up with them, they all note that they do not trust the Drow archwizard they just met and that his giant Frog demon is rather disconcerting.


Buumi though is confident they could easily smite the thing but admits he knows nothing about “Slaad” other than that they’re a type of Fiend from the plane of Limbo.

Walking through the corridors of the library, they think they see some movement out of the corner of their eye: a retreating heel or hem of a cape, the swish of robes etc. but no one sees anything clearly.

Looking out through a doorway in the hall, Gundren sees the curving marble archives; massive “shelves” of stone with thousands of cubbies holding untold numbers of glowing rubies.

As he watches, one of the stones dims and loses its color and glow and a Galeb Duhr arrives and takes the dimmed crystal.

Shrugging and shaking his head at the strange place, he catches up to Buumi and Patches just as the hallway ends with a grand doorway leading into an incredible sight.

A great chamber opens before them, an almost perfectly spherical chamber made from smooth ruby.

Near the bottom of the chamber, is slopes down slightly to the bottom of the sphere, where a veritable mountain of massive pillows (and dozens of smaller ones) have been set up.

Reclining on the pillows is a female giant in crimson robes, her eyes are almost closed but rolled back into her bald head and flickering back and forth as if in a dream.

In her lap is a glowing ruby crystal and her hands are placed on the crystal sphere of the room, a Galeb Duhr waits patiently nearby.

The trio approach, descending the incline down to the pillows and ask the Galeb Duhr what is going on.

It explains that the Archivist is in a vision of the present and if anyone wishes a similar vision, they need only meditate while maintaining contact with the ruby sphere.

Gundren and Patches both head to the pillows and lay down, touching the crystal floor of the place and beginning to attune to the chamber of the Present.

Buumi decides that they shouldn't all be in visions and sits, guarding his friends as they begin to scry.


Feanon faces off with Vizerion in the foyer of the great library.

He sits back, looking over his erstwhile “friend” and notes Orla’s wand on the Drows belt.

Feanon points it out, asking what happened to Orla, their old colleague.

The Drow smiles a wan smile and remarks that Orla had some aggressive things to say when she discovered he was a Drow, she attacked him, trying to prevent him taking Theodemir’s tome on Distortion magic.  She did not survive her aggression…

Feanon studies the drow, trying to get any indication of a lie, but it appears that the Archmage is telling the truth: Vizerion as Elias stole Theodemir’s tome and when confronted by Orla, they battled and she died, he then returned to the Underdark and traded the tome to the Acadamy of Sorcere, in exchange for a Wizards tower outside of Menzoberranzan’s cloying society.

Feanon follows up asking why Vizerion is even here at Gravenhollow.

This perks the wizard up and he sits forward, and begins to talk.

He points out that the Underdark is in chaos and the Demon Lords are running rampant.

This must end.

He has a solution and is here finishing up the spell the fix the issue.

But he needs help.  He offers to Feanon that they work together to fix this issue, for old time’s sake and invites Feanon and his companions to the Tower of Araj to discuss the plan.

He is vague, but mentions that the plan involves the Demon Lords destroying one another.

Feanon is skeptical but tentatively accepts.

Vizerion smiles and says he will send a message and/or his bodyguard (gesturing to the Slaad) when he is ready for the group to visit.

The two then take their leave from one another, both confidently swaggering away and Feanon touches a vein of ore, summoning a tunnel to the chamber of the past and walks through.

Travelling the corridors is relatively fast and in a few minutes, Feanon finds himself walking out into a massive diamond sphere, identical (though he doesnt know it) to the chamber of the present.

Across the chamber, another doorway is visible and Cirrus can be seen entering the sphere at the same time.

Fea and CIrrus walk down the curving slope to the pile of pillows, noting the giant sitting there crosslegged, engaged in visions of the past with a diamond in its lap and a Gelb Duhr nearby.

It explains the process as the others have and Feanon and Cirrus both sit and begin to meditate, intent on seeking answers from the great library as they delve into the past…


Tark finds himself in deep meditation, something that he is quite familiar with.

This time however, he can feel the presence of the library surrounding and supporting him, buoying him with power and intent.

His own intent, is to see visions of the future and the entity that is the library grants it.

Seeing the future like a window, Tark pushes through to the next moment, which creates more windows, he pushes through which creates more and more and more.

The monk is quickly overwhelmed by the untold possibilities and he feels his mind breaking under the strain.

It takes all of Tarks discipline to remain focused and push through, and with the help of the library, begins to see the futures he is interested in.

He sees the future Zhengyi is pushing towards - a conquered and failing world, the great northern cities conquered and ruined, the last survivors pushed back to the Spine of the World Mountains and the Dwarven strongholds contained there.

He watches as a dark being, humanoid but with multiple crimson arms sprouting from its back, an Iron crown atop its head It floats forwards and with a gesture, rips the life from a battalion of defenders, a host of undead monstrosities, Amnians and Thayans at its back: Zhengyi.

The vision ends and Tarks mind reels.  Can they win? Is there anything they can do to survive? Can he trust his friends, how long until they betray him?

His mind races down this avenue, but every future he sees, his friends stay by his side.  They do not betray him.

Tark is pleasantly surprised by this.

His allies will stay true to him, so what about actually winning?

The web of possibilities expands before his mind and he begins to race through them, desperate to find any future where they can win.

Shockingly, he finds several, though many, many more end in failure.

In one, he sees every member of the group wielding a fragment of the word and battling some monstrous fleshy, necrotic monster at the heart of a dead world.

In another, only one of them wields the artefact, but it is whole.  The power is incredible, but it appears to be killing the wielder.  He sees many variations on this, with each of them wielding it and in each, that person is burned away by the power…

He sees another, with the group leading a heavenly host, empowered by the artefact.

And another where Atropos is dragged back to the Far-Realm in massive chains and re-imprisoned.

And another where the group stands over a burned out Orcus, the Demon Lord’s heart ripped from his chest at the center of a great ritual in Thanatos.

Tark is shocked, there is hope. They CAN win…


In the visions of the present, Patches looks upon the Abyss.

She sees the Demonweb pits, the domain of Lolth.

An infinite layer of the abyss filled with weblike structures and a hazy ambient light filtering through the billions of strands of silk.

It is deserted.

Patches watches for some time before off in the distance, she sees signs of movement.

She watches as a host of spider-like demons, all clad in black glistening carapace, rushes along a particularly thick section of webbing.

As the small army passes underneath the sensor for the vision, Patches pans her vision and continues to watch as the force approaches a portal.

At the edges of a tear from one layer of the Abyss to another stands two female Drow and as many of the Demons pass by them, they reach out and touch them, granting them Drow bodies and weapons before the host moves through the portal and onto a plain of frozen bones.

Patches has a hard time seeing exactly who the female Drow are, but she suspects they may be Handmaidens of Lolth - Yochlol demons.

The vision ends and Patches wakes, though exhaustion washes over her.

She sees Buumi and she begins to recount her vision of the Demonweb pits to him.

Meanwhile, Gundren is deep in his own visions nearby.

First, he begins to search for an artifact passed down through the legends of the Uthgardt Barbarians of the North - The Iron Horn.

The vision races north, to the peaks of the Spine of the World Mountains.

At a particularly large Glacier held within a basin of peaks, the vision sees a mountain peak barely visible above the Glacier.

Coming closer, the peak top is shattered and a cave can be seen going deep into the stone and far beneath the Glacial ice.

As the Dwarf watches, he sees massive ravens leave the cave and circle, each with well over a twenty foot wing-span.

Raven Rock? Well, it seems that the rumors he got from his kin are confirmed, the Barbarian burial site does indeed hold a significant treasure.

He changes the focus of the vision and the sensor rushes south, seemingly for hours.

Rushing over the Heartlands and past Baldur’s Gate, the vision takes Gundren to a city he does not recognize, built along the River Chionthar.

He thinks the name of the place is Scornubel.

What he sees is the poor city under siege, a massive force of Amnians and Calishiites across the river, with the Northern forces of Baldur’s gate defending the city.

Farther up the massive river though, he sees a fleet of black ships moored flying the Crimson colors of the Red Wizards of Thay.  Above the fleet, two Green Dragons can be seen circling.

The vision does not focus on the Dragons though, instead it goes down amongst the Calishiite and Amnians.

Gundren sees what he has been looking for: Efreeti Chain.

Though the legendary armor is currently being worn, by the fiery Efreeti themselves.

Indeed, it appears that the leaders of the Calishiites are the Fiery Barons themselves and the creatures are an imposing sight.

Seven feet tall, crimson skinned and built like weightlifters, all their arms and armor appear to be made of Brass and much of it glows red hot or smoulders.

The vision ends.


Feanon’s mind races back, his intent carrying his vision to the beginning of the multiverse itself.

Though much is beyond his comprehension, Feanon is learned enough and has enough psionic power of his own that he manages to understand enough.

He witnesses an over-deity shaping the universe, watching over it and letting it grow naturally.

Bits of its own power break off and change, creating new deities, races and entities.  Within the budding universe, its own power begins to coalesce and life begins to form.

A particularly bright entity is birthed within the universe and Feanon feels it’s creation resonate within him.  Correllion? The Lord of the Elves maybe?

As more and more entities are birthed and the universe takes on a life of its own, the raw energies begin to grow chaotic.

The overdeity takes them and breaks off a piece of itself to govern and order it, creating the first Weave of Magic and the first god of magic.

Ever curious, Feanon then sends his questions into the far future, to the end of all things.

It ends in silence and ice.

He sees a frozen rock of a planet, the last one.  Nautiloid Illithid vessels barely survive beneath the ice, close to the core of the planet where there is still some heat.

As the heat death of the universe reaches into the planet, intent on snuffing out what little remains, the Illithids in their terror, activate their only hope.

The device activates, scattering the Illithids across time and space as the last planet dies.


Cirrus has a vision of the past that I dont remember….

He awakes from the vision, spotting that the Giant has since left and Feanon is deep within his own visions.

Wanting more information, Cirrus then heads to the chamber of the Present, intent on scrying some important items.

As he arrives at the Ruby sphere chamber, Cirrus sees Buumi and Patches talking down among the pillows and approaches.

The Giant librarian here appears to be awake and reclining.  She is smoking a massive pipe and simply watching.

Patches finishes her tale of the Demonweb Pits and then turns to the giant, noting that the Giantess is smoking a massive pipe and asks for “some”

The giant blows a galeforce plume of smoke into the small Drow, blowing her over.

Ten minutes later, the haze has worn off enough that Patches sits up and begins another Scrying and Cirrus begins his own.

Cirrus begins to search for artifacts of Selune.

The first that he sees is on the Elven Island of Evermeet, in a mountain temple and worn by what appears to be a cleric of Selune.

The elven man’s armor shines, as if made from luminous fish scales and his pure white silk robes seem dull by comparison.

The vision rushes across the sea and beneath the waves and into darkness.

The darkness is punctuated by luminescent underdark Fungi and Cirrus recognizes that the vision is in the subterranean world of Faerun.

It takes him into a subterranean river and there, beneath a large boulder, he sees an ancient skeleton, the skull of which is wearing a silver circlet with a single white gemstone set into the front.

The vision rushes upwards and Cirrus gets a quick view of the surface above the location (South East of Selunia by several hundred miles).

The sensor rushes north and quickly into a recognizable area as the City of SIlverymoon grows closer.

The vision rushes into the temple of Selune there, to a set of ornate white robes, trimmed in gold and set upon a mannequin at the heart of a great shrine.  As the vision ends, the last thing Cirrus sees is a play of color across the robes, like a shimmering Aurora Borealis.

The vision ends, and Cirrus feels exhausted, but he pushes on, there’s more he MUST know.

He turns his mind toward the location of the Last Word, the fragments of power that will help them defeat Orcus and Atropos.

The first vision takes him to the foot of a great mountain on the shores of a twilight lake reflecting millions of stars.

Great winged humanoids and ethereal lights can be seen flying among the skies and great classical structures of gleaming marble and starlight shine among the great trees of this plane.

Celestia.

The vision approaches a massive fortress, built into the mountainside and made of Crystal and precious metals.

Inside, down glittering hallways lined with ornate armor and beautiful works of art, the architecture opens up into a massive chamer.

The chamber is filled with treasure of all sorts and the most magnificent dragon Cirrus has ever seen rests atop it: Bahamut.

The King of Dragons looks up from a great tome set before him on a stand of gold, the Lord of Dragons was reading.

Bahamut looks directly at the sensor and smiles.

The vision changes.

Cirrus sees instead a great pyramid of black stone and bones in a red-tinged sky filled with swirling clouds and great deluges of raining blood.

The Abyss.

Cirrus immediately recognizes the place as the Necropolis of Everlost, the seat of Orcus.

Looking around as best he can, Cirrus sees the vast city sprawling beneath the great pyramid Throne of Orcus, the sides flowing with rivers of freezing blood, great frozen rivulets causing a strange waxy look as it freezes and creates layer upon layer atop the stone.

Around the base of the pyramid roils a vast host of undeath though great giants can be seen walking through and crushing the lesser dead without a second thought.  Four Hierophants of Annihilation, the greatest Balors of Orcus are here, guarding the Obsidian Blood Throne.

The vision moves in and just as it begins to fade, Cirrus spots it, a glowing point of warmth amidst the cold - the Fragment of the Word sits atop Orcus’ throne, the great bone furnishing gleaming with the light of The Word.

The vision then changes, growing indistinct as it moves to a new location

It is hard to see, as if looking through murky water but it appears to be at the bottom of a great pit.

The places oozes with decay and bones litter the place.  A slithering motion can be seen and a great section of the disgusting decay moves.  As it does so, the light of the Word can barely be seen shining through.  It is here, in this place, wherever it is.

The last vision is even more indistinct.

All Cirrus gets is a wall of blue-glowing crystal though seemingly made by mortal hands as the only other visible part of the vision shows a worked, metal-plated floor.

The vision ends.

The group finds that 16 hours has passed since entering the library and they are absolutely exhausted but decide to reconvene in the lobby and at least tell one another what they each found.

Taking hallways back to the Library entrance, the group settles into the comfortably sized furniture near the roaring firepit.  Nearby, at the giant sized lounging area two of the Giant custodians - the keepers of the Past and Future, are eating a meal and talking.

Wanting some privacy, the group touches the veins of mineral in the table and are enclosed in a private room.  They then summon food, a second Tark to enjoy the food with, and then start chatting.

They go over the visions and find that things are not as hopeless as it may appear.

Cirrus puts forth that with Lolth possibly assaulting Orcus’ layer of the Abyss, while Orcus is away is a perfect opportunity to try and steal the Fragment of the Word there.  After all, Lolth is clearing making a play for it.

They decide to do more research on Everlost, as it did not seem particularly survivable for Mortals.  Gundren thinks he can modify the Masks of Clear Breath to at least let them survive there.

First things first though, the group decides that they need to try and get a clearer look at the locations of the indistinct artifact pieces, though from Cirrus’ description, they think that the indistinct Pit shares similarities to Lady Faye’s lead.

Exhausted though, the group wraps up their meals and make decisions on where to spend the night…

Forgot: Patches scried on her mother and saw her family conspiring to capture her by setting bait of a convoy to Ched Nasad led by her two oldest sisters.  Gundren had a vision of Modrons constructing an Instant fortress inside a large Modron structure.
