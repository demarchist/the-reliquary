The group is faced by three massive winged serpents from this worlds Fae realms

The great beasts do not appear violent and instead circle the chamber, calling mournfully

Something about this place is causing them anguish

The group determines with Camea’s help that whatever it is that has the Quetzalcoatlus disturbed is deeper in the ruins.

After a short minute, the magic that brought the great beasts to this realm ends and the serpents vanish

They discuss what to do next, and rest after that surprisingly intense battle comes up, though Feanon is too spent to summon his Magnificent Mansion

Buumi tries to get a fire going and after three failed attempts, finally manages to get the tinder to catch, only to have it immediately dwindle and extinguish

This place is cursed and will allow no fire or warmth, and without it, there’s no chance the group can rest here and the cold will continually sap their strength

They check on the Highstorm outside but it is still raging.

They decide to push deeper into the ruin and perhaps find a way to end this supernatural cold.

Only slightly deeper into the complex, they find a junction, one side is fully submerged in icy water, another way is blocked by an ice wall five feet thick and the other descends into darkness

They decide to send Tark through the ice wall to scout the other side and he shadowsteps through 

Alone on the other side, he witnesses another vision of the ancient ghosts of this place

An epic battle between Phaerimm and the Saurians does not seem to be going well and the commander demands that the Elven Mage, Avitus, summon allies to repel the Aberrant invaders.

The Mage summons an Al’Jin, a high Celestial of ice and radiance and the tide seems to turn momentarily, until the Magic consuming Phaerimm adjusts to the newcomer and counterattack.

Still overwhelmed, the commander demands the Mage perform another summoning

This time, the Mage calls up a powerful spirit from the Shadow realm, but is unable to control both it and the Aldjinn in the midst of battle.

The incantation goes awry and the creatures break free

The Spirit of Shadow tears open a rift, imprisoning the Aldjinn in a block of ice and condemns the souls of all those in the fortress to torment and death…

The Elven Mage flees and the vision ends.

In the center of this once-grand Solarium stands the now ancient block of ice, a dark horned figure barely visible within and the whole thing surrounded and wreathed in purple miasma.

Tark returns to the group to report what he has found.

With rest out of the question, they mull their options until Feanon reveals that he needs something from the Aldjinn

He explains that for the Ritual of Harmony (to fix the Weave and Planar boundaries of this world), one of the ingredients he needs is a Scale of an Aldjinn to represent the Divine.

The group steels themselves, they MUST free the Aldjinn and *request *a Scale.

They return to the junction of tunnels in the ruin and take a moment to explore one of the other tunnels.

As they head down the dark, unflooded tunnel, they discover the way blocked by more ice, though this contains several frozen Saurian skeletons

They decide to blow up the skeletons and just as Patches sets up her explosives, the undead begin to stir!

Patches Satchel charge takes care of them as Feanon detonates it with a firebolt, but the explosion causes the entire ruin to shake and a section of the floor collapses to a lower, flooded level, dunking Buumi in deadly cold water

Buumi manages to climb to safety just as he loses feeling and is dried off magically by Cirrus

Feanon then turns his attention to the Icewall and with a blast of fire, melts it away.

Then with a running leap, attempts to jump the new hole in the floor of the junction and slams into the far wall, barely hanging from the ledge.

He is quickly pulled to safety and the rest of the group follows across with various means.

Camea remains on the far side of the hole, in the entry chamber of the ruin.

The group finds themselves in the same chamber as the Aldjnn and they cautiously move forwards, intent on remaining out of the purple miasma surrounding the Ice block.

A swirl of energies and crackle of ice alerts the attentive group to a new round of cursed Undead

 The group manages to assault the things as they are freeing themselves from the ice or in the case of ghostly Phaerimm - becoming visible or rising out of the floor.

Like the battle in the entryway, it is fierce, with the ghostly aberrations proving to be stalwart foes

With proper positioning and using the hole in the junction as a barrier against the physical undead, the group manages to destroy the Undead and turn their attention to the Ice block.

As they study it, they realize that with the appropriate synchronized casting of Dispel Magic and Greater Restoration, they can diffuse and cleanse the Aldjinn of the accursed shadow spirit and free this place.

They unleash their magics and the Miasma is blown away and the Ice block shattered.

The Shadow spirit attempts to retain its grip on the Aldjinn, but the magics of Selune are too powerful and it is shunted back to its Plane.

All that remains is the Aldjinn.

Its body is humanoid and feminine, made of flowing and shifting blue crystal sand.

Its head sports two graceful tiefling-esque horns

The Celestial cleanses the Ruin of the deadly cold and with the Shadow Spirit banished, the Undead, held in limbo for a thousand years, finally rest.

The Aldjinn is thankful for its freedom and begins to converse with the group

Hearing about the Imposter Zalaam and the current state of the world shocks the Aldjinn and it is more than happy to assist the group, forming a scale from its flowing, sand-like body in the palm of its hand and giving it willingly to Feanon.

They ask if the Aldjinn if it knows of Hohonu, the nearby Draconic demigod imprisoned in the Swamp

It does, and states that it is truly a mighty being.

The group asks for assistance in defeating Hohonu but the Aldjinn refuses, needing to return to its native Plane as it has been gone a thousand years

It does mention though that there are other Draconic demigods that could assist and mentions a great Metallic Wyrm that guards the gateway from the Faewilds of this realm to the Material Plane. 

The group thanks the Aldjinn and it opens a portal and leaves.

The group finds themselves now alone in the ancient fortress, the curse lifted and the deathly cold now reduced to a mere chill.

Buumi breaks out his flint and tinder and begins to get a fire going for a much needed rest.
