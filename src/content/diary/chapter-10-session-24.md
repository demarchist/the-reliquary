The group spends the next two weeks in the Barony, attending to their duties as the lords of the area.

During this time, Feanon researches the Mythallar and has a breakthrough; he understands that it is not damaged, but simply unfinished and that he would need to funnel power and more Prismeum into the Mythallar to complete it.

Tark meanwhile disappears into the forest for two weeks, occasionally meeting up with Buumi who brings him baked treats.

Cirrus meanwhile spends two weeks getting to know his people, walking through the town and providing coin for the Spring Planting Festival - when the local druid comes out of the forest to bless the land.

Buumi and Ezmerelda begin to research the Plane of Fire and the Efreeti, in the hopes of saving the prisoners left behind in the raid.

Gundren takes the weeks to adjust the magical armor of the Efreeti and to maintain his network of informants and traders - adding the barge down in Baldur’s gate into the growing Rockseeker trade empire.

They get news from Scornubel that the Efreeti pulled back after the group stole the Efreeti Chain armor.

Disgraced by losing the armor, the commander of that Tribe; Shal Bartok, was recalled to The City of Brass in shame.

As a result, his vassals have pulled back from the frontlines with their accumulated prisoners and treasures.

This has been a huge boost for the Allied war effort in the area and the group’s renown grows.

During the two weeks, Buumi is visited by the human woman **Willow Aldencroft - **they meet for a meal, she stays over in Patches establishment and then returns to Silverymoon the next day.  Buumi suspects he was being plied for information during the meal, though the conversation was innocent enough, talking about home - Neverwinter.

JmJm returns to the barony, returning from Silverymoon with Gneiss and Chani.

He spends the next two weeks holed up while his retainers head to the Dojo looking for Tark.

Gneiss and Chani find the Shadowmonk and tell him what they found in the East - two dead monks of The Yellow Rose that had come West from Damara.

The two weeks go by quickly and the day of the Planting festival is upon the group.

Wanting to do something special, Feanon visits Jin the Illusionist in town and acquires a Scroll of Hallucinatory terrain - masterfully crafted to be a work of art.

Feanon casts it for the day and all the barony within several miles turns into a beautiful blossoming world of growing plants and beautiful gardens.

Cirrus has no idea what’s happening and freaks out, becoming understandably annoyed at Feanon once he figures out what’s happening.

Patches meditates in her sanctum, fully enjoying the spectacle.

The group goes up to Kossenburg for the day and enjoys the festival.

The Moon elves come out of the forest to join in - Patches recognizing the Moon Elf Druid Kieran from a run in decades ago.

Ale flows freely, pigs are roasted and the winter wines come out to be finished under the beautiful starry sky as the sun begins to set and the full moon begins to rise.

The whole town makes a procession to The Old Stone Druid grove where Doc B attends the Moon Elves in blessing the lands of the Barony to be fruitful.

Cirrus addresses the crowd and they shower him with adoration as he venerates the moon and by extension, the local customs.

The group returns to the village center and parties for the rest of the night, burning a massive bonfire and dancing around a Maypole, the Elves tying some particularly dazzling patterns with their dance.

All of this while the Hallucinatory terrain covers the land in a bioluminescent paradise.

Not wanting to miss another celebration, the group gathers to Cirrus and they Planeshift to Svartalfheim to witness the calling of Moonfire.

In the gorgeous white stone city of Dokkar, under a blazing full moon, the place is subdued in veneration of this holy time.

They are directed to the public gardens on the first tier of the city, open to all. Patches meets up with Finn.

The group hurries over there, but finds that the gardens are much, much larger, their dimensions seeming to stretch and change to accommodate more people and souls.

All around, Dark Elves and guests in the city recline on blankets, basking in the calm glow of the moon and enjoying the fabulous gardens.

A soft thrum of polite conversation fills the air, but quickly falls to silence if willed away by the listener.

Eventually, the group comes to the center of the gardens and the heart of the ceremony. 

Here they witness some two hundred ancient Dark Elf masters in a circle, each wearing pure white robes (not unlike Cirrus’) and reaching to the sky.

A beam of light rises from them up to the moon, motes of starlight and moonlight floating within.

In front of each Dark elf is an item, thing or person.

As the ritual goes on, every so often a mote of light within the beam explodes, like a tiny supernova.

The energy then drizzles down like a soft rainfall, onto the outstretched hands of one of the Masters.

There, it blazes like white fire before cooling to flowing, liquid mercury.

Each of the masters uses their called Moonfire to perform a miracle on the thing in front of them.

Repairing a magical artifact, healing a vicious wound, raising someone from the dead, finishing a work of art etc.

Cirrus looks on in open jealousy, wondering why *he *doesnt have moonfire.

Buumi puts his hand on his shoulder and tells him it WILL happen.  Have faith.

Patches meanwhile realizes something, summoning Eclipse into her hand.

She wills it to change its appearance, blazing with white fire, like the Moonfire she sees before her in the ceremony.

Indeed, several nearby Dark Elves turn curious eyes upon her.

Cirrus is livid as he sees Patches presumably with Moonfire of her own in the form of her Divine weapon; Eclipse.

They watch the ceremony for a few hours, soaking in the atmosphere and reverence of the place.

Buumi enjoys the vibes, meditating and praying in that place.

Feanon decides to ask a question with his magic to the universe.

Casting Legend Lore about The Last Word during the ceremony of Selune and Elistraee.


He witnesses the birth of the universe and the last fragment of that power coalescing into The Word.

Floating in the void for an eternity, it is found by some truly ancient looking alien beings, possibly precursors to the Aboleths.

It remained at the heart of their empire for another eternity, until it eventually fell into darkness and decay.

There the fragment remained, forgotten.

Until a brutally wounded Orcus, fleeing across the planes of existence from Primus, God of Order, stumbled across the ancient ruins.

There, he found The Last Word and took it up, smiting Primus and destroying the god of Order (albeit temporarily).

The power was so vast that Orcus went out in a blaze of glory, the other gods simply biding their time as the power consumed him.

Orcus was burned and almost obliterated by the power, but he persisted, eventually reforming in the Abyss and reclaiming his power.

The Word though was split apart by the Greater Pantheon, the pieces scattered across the multiverse.

One fell to Faerun, smashing the continent and creating the Spine of the World Mountain Range, the power of the thing drawing the Primordial Maegera to the area in the early epochs of the world.

Another, floating in the void of the Astral Plane for millenia was found only recently by the Archmages of Silverymoon and then used in a powerful binding.

Another fell between the fabric of reality, disappearing from the sight of the Legend Lore spell

Another was found by humans in a far off land, possibly even another world at the heart of their magocracy. Fueling great spells this empire flourished, rivalling that of the Netherese with ease, dwarfing it in sheer scale.

Until with all things mortal, the human empire fell to a dark and terrible outside force and the piece of the Word was buried as the Human empire fell into the ocean.

There it was plucked from the depths many epochs later by a Gold Dragon and then delivered across the plane to Celestia and the Kingdom of Bahamut.

Another fell into the Lower Planes, swallowed by fire and molten earth.

Eventually it was found and taken to the lair of the Yugoloths of Gehenna

There they fought over it with the other denizens of the Lower planes for an eternity, until it found its way to the Abyss.

In the conniving hands of the lesser Goddess Kiranselee, the Banshee Queen tried to use it against Orcus, to take over the entire layer of the Abyss.

She failed and the piece was lost to the Prince of Undeath.

The last piece is seen plummeting to a world, leaving a great crater where it lands.

It is eventually plucked from the silt of the sea that formed there by industrial looking humans.

There they took it and begun to experiment on it, using nothing more than alchemy and science.

The last thing the vision sees is the humans constructing a chamber and placing the piece inside, after that, the Legend Lore simply ends...

The record does not continue.

Feanon opens his eyes, absorbing what he just witnessed.

The group gathers after the ceremony ends and they return to Faerun, Planeshifting home.

The group takes a day to absorb their trip to Svartalfheim, and to begin preparing for the next stage of the adventure - tracking down another piece of The Last Word.

As the group gathers in the town center, stocked up on supplies and potions, JmJm gather with his own group of adventurers - himself, Doc B, Gneiss, Chani, Jin and Ezmerelda.

They are heading South, to the war to look for JmJm’s Stephen and to try and recover as many slaves from the Amnians, Thayans and Efreeti as they can.

The two adventuring parties wish each other luck and then Doc B windwalks his group as they all are blown into mist.

The others, now gathered and ready for their own journey, wait for Veygar.

The Duergar approaches, ready to travel and armed for danger.

He explains that they are heading to The Labyrinth, to look for another piece of the Word in the ancient ruins discovered there, at the heart of that part of The Underdark.

Gathering around, their Bags of holding full of supplies, they teleport to the edge of the Labyrinth.

There, they head into the darkness of the Underdark, though it now lacks the abyssal corruption of the previous visits.

Indeed, compared to last time, its positively pleasant with the group spotting threats and avoiding them (minotaurs, cultists and the like).

They find signs of Modron activity, with Gundren finding an intricate piece of machinery that really takes his attention.

So much so that it alarms Feanon who begins to keep an eye on the old Dwarf as he stares, unmoving at the metal piece for long periods of time.

After only two days of travel and never getting lost due to the Drow Pathfinder and Veygar’s own memory of the place, they begin to see signs of architecture.

Distinctly foreign in shape and truly ancient, the walls begin to show signs of being worked.

With unusual complexity, the panels and lines of the walls have occasional metal pieces.

Thinking that the place will likely be trapped, Buumi barges forwards, overconfident and indeed triggers a trap.

A nearby vent opens and dozens of shining, hissing steampowered beetles swarm forth, attacking.

The group makes short work of them but they are shocked by the complexity of the automatons.

Buumi points out that they are familiar and Patches agrees, these are of similar make to the Mechanical Spiders they fought so long ago, beneath the Troll Hills north of Baldur’s Gate.

The group heads into the labyrinth ruins, coming across more traps, disarming some, setting off others (though turned off with a key by Veygar) and ending with Patches marking a pressure plate just as they get to an intersection.

Looking around, they spot another vent, not unlike the last that spewed forth mechanical adversaries.

Intrigued by the ruins and the mechanical enemies, the group waits, mulling over their options as they begin to breach the Outer Defenses…
