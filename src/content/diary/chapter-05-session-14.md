## Finding Mordenkainen

The group pushed up the slopes of Mt. Baratok in deepening snow, battered from the Genoskwa and running on fumes. The tall pines gave way to rocky alpine moss, the snowline only a few hundred metres ahead, blanketed in thick roiling cloud. Stick assured them the Archmage was close — *"Not far now!"* — though the sentient staff's sense of distance proved unreliable. Patches complained bitterly about the cold. The group entered the storm.

They dug and blasted their way through the drifts — Buumi using his shield as a shovel, Tark's elemental ring melting snow, Fëanon's firebolts carving channels, Cyrrus's eldritch blasts knocking banks aside. Minutes turned into another hour. Then Gundren called a halt. Through the howling wind, a huge elk stood fifty feet ahead. Stick squeaked with excitement.

The elk became a man. A brilliant lightning bolt detonated among the group, blowing a crater in the snow. Fëanon, Cyrrus, and Gundren dropped instantly, unconscious and smoking. The storm seemed to halt itself around the battle, the air clearing to reveal a middle-aged bald man with a stark black goatee threaded with silver, standing atop a boulder in tattered robes, hands crackling with arcane energy.

*"YOUR MASTER CAN NEVER BREAK MY SPIRIT!"*

Stick called out to him. Patches, pulling herself from the snow, shouted that they were friends. Mordenkainen hesitated — recognising his staff's voice but unable to place it. Buumi raised the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind and summoned sunlight. Patches, unwarned, was blinded by the reflection off the snow and cursed violently. But the sunlight, the healing, and Stick's insistent mental voice were enough. Mordenkainen lowered his hands.

He led them to an alcove in the mountainside and walked straight through the rock. The group followed into a pocket-plane sanctum — a single magnificent marble-columned chamber with sleeping quarters, a lounge, an alchemy lab, a library, and a banquet table laden with food. They fell upon it.

## The Sanctum

Over dinner, the group told Mordenkainen everything — Kangaxx, the artifact shard in Buumi's shield, the dark entity backing Orcus, Barovia, and the revelation that Rahadin was a silver dragon and brother of Argynvost. Mordenkainen examined the artifact shard without recognition. He took the Tome of Strahd and promised to break its cipher. He studied the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind and Tark's staff from Bahamut but could offer little insight without his spellbook. The ring of mind shielding containing the amber entity troubled him most — the power within tasted of Atropos. The group theorised that the Amber Temple was a prison for shards of Atropos and other dark powers.

After several hours of rest, Stick interrupted to point out something no one had noticed: JmJm was in the sanctum. He had simply appeared. When pressed, the group wrestled with the strange miasma that clouded their memories — people had been coming and going from Barovia at random, and no one noticed or remembered. With effort, some of them managed to hold onto this disturbing awareness, though they could feel it trying to slip away.

Mordenkainen gave them sending stones to stay in contact, provided Fëanon with the teleportation sigil for his sanctum, and saw them off. The group teleported to the frozen watchtower at Tsolenka Pass to await the carriage, huddled around a small fire.

## Castle Ravenloft

The clip-clop of hooves announced the arrival of an ornate black carriage, gilded and satin-lined, drawn by a coal-black stallion. The moment the door closed, it rode into the sky, lifting off the mountainside. The group suspected they were being listened to and spoke carefully, touching briefly on their pasts before falling quiet. The carriage descended onto the Old Svalich road near a pile of ruins — as if a great tower had recently collapsed — and climbed the twisting mountain road to Castle Ravenloft.

The castle materialised through the rain: dark Gothic architecture raking upward, spires lost in storm cloud, lightning flickering behind its towers. Disproportionately tall and sharp, the architecture felt deliberate in its oppressiveness — as if the castle had a will of its own. The carriage crossed a lowered drawbridge between two watchtowers and stopped at the keep's front steps.

Massive iron doors carved with intricate dragon patterns split soundlessly. Warm light flooded out around the dark outline of Rahadin. The elf welcomed them in filigreed armour, torch-light glittering off his ornate weapons. Patches tried to scale the exterior but found no way in except the front door.

The main foyer was black marble with vaulted columns and a great staircase climbing sixty feet. Tapestries and bas-reliefs covered the walls — two enormous dragon carvings flanking the entrance. Rahadin led them east to the dining hall, past bronze double doors guarded by two heavily armed vampire soldiers in full helms, Celtic and Norse designs worked into their armour, red eyes glinting beneath.

The doors swung open to a beautifully furnished room, filled with the court of Castle Ravenloft.

## Into the Lion's Den

Strahd greeted them cordially and asked them to join him. Ireena sat on his right — perfectly healthy. Fëanon reached her telepathically and found her relieved but terrified. On Strahd's left sat the massive bare-chested barbarian vampire they had seen go after Van Richten, a heavy bear pelt across his shoulders, a bone crown on his brow, and a deep red stain around his mouth.

Patches lingered outside, climbing the stairs to the landing before turning back from what she suspected were stone golems, then hovered at the edge of the dining hall. Cyrrus, JmJm, and Fëanon approached Strahd directly. Buumi, Tark, and Gundren took seats at the table to mingle with whatever horrors awaited them.

The dinner at Ravenloft had begun.
