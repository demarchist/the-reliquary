Snorbul looks down at the decapitated head of the cult leader and the constricting tongue wrapping his arm.

He manages to tear it from his flesh and spikes it onto his broom of flying, sending the flying broom into the air away from him.

The tongue lashes out again, striking at Snorbul who lets out a shriek of disgust.

Thorna hurls her hammer and strikes the decapitated head, causing it to fall into the lava and burn away…


Meanwhile, the dragon in his humanoid form moves over to Tark and they begin to talk

The dragon apparently, can sense something unique in Tark’s Ki and mentions that it seems like Tark may have learned some techniques passed down by a Ruby Dragon

Tark’s master was Gaddock, not a dragon, but Gaddock learned in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in Vaasa.  Maybe the monastery was founded by a Ruby Dragon long ago?

The Dragon introduces himself as Jareem and aks where the group is from, as it is clear that they are Outlanders to this world of Gaia

Tark says they are from Toril.  

This surprised the Dragon as it is *very *difficult to get to this world

He mentions that he knows of a handful of Crystal Dragons in Toril and asks where Tark is from.

Tark mentions Vaasa and though Jareem does not say more, Tark can tell that the Dragon recognizes the name of the land.

The rest of the group heads over to the conversing dragon, and they begin to talk.

Jareem looks at each of the heroes and detects something of interest from each of them with his psionics.

Tark - with his aura of Crystal-touched and Shadow-touched Ki

Feanon - Not Elf, or Illithid.  Changed and psionically gifted

Snorbul - A safe harbor for the Source of this world. A Child of nature and balance in a world gone mad.

Gundren - A vessel for two Modron minds; a life-raft

Buumi - A chromatic Dragon consort and protector, empowered by Carthus

Thorna - A Shard of the goddess Auril, but for what purpose was she made?

Cirrus - A child of Dark Divinity, but adopted by the light.

Patches - A cursed Dawn-Elf, touched by the blood of Wendonai, but wielding a glimmer of hope.

JmJm - The man of many worlds, harboring a spirit of pure chaos.

The Dragon came to this world many centuries ago with his Mate.

They could sense a perversion of reality happening here, and as it is in their nature to preserve and stabilize reality, they came here to do what they could to fix things.

It was far worse than they realized and Jareem’s mate - **Ajak **was tricked into wearing cursed armor by **The Lady in White, **a powerful servant of **Zalaam**.

The Armor killed her, and then raised her corpse, transforming it into a **Hollow Dragon. **The Hollow Dragon now guards the City of the Dead - Sharza

Jareem has been trying to find a way to save his mate, and this world, ever since, but he has been (mostly) alone.

He has been working with the Elves of this land for centuries, through a network of spies and agents.

Jareem goes on to say that he originates from **Oerth** the same world as Mordenkainen.

The group asks if Jareem knows the Archmage

The dragon knows of him, but has never met the man personally.

Jareem and his Mate came from Oerth, following a trail from that world, to this one.

Feanon, who had been listening in, has a realization.

He takes control of the conversation, which had been happening psionically, and shows everyone his thought process and evidence.

He shows the visions of a Human Wizard (from what he now believes is Oerth) subjugating the non-magical.  He shows the cults and their iconography, their preference for necromancy. He reminds everyone that **Zalaam **here is supposedly an imposter who came to power here a thousand years ago, orchestrating a calamity, and that the cult leader they just slew, described Zalaam as a brother of Zhengyi and related to Orcus.

There is only one being that it could be.  A being whose cults show up across every world like cockroaches: **The Whispered One, The Undying King; The Archlich Vecna.**

Jareem is stunned to silence for a moment, but with the information Feanon just gave them, he comes to the same conclusion.

Zalaam, god of Death of this world, is an ascended Vecna.

Jareem goes on to describe what he knows has been happening in the wider world:

Vecna/Zalaam is calling all dark things to him, forming two armies - an Army of the dead in Sharza, and an army of Shadowfell monstrosities in Black Sea.

The gods are not just imprisoned, they are being consumed by Vecna.  He has devoured Zalaam, and is almost done consuming Fawden goddess of Chaos - hence the wildmagic and highstorms increasing in frequency.

He does not know how Vecna had the power to consume Zalaam in the first place, but he has heard rumors of the Saurian Artifact at the heart of **Barzak Pyramid**

He learned this at the nearby temple of Vaketh, which he noted was undefended by the Shadowfell creatures that guard the other temples. He went there to cleanse it himself, but was captured by the Cult while he was meditating and communing with the gods there.

He had to dive through the lava to get to the temple but was unaffected by the fire (being a Ruby Dragon).

He assisted the Mortal heroes - The Usurpers of Rudjek in taking back the city of Iyum from the servants of Vecna, leading them to the Artifact **The Hammer of Niraz**.

He had hoped to lead/direct the Usurpers on their own pilgrimage to stop the gods from being consumed, but the Cult of Zalaam has proven a thorn in their side ever since taking the city of Iyum and they have been unable to leave it as a unit.

**The Hammer of Niraz** is powerful enough to work as the **Icon of Power in the Ritual of Harmony Feanon is creating to fix the Weave of Gaia.**

The hammer is currently wielded by Djoser, the Tiefling Warrior who showed up at the crashed Spelljammer with Patches and Thorna, and who left with **Liara **to return to **Iyum.**

**Feanon **asks Jareem what other relics could be used for the ritual.  The dragon mentions the relics of Vecna - The tongue the cultist leader had used on Snorbul would have been one if it was not cast into the lava.  He knows of another though, in the **Citadel of Flesh in the Black Sea**.

The group takes some time to digest what they have discovered.

Vecna is a revelation and many of the group have heard the name before as a dark and cursed being.

Buumi mentions that the Paladins of Helm are instructed to destroy his cults wherever they crop up as they are exceedingly dangerous. 

 If Vecna is here, gathering a dark army and already has a Fragment of the Last Word, this is bad news indeed.

The group aks Jareem if they can help get them back to Toril - they have a lead on a Ringed Veil and coordinates back to their world in **Thueba Swamp** 

Jareem agrees to fly them to the Swamp, in exchange for guarding him while he finishes the cleansing of the nearby **Temple of Vaketh**.

The group agrees.

The group then turns their attention to the** Forge of the Titans** and what drew them to the Volcano in the first place.

Looking around, the find three shortswords of a glittering and iridescent metal they are unfamiliar with.

The magical shackles that were restraining Jareem are of the same stuff, though disintegrated into dust.

The divvy up the swords and Gundren collects a decent amount of the glittering dust.

They also discover a number of items on the nearby altar the cultists had set up.

A number of molds for weapons and armor, a few chunks of Titanite ore, and a massive Onyx Skull of a Storm Giant filled with a dark liquid that was meant to turn Jareem into a corrupted dragon.

After some debate, they pour the dark liquid into the lava and then take the valuable skull chalice with them.

They take the ore and molds down to the Forge below.

There, Gundren deciphers aworkings of the forge with the help of his friends.

Using the great hammer and crucible in the center of the chamber, they refine the Titanite Ore and then implement the molds, even crafting two unique ones. 

Lava pools up from below and if not for the Efreeti chain, Gundren would have burned to death.  Instead though, he operates the forge with skill; forging a Titanium Spear for Tark, Shield for Buumi, Armor for Thorna, Scimitar for JmJm, Tome-box for Feanon and Greatsword for Snorbul.

Gundren also collects a half dozen working firelances for himself, intent on creating a unique weapon from the collected implements.

Heading up from the lava-fueled forge they reunite with Jareem and Patches and overhear that there are many Dawn and Dusk elves in Gaia, Dark Elves who are not cursed by Lolth and do not have the blood of Wendonai within their veins.  They may even have a way to cleanse Patches of the curse.

The group gathers their things and then head out from the Forge, desperate to rest in a place that is nor oppressively hot.

They exit the forge without incident now that the cult is destroyed and make it to where the lava-falls were blocking the bridge.

The lava-fall is gone and the great Worm that was vomiting it forth is no longer perched above.

As they look around, they see the gargantuan thing off in the lava-fields and ruins of the Titanic city writhing and smashing at smaller creatures, possibly some fire-mephits.

With the lake of lava now no longer being fed by the worm, the temple of Vaketh is visible in the distance.

As they watch though, they see dark stains appear in the air - rifts to the Shadowfell.

Remembering their battle at the Temple of Carthus, the group determines that they should rest before heading over there, especially if the Magma Worm is currently rampaging through the caldera of the volcano.

Jareem offers to fly them out of the Crater and on to the slopes of the Volcano, away from the heat and gasses.

Feanon halves the dragons weight to make the flight easier and he thanks the wizard as he is not used to ferrying so many at once.

They fly up and onto the exterior slope of the mountain to set up camp.

Nearby, they see a monument and they move over to investigate, finding an ancient grave marker - marking Pilgrims who died trying to reach the Temple of Vaketh many centuries before.

Gundren pours out his Horn of Feasting, but is thrown twenty feet down the mountain by wild magic.

Grumbling, he trudges back up with a new bruise and the group sits down and feasts

 Refreshing  themselves, the group settles in for a well earned rest with Jareem reverting to his Draconic form and curling up on the mountainside shielding the resting party from the elements.
