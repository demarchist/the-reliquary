The group begins to rest in the cleansed Solarium, it takes some effort, but they get a fire going.

 Luckily, the insects of the Swamp have not moved into the newly freed ruins and they do not disturb the group. 

Camea and Buumi set up a rope across the pit in the floor of the ruin and Feanon then alarms the approach for security.

Patches secures the only other way in and they all begin to rest a little easier.

Feanon however, finds his mind turning toward the Dark tome in his possession.

Exhausted from the day, he cannot resist the pull of the artifact and he takes the book out of its shielding box and begins to hungrily read it.

Buumi is busy cooking, but JmJm and Cirrus’ eyes go wide as they recognize Feanon is relapsing and has lost a battle of wills against this thing.

It has to go.

JmJm restrains Feanon and Cirrus shoves the tome into his bag of Devouring, but the book frees itself somehow and Feanon casts haste on himself and struggles free from JmJm.

Buumi finally notices the kerfuffle and the book, and rushes over with the Hammer of Nuraz and smites the book with a powerful blow, cracking one of the covers in a burst of screams and necrotic energy.

Feanon is then restrained by JmJm’s Bigsby hand but the Wizard dispels it, falling to the floor

Feanon snatches the book with a Mage hand and goes to put it away, but the book doesnt let him discard it.

JmJm then smacks the book to the ground as Buumi rushes over to smite it again and Cirrus summons a Celestial to also assault the Dark Tome.

Under the combined assault, the book is destroyed, the remains imploding in on themselves and leaving nothing

Feanon sags as the influence of the book leaves him.

Buumi comes over and hugs the Wizard, apologizing for not freeing him from the books influence earlier.

Feanon looks conflicted, but decides not to dwell on it

All this time, Patches and Camea have been smoking in a corner, watching it unfold, they rejoin the group for dinner 

Exhausted, the group then rests through an uneventful night.


After a good eight hours, the group packs up and heads from the ancient ruins, intent on continuing West.

They set out with Buumi attempting to lead through faith, but in the unforgiving swamps of this alien world, it quickly goes awry

Led by more competent means, the group gets back on track having only lost a few hours going too far north.

As the day draws on, they come across an interesting set of Standing Stones, the place however is swarming with Allips (undead spirits) and the group decides to go around, losing even more time to avoid battle with the Undead.

Feanon then uses his arcana to try and read the winds of magic and get a sense of the nearest and strongest emanations of magic.  He leads the group to where he believes the Resting Place of Hohonu lies.

After a long, long day, the group makes it to the shore of a wide uninterrupted body of water.

Camea says that it is the Great River and that they near Aina Pulu

To get there, they must cross the mists and the river of the dead.

Intrigued, they let Camea lead them to a small dock and boat run by another halfling.

The ferryman knows Camea and will gladly take the group across the river

Buumi scouts the river, noticing many thousands of corpses beneath the surface and then goes back to report

Camea says not all of the bodies are real, but not to look at the bodies too closely.

They set off across the river, discussing their plans for Aina Pulu

They decide to have Feanon and Buumi be smuggled into the town in Gaseous Form, held by the fake prisoners of Patches and Tark. Camera will then proffer the “prisoners” as sacrifice, to be taken to the ritual site for sacrifice to the Dark Draconic god. Once at the site; Cirrus, JmJm and Gundren will be in the Ethereal plane following using Steeden (the Nightmare), ready to transition back to the Material Plane at a moments notice.

With a plan set, they turn their attention to the dead in the water, using the dangerous curse as a game to see how close they would come to plunging into the depths.

Camea, the Ferryman and Buumi look on incredulously as JmJm and Cirrus risk so much for a true thrill…
