Facing off against ten skeletons, the group quickly rallies into action.  Each arrow from Lothli downing a skeleton, each blow from Tark shattering ribs, Patches dropping behind and destroying skeletons efficiently and Buumi defending his comrades from attack.  During the fight however, an ancient Wight steps through the mists to engage the group but is quickly downed.  During the fighting, Myria takes a stab to the shoulder and she collapses against the wall with a skeleton looming over her about to finish her off.  Patches however disposes of the undead creature and advances on Myria.  Thinking the treachery of the Drow at hand, Myria sneers at Patches, remarking she should have expected treachery.  Patches however simply belittles her and tells her she is out of her league and should go home before stalking off into the tunnels.  Kangaxx through the whole event has fallen into blabbering madness and has to be carried by Buumi, who must also carry the wounded Myria.  Assaulted by another wave of madness, the group manages to shield their minds, Fey determines that the mist is the same spell they have come across out in the wilds - a necromantic mist.  Tark immediately downs the Necrotic resistance potion and feels his mind clear.  Free of the insanity of the mist, Tark takes point, mapping some tunnels and using Ysera to scout as best she can.  Finding many dead ends, but as many clear passages, the group comes to a larger cavern with torn up ground while others come across a room filled with a green slime.  Crossing the torn ground, an Umber Hulk bursts from the ground, attacking Tark, clipping him but dealing little damage.  The group quickly rushes to aid Tark, with Lothli pelting it with arrows and Patches dancing in for the ambush.  The arrows have little effect on it's thick carapace, but a deep wound from Patches cursed dagger and subsequent drawing on it's life force causes significant damage and it flies into a rage.  In it's flailing it opens up an opportunity for Lothli who downs it with an arrow in each of it's multifaceted bug eyes.  Checking down a short side tunnel, Patches finds the ancient mummified corpse of a Dwarven smith, his equipment long having turned to dust.  She does however find a magically preserved scroll tube and an ornate marble box with gold inlay, containing a fragrant ointment (Keoghtom's Ointment).

  Continuing onwards Tark traverses a "crossroads" of tunnels, triggering an ancient trap and is pelted with darts causing numerous wounds.  Now "disarmed" the group crosses the trap and comes to a rotted out "oasis".  The cavern was once a verdant respite in the harsh lightless world, the fog however has caused the whole area to die off.  Patches manages to find a small amount of underdark cave moss and Kangaxx remarks that when he was last through here it was strikingly different - but that their goal is close at hand.  As the group heads through the final tunnel, Tark hears a call for help and goes running to investigate - stopping just short of a drop into an abyss, out of which the ghostly voice is calling.  Resisting it's pull, Tark steps back from the ledge and returns to the group.

  The group exits the tunnels, the mist stopping as if cut off by an unseen force.  Ahead of them looms a massive stone arch, carved directly into the cavern wall.  The cavern opens up and on the left and right, drops off into an unseen abyss, as if the very earth was simply scooped away.  From within the stone arch, a shimmering field of golden light can be seen. Approaching it, everyone is overcome by a sense of calm.  Myria and Kangaxx collapse against the cavern wall, taking a break.  Tark touches the barrier and is gently repelled.  Thinking of the wardstone Gundren made with the Harpells at Longsaddle, Tark rushes into the box to grab it from the vault - stopping off to check in on the Rockseekers but is told to go away.

Popping out and presenting the Wardstone, a flash of gold light illuminates the cavern and the barrier disappears.  Through the doorway is an endless void, just darkness.  Steeling himself, Tark steps through and immediately finds himself in a massive stone room, reminiscent of a grand Cathedral.  The rest of the group approaches the void and steps through, finding themselves in the grand chamber.

Investigating the chamber, they find the Drow Bregan D'Aerthe camp they were told about by Lo'dan. Equipment and goods left as if dropped in an instant.  The goods being transported through here simply being common surface goods that would be exotic to dwellers of the Underdark.  The rest of the room has Murals across all the walls, and two massive marble nude statues down at the end near another arch.  Tark starts to investigate the Murals which depict:

A great, bloated, horned and winged beast lays waste to the land, a shining radiant object in one hand, and a dark and twisted skull staff in the other.  The sun is blocked out by a dark orb and the world is darkened by death.  As life is extinguished, it rises again in undeath and a sickly mist envelopes the world.  The world is not without it's defenders. The great beast  is cast down by a host of light, they battle him into the Abyss itself and the Sun once again shines upon the world.  The siege of the beasts fortress however cannot succeed.  At every turn, he uses the radiant artifact to strike down the strongest of the Celestials.  Eventually a god steps to face him, the radiant artifact seemingly having no effect.  Calling on all it's strength and with all his unholy power, the great beast strikes a massive blow against the god, destroying it and himself in the process.  The Celestials weep at the loss of their greatest hero, but raise the abyssal fortress in victory.  The radiant artifact remained behind however and was borne out of the Abyss by the celestial host.  They then split the artifact into five pieces and hid them across the multiverse…the final panel depicts the beast, sleeping in an egg at the heart of a dark orb.

Patches grows impatient and starts at the last Mural but then gets confused and asks Tark for the rest of the information.  After the group finishes looking at the murals, Tark walks up to one of the statues, and it angles it's marble head to look at Tark, addressing him and greeting the group.  It asks the purpose of the group and tells them that an unknown entity recently tried to gain access to this Vault.  When it could not, it called monsters to it, including a young Green Dragon, with the defenses of the Vault triggered, the Drow were teleported out of the entryway. The entity then summoned the mists and the cultists.  The mists drove the Dragon insane and it left to find the group.  The entity then left as well with the small army it summoned here.  Conversing further with the group, they discover that this place is an ancient vault, containing a shard of some artifact and was created by the Celestials of the higher planes.  The group is allowed to progress further but must pass through a series of trials to do so.

Stepping through the second arch, the group finds themselves in an old growth forest, with old ruins littering the area, scouting a bit, they find the portal to the next area, but it is inactive, requiring two keys.  The group stops for several hours to rest, but remains on guard with the sounds of battle in the distance.  Eventually, the group scouts ahead to check the sounds and comes across a group of Demons battling a group of Devils.  The group pulls back to decide what to do next.  Patches asks everyone not to panic and heads into the bushes returning a few moments later in the revealing robes of a Drow Priestess.  With Mr. Pickles in tow, she marches up the ruined steps towards the battle.  As the last Devil and Demon strike at one another, Stabby erupts from the chest of the Devil, devouring it and Patches marches up to the Balugra, demanding that it take her to it's master, by order of Lolth. Confused but afraid, the demon agrees leading Patches, Mr. Pickles and a stealthy and unhappy-about-the-priestess Lothli in tow.

As the rest of the group is mulling over what to do, two Devils burst into the clearing and are startled to see mortals.  Fey'Anon hails them asking to make a deal, to which they are most receptive.
