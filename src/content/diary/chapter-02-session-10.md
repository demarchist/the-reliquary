Facing ten skeletons in the labyrinth tunnels, the group rallied quickly. Every arrow from Lothli downed a skeleton. Every blow from Tark shattered ribs. Patches slipped behind the undead and dismantled them efficiently while Buumi held the line, shielding his companions from counterattack. An ancient Wight stepped through the mist to engage them but was brought down swiftly.

During the fighting, Myria took a stab to the shoulder and collapsed against the tunnel wall. A skeleton loomed over her, poised to finish the job. Patches dispatched the creature and advanced on the fallen warrior. Thinking treachery was at hand, Myria sneered — she should have expected as much from a Drow. Patches simply told her she was out of her league and should go home before stalking off into the tunnels. Kangaxx, meanwhile, had succumbed to blabbering madness and had to be carried by Buumi alongside the wounded Myria.

## The Labyrinth

Another wave of insanity washed over the group, but this time they managed to shield their minds. Fëanon identified the mist as the same necromantic fog they had encountered in the wilds. Tark immediately downed his Potion of Necrotic Resistance and felt his mind clear. Free of the madness, he took point — mapping tunnels and using Ysera to scout ahead. They found many dead ends but just as many open passages.

The group came to a larger cavern with churned, torn-up ground. As Tark crossed the disturbed earth, an Umber Hulk burst from below, its massive claws clipping him but dealing little damage against his hardened defenses. Lothli peppered the beast with arrows, though they bounced uselessly off its thick carapace. Patches danced in for the ambush, driving her cursed dagger deep and drawing on the creature's life force. The Umber Hulk flew into a rage, its wild flailing creating an opening for Lothli — who downed it with an arrow in each of its multifaceted eyes.

Down a short side tunnel, Patches discovered the ancient mummified corpse of a dwarven smith, his equipment long turned to dust. She recovered a magically preserved scroll tube and an ornate marble box with gold inlay containing a fragrant ointment — Keoghtom's Ointment.

## The Crossroads

Continuing onward, Tark traversed a crossroads of tunnels and triggered an ancient dart trap, taking numerous puncture wounds before the mechanism exhausted itself. Beyond the trap lay a rotted oasis — a cavern that had once been a verdant respite in the lightless world, now killed off entirely by the necromantic fog. Patches managed to find a small amount of surviving Underdark cave moss. Kangaxx, lucid for a moment, remarked that the last time he'd passed through here it had been strikingly different — but that their goal was close at hand.

As the group moved through the final tunnel, Tark heard a plaintive call for help and went running to investigate. He stopped just short of a sheer drop into an abyss, a ghostly voice calling from the void below. Resisting its pull, he stepped back from the ledge and returned to the group.

## The Vault

The group emerged from the tunnels to find the mist stopping as if cut off by an unseen force. Before them loomed a massive stone arch carved directly into the cavern wall. The cavern floor dropped away on both sides into an unseen abyss, as though the very earth had been scooped away. Within the arch shimmered a field of golden light. As the group approached, a profound sense of calm washed over them. Myria and Kangaxx collapsed against the cavern wall to rest.

Tark touched the barrier and was gently repelled. Remembering the wardstone Gundren had crafted with the Harpells at Longsaddle, he rushed into the Tavern of Doors to retrieve it from the vault — stopping to check in on the Rockseekers, who told him to go away.

Returning with the wardstone, Tark presented it to the arch. A flash of gold light illuminated the cavern and the barrier vanished. Beyond the doorway lay an endless void — nothing but darkness. Steeling himself, Tark stepped through and found himself in a massive stone chamber reminiscent of a grand cathedral. The rest of the group followed.

## The Murals

Inside, they found the Bregan D'aerthe camp Lo'Dan had described — equipment and goods left as if dropped in an instant, all common surface goods that would be exotic to dwellers of the Underdark. Two massive marble statues stood at the far end near another arch, and murals covered every wall. Tark began to study them.

The murals depicted a great bloated beast — horned and winged — laying waste to the land, a shining radiant artifact in one hand and a twisted skull staff in the other. The sun was blotted out by a dark orb, the world consumed by death and a sickly mist as life rose again as undeath. But the world was not without defenders. A host of celestials cast the beast down into the Abyss itself, and the sun shone once more. Yet the siege of the beast's fortress could not succeed — at every turn it wielded the radiant artifact to strike down the mightiest celestials. Finally a god stepped forward to face it, seemingly immune to the artifact's power. Calling on all its unholy strength, the beast struck a cataclysmic blow that destroyed both the god and itself. The celestials wept for their greatest hero but raised the abyssal fortress in victory. The radiant artifact was borne out of the Abyss by the celestial host. They split it into five pieces and hid them across the multiverse. The final panel depicted the beast sleeping within an egg at the heart of a dark orb.

Patches, impatient as ever, started at the last mural, got confused, and asked Tark to fill in the rest.

## The Guardian

After the group finished studying the murals, Tark approached one of the massive statues. Its marble head angled down to regard him. The statue greeted the group and asked their purpose, then explained what had happened. An unknown entity had recently attempted to gain access to the vault. When it failed, it summoned monsters — including a young green dragon. The vault's defenses triggered, teleporting the Drow out of the entryway. The entity then conjured the mists, which drove the dragon insane and sent it fleeing toward the surface. The entity departed with the small army it had summoned.

The group learned that this place was an ancient vault created by celestials of the higher planes, containing a shard of some great artifact. They would be allowed to proceed further — but only by passing through a series of trials.

## The Forest of Fiends

Stepping through the second arch, the group found themselves in an old-growth forest dotted with ancient ruins. The portal to the next area was visible ahead but inactive, requiring two keys. They rested for several hours, the sounds of distant battle echoing through the trees.

Eventually they scouted toward the fighting and discovered a group of demons locked in combat with a group of devils. The group pulled back to decide their approach. Patches asked everyone not to panic, then disappeared into the bushes. She returned moments later dressed in the revealing robes of a Drow priestess. With Mr. Pickles at her side, she marched up the ruined steps toward the battlefield. As the last devil and demon struck each other down, Stabby erupted from the chest of the fallen devil, devouring it. Patches strode up to the Balgura and demanded it take her to its master by order of Lolth. Confused but afraid, the demon agreed — leading Patches, Mr. Pickles, and a stealthy and deeply unhappy Lothli deeper into the forest.

Meanwhile, two devils burst into the clearing where the rest of the group waited and were startled to find mortals. Fëanon hailed them and asked to make a deal — to which they were most receptive.
