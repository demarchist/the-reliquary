The mansion burns as the second floor completely collapses, the remaining story groaning under the burning weight.

Behind the manor, Buumi gets to his feet and begins to head back into the burning building.  Ernst notices and grabs his brother, telling him that they're gone.

Patches finishes hog-tying the assassin she subdued and turns to the two grieving brothers.  She agrees with Ernst that his mother, father and brother cannot be saved.

Buumi sags and agrees, knowing that Helm would not grant him another stay of death that night (as he already brought back Ernst).  Buumi notes the unconscious assassin at Patches feet and rushes over, violence in his heart.

Patches holds out her hands to placate the angry Paladin and asks Buumi to give her a hand carrying the assassin.  The anger fades, replaced by confusion and grief and the big man scoops up the assassin, now stripped of gear and hooded with a leather bag.

Patches, Buumi, Ernst and Chani begin to head around the burning manor house to the front, concerned and not knowing the fate of their friends.

Around front, Fey floats in the air, thinking about what he just saw.  Witnessing a proper Teleport confirmed some of his theories and he now thinks he could pull off the same spell. He floats down to the ground and settles near Cirrus, who has decided to take a nap in the now empty, half-disintegrated fountain.  Bending down, Fey begins to examine the warlock, trying to determine what spell was cast on him by Corpsetaker.

JmJm and Doc B cast a few more healing spells on one another and survey the scene.  Doc sees Fey over by Cirrus and remembers the waves of nauseating energy cast upon him and rushes over to help.

Looking over the Warlock with Fey, they realize that Cirrus has been struck with a Feeblemind Enchantment and is essentially comatose.

Fey is revulsed by the spell, one which any self respecting wizard would find abhorrent and Doc prepares to attempt a healing spell.

Above the city Docks, the dragons still tangle, the smaller Gold and Blue harrying the massive Red.  Eventually, the Red decides he's had enough, frees himself from the combat and begins to rapidly teleport short distances, fleeing the area.  Anaxtrasa and Aurinax wing off in pursuit, enacting their own spells to attempt to catch up.

Tark's blindness fades and he sees twenty city guard rushing down the Estate driveway to meet them, led by a hulking Dragonborn.  Tark waves them down and half the force comes to a halt while the rest spread out through the estate grounds. The Dragonborn introduces himself as Kliss.

Kliss asks them their identities but is confused when Tark mentions the Faerun Defense Force and tensions increase, the guards drawing their weapons, not knowing who they face and on edge.

The city is still in chaos.

Tark, not remembering that the wider population knows them only as "The Heralds" begins to get flustered and its not until Fey hands over his writ of nobility that the tension is lessened.

Eventually, the group convenes out front when Patches small group rounds the manor and sees Doc, Tark, Cirrus, Fey and JmJm.  Chani rushes over to the still body of Gneiss laying at JmJm's feet.  

Moments later, Gundren is led around the other side of the manor by two guardsmen, caked in soot and blood and he calls out to Buumi that "Dinner sucked!".

Finally understanding, the city guard realize that these are The Heralds and they ask about Lord Neverember as he was last seen in the Bumidere Estate (as far as Kliss knows).

The group tells the guards that Neverember teleported away at the first sign of trouble.  Kliss recalls his troops, sure now that The Lord of the City retreated to the Keep.  The group decides to head with them, but asks for a second.

While the guards and Kliss wait, Doc B holds his arms up to the stormy heavens and calls on Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness to heal her friend.  A bolt of lightning strikes the right hand of Doc and trembling, he places it on Cirrus' chest.  The warlock jolts and instantly wakes, all wounds healing and his mind becoming free once more.  Doc sags in weariness, his fur standing on end from the static.

Cirrus jumps up to his feet and grabs Fey "SUNDABAR!"

Realizing what the warlock means, Fey enacts the Arcane Recall and the small lead box containing the Artifact appears in his hand, whisked from the vault of Sundabar hundreds of miles away.

Fey peeks into the box and sure enough, it is still there.  A perfect cube of Obsidian with a gold bar through the middle.  Fey deposits the chest into his bag of holding.

JmJm asks Buumi to "Diamond me!" and Buumi hands the Bard the only one he has left, a massive 5,000gp Diamond Patches had "given" him in Silverymoon.

The group out front look at one another uncertainly and then over at Buumi, he doesn't know about Cercei, and they need to tell him.

Cirrus and Fey go over to the Paladin and break the news, focusing on that they at least know she is alive and well -albeit possessed by a very powerful spirit.

The cherry on top of the shit that is Buumi's evening, he simply goes silent and looks defeated.

The assassin had on him: Mask of Clear Breath, Parrying Dagger +1, Leather Armor +1, Cloak of Fire Resistance, Venomous Dagger and  a single charge fireball necklace.

Buumi, Patches, Cirrus, Fey, Tark and an unconscious assassin head with the City Guard to the keep, the only part of the city with the sounds of trouble still audible.

Descending the hill of the Bluelake District, the group gets a good view of the city.  Fourteen patches of fire rage and smoke billows across the city, the Docks are almost completely incinerated and many ships burn out in the harbor.  Despite this, the fires appear to be under control as the group spots wizards enacting walls of ice and water to battle the burning Docks.

Approaching the Keep, they see a "Triage" tent set up in one of the smaller Plazas, Dwarves bustling to and fro.  Approaching, they ask the apparent leader the current situation throughout the city and if they have any word from Sundabar.

The Dwarf, directing the fire control efforts, sends several clerics and engineers off to inspect a smoldering building before responding.  He turns and addresses Tark, telling him that they've counted fourteen fireball detonations across the city, the Docks are pretty much lost and that the Keep and Bumidere estates appear to have been the primary targets.  The bombings were done in the most populated areas to act as the largest distraction.

Fey swears, seeing the act of terror for what it is and asking what the chances are that the attack had nothing to do with the BG second fleet being in port.

The old Dwarf nods and continues, saying that Gauntlgrym sent reinforcements through their Gate to Sundabar, that there was an attack there too but he doesn't know the outcome.

The group thank him for his time and hurry  toward the keep, catching up with Kliss and the other guards.

Arriving, they are ushered through the outer gates by two young, inexperienced and panicked guards.

Approaching the main entrance of the keep, they see why the guards on duty were so young.  All the Veterans came here.  The doors are open and a bustle of activity can be seen within, the sounds of wounded screaming and the stench of blood, cooked meat and ozone flood the area.  Injured guardsmen, in a state of shock, can be seen sitting on the steps, many looking with glassy stares off into the distance.

Heading up the steps and in through the doors, the group gets a good look into the audience chamber of the keep.  Water drizzles and drips in through a massive 15ft hole in the ceiling, going all the way up and through the roof.  Columns are smashed and rubble lies strewn throughout.  A hulking, still glowing metal figure, the size of a hill giant lies still in the middle of the room - a slagged Iron Golem.  Surrounding the Golem, are dozens of corpses, bodyparts and unidentifiable gore.  Several robed bodies can be seen though the majority appears to be those of the Palace Guard.

Taking it all in, the group surveys the scene and spot a familiar face, near the throne of Neverwinter and a large pile of rubble: Mordenkainen.

They rush over and note Stick hovering about a foot away as the Archmage simply stares down at the rubble.  The group notes a compound fracture of the Wizard's right arm, a nasty looking headwound on his pate and Delly's Cat Alfred clutched to his chest in his left arm.  The cat appears distressed, yowling and looking around.

Stick speaks into the groups minds as they approach, saying that Mordy is addled and concussed but keeps waving away the other clerics. 

Cirrus casts a Greater Restoration on Mordy just as Buumi Lays on Hands.  This seems to jolt the wizard and his eyes focus as he turns to address the group.

He begins to tell them what happened at the keep:  He and Delly were eating dinner when they heard a massive impact and rushed to the Audience chamber.  They found an Iron Golem had smashed through the ceiling, dropped from high above and followed in by four Amnian Wizards and a second Golem, the design of which was unfamiliar to the Archmage.  Castle guard rushed to engage but were horribly outmatched until Mordy and Delly led the counterattack.

Fey gestures to the wrecked Iron Golem and asks if it was his handywork and the Archmage nods.  Mordy then gestures to the pile of rubble and says that Delly fell beneath it, to the Golem they did not recognize.

Aghast, Fey instantly asks the rest of the group to help him shift the stone.  They quickly move enough of the stone to uncover the head and shoulders of the Golem underneath, seeing the thing made of white marble, threaded with silver and the large head appearing featureless, a maquette of Marble.  Mordenkainen mentions that wherever that head looked, magic ceased, like that of a Beholder.  His voice cracking, he says thats what got Delly; the gaze negated her defenses.  

Mordy hands the cat over to Fey as the Archmage takes a seat nearby, head in hands.  Fey looks into the distressed cats eyes and wills the poor creature to sleep in his arms.

The clearing of the stone peters out and Buumi talks to Fey.  It's been much more than a minute since she fell, Revivify won't bring her back.  Fey says that JmJm can do it with the rest of that massive diamond.  Mordy says it wouldn't work as she must be "whole"... though they could try and "re-assemble" the pieces... as dark as that sounds.

Patches begins to get nervous, worried her prisoner will awake at any moment and grabs the highest ranking guard she can find and tells him of the situation.  Sergeant Smithwick recognizes what this means and leads the group away from the carnage (and Mordy) and through the keep to a large central tower.  They descend several stories, eventually arriving at the Keep dungeons.

Leading them back through the vaulted chamber, dozens of doors leading off into individual cells, the Sergeant finally arrives at the back of the chamber, where two doors sit in the wall. One made of Shining metal, the other of wood and are about 10ft apart from one another. The guard places a hand on the metal door and it swings outward revealing a perfect cube of a stone room, seamless and featureless save for one wall being glass, another room on the other side accessible from the other door.  The only thing in the room is a single wooden, high backed chair.  The chair has shackles of metal for the hands, feet and neck.  They quickly strap the man into the chair and bolt the restraints.

Fey realizes that inside the featureless room, no magic works and so he, Cirrus and Buumi head to the other side of the glass while Patches insists on interrogating the prisoner.  Sergeant Smithwick is sent for "Tools".

Once Tark realizes that the intent is to torture the man, he demands that they refrain!

Patches tries to negotiate, saying that its more for the implication of torture, but Tark won't budge.

Meanwhile, Fey has finally gotten a good look at the assassin in the magical light of the interrogation cell.  The man is covered in intricate arcane tattoos that appear to glimmer with opalescence. Checking over his spell notes, Fey recognizes spell equations for Gaseous Form and Misty Step.  The tattoos are the source of the Assassins powers.  Fey begins to copy down the tattoos, whole new avenues of possibility opening up to the Wizard.

They begin to question the prisoner as Sergeant Smithwick "takes a walk" after returning with the "tools".

Patches hits the man a few times and then goes in with the hot poker, burning the man on his neck as Tark looks on, scowling.

The prisoner reveals a little bit of information: He was one of many assassins sent by the Shadowthieves of Amn, though none of them knew who else from the guild was on the job, only that anyone also attacking the estate was to be treated as an ally.  The contract was from Shaahir.  Additionally, he reveals that he worked with a cell of two others, though he does not give up the names.

Tark implores the man to divulge information, asking him to fight against Evil and the man simply laughs, reminding the Halfling that he was sent to kill children and he did so with gusto.

The light torture continues and the last bit of information they get is that the assassins cell of operatives were to flee the city by boat, upriver.  The group tells Sgt. Smithwick this (as the man has returned) and the guard rushes off to try and intercept.

Cirrus then asks the group if they could leave him alone with the man, promising not to torture him and the group agrees.  Tark, Buumi and Patches all head upstairs to see if they can help with the damage.

Down below, Fey keeps taking notes and Cirrus enters the room.  He asks the man if he is an "innocent".  The man chuckles and shifts in his chair, showing the warlock a tattoo dedicating himself to Bhaal, god of murder.  Smiling and thanking the man, Cirrus then proceeds to stab him to death with a small dagger.  Leaving the room covered in blood, just as the Assassin expires, Cirrus casts a spell and captures the dying man's soul within a Soul Cage and then prestidigitates the blood off him.

Fey looks in at the corpse, clucks in disapproval and begins to follow the warlock upstairs to rejoin the others.

As they walk, Cirrus asks the soul some more questions, finding out that the boat route out of the city was to head to Thundertree in the Neverwinter woods. They were then to disguise themselves as cobblers and head south along the trade road. The names of the other members of his cell are: Geld Havarafam and Jeof Jeef. 

Fey notes Cirrus put away a small silver cage, glowing with a pale energy as the Warlock stops mumbling to the spirit.

Fey hears a voice in his head as they walk as Megno contacts him.  The Dwarven wizard teleported to Sundabar to help deal with the attack.  He tells Fey that the artifact is missing from the vault, but gasps in relief when Fey says they have it.  Megno then goes on to detail what he knows and asks how Neverwinter is as they saw the blasts from Helm's Hold.  

Mengo says that the Sundabar vault was attacked by eight Oni, each of which had bags of holding filled with undead.  Four Oni went through to the vaults themselves while four others tried to hold a beachhead.  They were all killed, though with heavy losses.  

More importantly though, the last two Oni tried to cause some extra damage before dying and combined their bags of holding to tear a rift into the Astral Plane.  Despite the Dwarves best efforts, they cannot close the portal and worse, it appears to be growing albeit very slowly.

Fey relays this to Cirrus as they walk and Cirrus stops in his tracks, turning to stare at the wizard.  Cirrus asks Fey to pull out the Crystal tuning Fork and goes on to say that it must be a sign from his goddess, he must go to Sundabar with the fork and attune it while the portal is there.  He learned the spell Plane Shift that night and this is too much of a coincidence. Fey agrees and they rush to rejoin the group upstairs.

Meanwhile, upstairs Buumi is chatting with a returned Aurinax (in Dwarf form).  The gold dragon tells them that Ana is outside, circling and watching over the city and asks Buumi about his family.  The dragon offers his condolences to Buumi.  

Tark asks him if he knows the Red dragon they fought and Aurinax says that he does not, though has some suspicions about its identity. 

Mordenkainen is nowhere to be seen.

Tark decides to concentrate on his staff and try to connect or feel some connection with Bahamut.  He gets a vague sense of dread and anxiety.

Aurinax goes still for a moment and then responds to a Sending message.  Addressing the group, he apologizes but he must return to Waterdeep immediately as it too is under attack and he has no spells left to teleport him to the city and must fly.  He leaves the keep, retakes his dragon form and flies from the city.

Buumi looks down as his halfling friend, Patches and them standing in the wrecked audience hall.  Tark tells his friend that Li killed his family too, but that they won't let any more families die.  Buumi agrees and they hug.

Tark steps back from the hug, eyes wide as he thinks of something, then rushes off to the library thinking that a scroll of scrying would be perfect right now. 

Buumi turns to patches and beckons for her to follow him to the library.  Thinking that Buumi was asking for a hug, she feels bad for the man and following Tarks lead, hugs her friend. 

Buumi is shocked and pushes back from the hug, explaining that he simply meant for her to come with him and follow the halfling. 

Annoyed and feeling tricked, Patches shoves Buumi back and storms off after Tark.  Buumi chuckles and smiles a little.

They have to ask for directions, but they find the library quickly in an undisturbed section of the keep.  They enter and come face to face with an old lady in robes and pointing a wand at them.

Tark quickly disarms the situation and the woman asks what happened as no one has come to the library yet.  Tark tells her of the attack.

The woman looks concerned and saddened, but it isn't until the death of Archmage Delly is mentioned that she looks truly distraught.  Quietly, the old lady mentions that "I guess will need to get the books I lent her..." she then asks where she fell and Tark tells her.  

The librarian thanks them and takes her leave, needing to say goodbye to her friend.  Before she goes, Tark asks about scrying spells and is disappointed to discover that the library does not contain any spells.

The group remains in the library for a few minutes and then return to the stairs leading into the dungeons.

As they arrive, Fey and Cirrus are just climbing up from below and tell the group about what they learned of Sundabar and the rift there.  Tark responds with the information that Waterdeep is currently under attack.  They must decide where they are most needed.

As they discuss this, Sargent Smithwick rushes to the group and whispers to them that the Prisoner is dead.  Fey and Cirrus look at one another and then tell the guard that when they left him, he was alive.  Smithwick believes them (as does Tark and Buumi) and rushes off, thinking that another agent of the Amnians must have killed him and may still be in the castle.

In the end the group decides to head to Sundabar as Cirrus is adamant that its what his god demands.  Agreeing that it is quite coincidental, Fey stoops to the floor and begins inscribing his teleportation circle on the marble, brushing it free of dirt and debris.

A minute later, the group is looking down the length of a very large and ornate crossbow, the Guild Mage stationed at the Sundabar Circle aiming down its sights.

With a sigh of relief, the mage lowers the crossbow and tells the group that the city is on lockdown.  He hands them a gold medallion to get up to the vault (as the group is expected) and Cirrus snatches it and begins to sprint through the city, the group barely keeping up.

Medallion held aloft, the party is not accosted but they see that the City is under total marshal law.  It is deserted other than dozens of twenty man patrols in every section of the city, many with a great Stone Golem marching alongside.

Cirrus makes it to the northern vault and looks at the glowing crack in the doors.  The wind blowing around him sucks into the vault, stirring his robes and blue caustic lights play across the entrance, lit by the rift within.

Cirrus heads inside and sees a great hole in the universe and through it he can see the Astral Sea: a swirl of purple nebulae and infinite stars. Cirrus drops to his knees beneath it and holds up the large crystal fork.  

Megno spots the group entering and Cirrus' display and heads over to greet them.  He thanks them for coming and hands Fey over a pair of ruby spectacles.  With the truesight of the glasses, Fey sees the cracks in the planar boundries, just like the ones beneath Helm's Hold.  Megno remarks that they can't close the portal and Cirrus snaps that even if they could, they shouldn't.

Megno recognizes what Cirrus is doing and mentions that it must be held there for 24 hours.  Cirrus offers no complaint and sits there, praying to his goddess.

Fey remarks that these cracks are a terrible portent and wonders if the fusing of the artifact was what shattered the planar boundaries, if it's Atropos, or something else.  

Megno wonders how consistent the cracks are and takes the glasses from Fey, deciding to walk around the city to check and ask the Clan Leaders if they can leave the portal for 24 hours.

The group settles in to wait, the portal surrounded by dozens of grim faced Dwarven veterans.  

The room is absolutely wrecked, with gouges in the dark granite, jagged frost from blasts of cold.  The destroyed bodies of Oni and Ghouls lay strewn about and the tunnel back to the vault has been collapsed.  

The dead and wounded of the Dwarves are already gone.

One hour turns into four without incident and Megno returns.  The Cracks are everywhere throughout the city and they have permission to keep the portal open for 24 hours, but if anything comes through they are to try and close it immediately.  The group agrees (though Cirrus grumbles).

They settle in and eventually eight hours goes by without interruption.  Everyone enjoys a much needed rest save for Cirrus, who remains prostrate before the rift.  The morning rolls around and at Dawn, Fey is contacted by Mordenkainen.

They are to return to Neverwinter for a briefing with Lord Neverember. 
  

The group leaves Cirrus behind with Megno and head back to Neverwinter, utilizing the Guild Teleport Circles.

Arriving quickly to the keep, they find it far different than just a few hours ago.  The rubble is gone, as are the bodies and only the bloodstains and damage to the stonework remains.  

They see acolytes prestidigitating away sections of bloodstain.  

Past the work though, they see a strange man sitting on the steps of the throne.

Fat, with a head shaped like a Potato and small beady eyes, the man is striking in his bad looks. He stands, wearing noble clothes and introduces himself as Hugh, Neverember's Spy Master.

The group follows Hugh into the heart of the castle and up to the Lord's rooms.  They enter to see a large war-table set up in the center, not far away from a massive four poster bed.  

In the bed is a badly wounded Neverember.  With a bloodied leg propped up on a pillow and the mans eyes wrapped in bloody bandages, he looks terrible.

Neverember cocks an ear to the door and welcomes Hugh back, trusting he has returned with The Heralds. 

Neverember growls and swears at the group, damning them for not protecting his family, but the anger fades quickly as he realizes its misplaced.

Tark is shocked at Neverember's state but the pained man chuckles, tapping a gold ring on his hand and mentioning that such injuries are merely a temporary inconvenience.

Fey nods in approval and agrees.

The briefing then begins and Hugh has them stand around a map of Faerun:

1) Thay has invaded their neighbors of Thesk and Aglarond, conquering the former and besieging the latter.

2) Vaasa is in the grip of a terrible Blizzard and White dragons have been spotted there.

3) The Thayan Fleet has left port and are sailing across the Sea of Fallen Stars.

4) The Amnian Army has marched north and taken the city of Berdusk on the Chonthar River with the help of a Green Dragon.

5) A coup has seemingly occurred in Amn with Shaahir coming out on top. He has endorsed "The Church of the Nightmother", a new religion that has been cropping up in the South.

6) The Balduran First Navy is currently engaged in a pitched battle against a massive Pirate armada. They are outnumbered 2:1 and the Pirates have Three Black Dragons fighting alongside them.

7) Baldur's Gate suffered a similar attack to Neverwinter though on a much smaller scale.  It appears a dozen fireballs were detonated, though no assassination attempts have been noticed.

8) Waterdeep on the other hand, was hit hard. A team of Amnian Simulacra performed a suicide mission and detonated an enchanted item inside the College of Magists, unleashing a massive Cloudkill. The casualties are unknown, but its bad.

9) The Moonwood is burning.  Reports of a Drow assault are coming in, though details are limited.

10) Tethyr, Narfell, and The Efreeti of Calimshan have joined with the Amnians and Thayans and formally declared War on the North.  

The North is reeling under the combined assaults.

The sheer number of Dragons involved has Hugh troubled.  

​Patches pens a quick letter to Lady Fay and gets a quick response. The lady and her ship are alive and in one piece thanks to Lemerlais.  Patches asks to get in contact with Lo'Dan ASAP and if any more information has come out of the Underdark.  The Lady says she will send a message to the Drow and responds saying they have received one more communication from the Underdark that simply says "Stay away".

Tark asks if maybe it could have something to do with Zhengyi and Fey agrees, wondering how the extra-planar nature of their Greater foes factors into this mortal squabble.

Hugh points out that all the attacks make sense save for one: the Drow assault, as it doesn't fit the pattern.  In his view, there's nothing worth destroying or taking in the wood.

Patches perks up at this and studying the map, sighs heavily.  She thinks that the Drow attack was probably personal.  

Patches quotes Corpsetaker, referencing the booming voice heard above the manor; "I will take everything you love, nothing is safe!".  Patches states that she thinks her family have kidnapped her son, who was residing in The Moonwood...
