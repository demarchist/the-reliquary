**The Bluelake District**

Looking around, Patches, Fey, Buumi and Gwen all find themselves separated from the others.

In the nice part of town, they are surrounded by servants, merchants and citizens rushing to and fro, clearly preparing the city for some event.

The group, still getting their bearings, are quickly approached by two guards who noted their sudden appearance.

Clutching their halberds and showing sparkling, clean armor, the guards proceed to question the group.

Fey, not liking their tone, explains the situation (Teleport mishap) and that he is in the city with a member of the Von Bumidere family.

Dropping Buumi's family name and with the teleport circle explained, the guards back off and apologize for the inconvenience.

Quickly figuring out where they are, Buumi tags along with Fey and Patches as they head to the castle so that Fey can get inside and complain about the teleport issues to the Guild.

Upon arriving at the castle, they find it in lock down with the current events, only letting designated people in and out of the castle.

Fey explains to the guards who they are and that the "event" the council of Helm's Hold is because of them and they should be allowed into the castle.

One guard leaves to go an ask while the group stands around making fun of the tiny door in the large gate of the castle called the "Wicket"

Eventually, the guard returns and says that if Fey wishes to lodge a complaint he must return tomorrow.

Exasperated, the group turns to leave, Buumi leading them in the direction of his family estate nearby.

After 15 minutes of walking, the group makes it to a large mansion with sizable gardens in the middle of the Bluelake district.

Approaching the main gate, they see a bustle of activity, with servants and carts coming and going, delivering things for the event.

At the gate are six guards including a vaguely Arabic looking man in leather armor, with two swords on his belt and a large Copper Dragonborn in full plate armor.

The group approaches and the man notices Buumi, calling out and Buumi responds with a resounding "VAL!".

They hug and Buumi introduces "uncle" Val Tengu, the captain of the house guard.

They chat for a minute and Buumi asks for lodging for the group.  Unfortunately, they are told that with the preparations for visiting dignitaries, Val cannot promise them lodging in the main estate without the weigh-in of Esimir, Buumi's father.  Though the group can stay in the guest house for the night.

The group politely refuses and says they will return the next day when the families return from their various activities.

Val promises to let everyone know they are in town and reiterates how good it is to see Buumi (as they thought he was dead for a year).

As the group leaves, they address the Dragonborn out of curiosity, as none of the group have ever seen one before.  She bows to the group and offers them greeting before returning to her post.

She remarks that 200 of her kin now work for Lord Neverember as city guard.  Val remarks that they are VERY good at what they do.

Fey recalls that two decades past there was an event that deposited a large colony of the strange creatures far to the Southeast from another world.  Since then, they have made their way across Faerun as expert mercenaries and exemplars of honor and truthfulness.

The group turns from the manor and try to decide where to go and how to meet up with their scattered companions.

They decide to call for a carriage ride and hop inside.  As they do a small voice greets them and a tiny messenger-cirrus with a box is waiting for them.  Opening the box, they read the letter detailing that Cirrus is in the Rift district, attempting to track the Warlock of Ceregorach in the city and that they should meet him at "Della's General Goods".

The carriage driver knows the store and they set off. 
  

**The Rift**

 Meanwhile, Cirrus finds himself in the rift district, alone.

Sensing the presence of the other Warlock nearby, Cirrus turns and calls to a nearby guard who comes hustling over.

Explaining his predicament, the guards point him in the direction of the nearest guard house, at the transition to the Protector's District, across from the Fallen Tower Inn.

The guards escort the strange tiefling and Cirrus is put off initially by their suspicion. 

After talking with them for a few minutes though, he realizes that its because of a series of murders, murders perpetrated by the other warlock in the city.

With the Council so soon and the murders still unresolved, the local guard are becoming antsy, hiring adventurers to look into it but with no luck.

remembering what the halfling warlock looked like from his vision, Cirrus asks the guards if they have seen anything like "this" and disguises himself as the nasty creature.

The guards are taken aback but remark that they have not seen anything like it; a small, pallid skinned and stringy haired halfling with pale eyes and teeth filed to points.  They say they will circulate the description.

Arriving at the plaza and seeing the guard house, Cirrus approaches it to try and get more information on the warlock.  Crossing the plaza, he feels the presence of the creature strongly.

In the guardhouse, Cirrus sits and talks with Lieutenant Nanling.

After an extensive chat, Cirrus discovers that the most recent victim was Boris Goodsman, husband of Della Goodsman who owns a general store by the rift.  He's also told that another group of adventurers went looking for the killer, the "Red Grin Killer" and never returned.

Thanking him for his time, Cirrus leaves and heads towards the Rift and Della's General goods.  As he goes, he uses a spell to summon a messenger to send to his companions to meet him at the General store and that he has a lead on the Warlock he is tasked to deal with...

**The Red Belt**

 Tark and Gundren look around, finding themselves in a decrepit alleyway and surrounded by shanties.

Looking out into the street, they see a number of stalls and food vendors.

Easily distracted, the two think nothing of their missing friends and move to go and get a bite to eat.

As they approach the end of the alleyway, there's a commotion and a number of youths all appear at the end of the alleyway brandishing makeshift weapons.  They look somewhat startled.

The gang approaches Tark and Gundren, the two of them attempting to diffuse the situation as the youngsters mention that anyone moving through their alley needs to pay the toll.

Not really having a grasp on currency, Tark offers them cash and Gundren quickly grabs the monks hand, pushing it away and refusing to pay with a sneer.

The youngsters look over the two and pause, taking note of the gear.  As they do, a commotion at the other end of the alley reinforces their resolve and they move in closer.

Behind them, another figure moves in, larger and more imposing, the newcomer introduces himself as Billy the Butcher and he pulls out two long knives.

The kids move in to attack Gundren, smashing their weapons down about his head and shoulders, but the makeshift clubs shatter on his fine armor and the Dwarf laughs in their faces.

Billy moves in and quickly cuts at Tark, scoring a hit.

Surprised, Tark retaliates, dropping a globe of Darkness on them just as Gundren greases the alleyway causing the youngsters to all scramble and fall. He turns with his shotgun and unloads on Billy, grazing him.

In the darkness, Tark lays into Billy and with a final kick to the sternum, smashes the huge man halfway through the wooden alley-wall.

Gundren and Tark walk out of the alleyway a moment later none the worse for ware (save a small cut on Tarks forehead).

They approach one of the stalls, the only one with a Dwarf and order Kebabs and Moonshine.

The other Dwarf greets them heartily, laughing that the "Ghoulfangs" were so easily handled by them.

Tark and Gundren ask where they are and quickly find out that they are in the Red Belt, a Refugee slum that gathered over the last year as people were displaced by the Undead Mists.

One of the youngsters stumbles from the alley, wiping grease from his eyes and spots Tark and Gundren.

The two of them sigh at the kid and ask him if everyone is ok.

The kid has a hard time responding but eventually manages to speak up, saying they're "really in it now" after killing Billy.

Distraught, Tark heads back into the alley to check on Billy and sure enough, the huge man is not moving or breathing, his rib-cage collapsed from Tarks last kick.

The Dwarf they were drinking with followed them and laughs, remarking that things are about to get interesting.

Unwilling to simply leave (like Gundren suggests) Tark grabs the body of Billy and ask the strange Dwarf where his family would be.

Tark picks up Billy's necklace of Ghoul Fangs.

He's pointed off deeper into the slum and Tark gets Gundren to help him carry the body as they go off looking for the Goulfangs.

As they head down the streets, people scatter, making way for them and knowing that trouble is brewing.

The streets veritably clear, though a crowd is gathering at the periphery and people look on from makeshift buildings.

Approaching a large intersection, Tark and Gundren see a decently sized bar with a number of mean looking thugs sitting out front, all wearing Ghoul tooth necklaces.

As they approach, the thugs take note and as they see the body of Billy, they jump to their feet, pulling out knives.

Tark brandishes the Goul tooth necklace and remarks that he's sorry but Billy died attacking them.

The other thugs howl and charge.

Gundren, figuring how this was going down, was ready and pulls his thundercannon, blasting two of the thugs into oblivion and seriously hurting the third.

The others rush Tark but as they strike, the monk deftly dodges and counters, snapping wrists and cracking ankles and quickly (and non-lethally) taking the attackers out of the fight.

As the initial wave is dealt with, more rush out from the bar behind, along with a massive man with a tusk-like tooth, clearly a half breed Ogre of some kind.

The second wave appears to be far more capable, many wielding legitimate swords and Gundren is forced on the defensive, pulling his battleaxe from his belt.

Tark is caught and surrounded, facing up against two of the sword wielders and the big guy; Tusker.

Moving gracefully, no one can land a blow on Tark as he counters and feints, landing strike after strike on Tusker and stunning the big fellow.

Meanwhile, Gundren takes as good as he gives, bleeding from numerous cuts but hacking down bandit after bandit that comes to him.

As Gundren pulls his ax from the head of an unlucky bandit, he looks around and sees a crowd of civilians watching...and a couple of bandits that had pushed through the crowd. As the bandits see the scene though, they hesitate, seeing eight of their companions dead on the ground from two enemies.

As they look on, Tark finishes Tusker with a solid strike to the temple and the massive mountain of a man goes down in a heap.

The two sword wielding bandits look at one another and back at a completely unharmed Tark...and bolt.

Tark lets them go and they flee into the crowd of onlookers, who are surging forwards.

With the thugs dealt with, the local populace rushes into the dive bar, Gundren and Tark quickly following.

Inside, the barkeep and any patrons still inside offer no resistance and the civilians rush to a stair leading down into a cellar.

As Tark and Gundren look around, they see prisoners being freed from down below - slaves that the gang had been gathering.

Concerned, the two heroes head down and see a score of cages, the last few of which still have people in them in the midst of being freed by the civilians.

The two are thanked profusely and hailed as heroes and champions.

As they look around the cellar, they spot a makeshift (and terribly made) door.

Opening it, a rough-hewn tunnel with crooked supports can be seen descending into darkness.

Tark convinces Gundren that this will get them into the city and the Dwarf Sighs, not really disagreeing.

They head into the dark, cramped tunnel.

Walking for a good twenty minutes, they eventually get to a stone wall, crumbled in intentionally and leading into the sewers of Neverwinter proper.

Gundren looks at the slurry of shit and refuse and hesitates, unwilling to wade through anything that smells worse than himself.

Tark agrees and they begin looking for a ladder up to the surface, which they find in short order.

Climbing up to street level, they push aside an Iron manhole and climb into the streets of Neverwinter, in the Tower District.

An immaculately clean monk, and a blood covered Dwarf, both in adventuring attire attracts some attention and a guard hustles over.

After a brief exchange, the Monk and Dwarf are free to go and the Guard is off to report a smuggling tunnel that was being used by a gang in the slums.

Not quite sure where to go from here, Tark and Gundren start to talk about it but are interrupted by a high-pitched voice.

Looking around, they see a small Cirrus with a box.  Another messenger spell.  Reading the note contained within, they head out to meet up with the rest of their group.

**Meeting up at Della's**

 Cirrus hurries through the Rift district, tense at the prospect of dealing with the first of Ceregorach's wayward warlocks.

He asks a guard for directions and shortly finds Della's General goods.

As he approaches, a carriage pulls up nearby and Patches, Buumi, Fey and Gwen all disembark.

Fey tells Cirrus why they were seperated, mentioning that Mordenkainen is in the city.

The group then heads to Della's General Goods to inquire about the most recent murder perpetrated by the Red Grin Killer, the warlock of The Tooth Fairy.

The group hangs back as they let Cirrus do most of the talking.

They find out that Boris was killed two nights ago, found by his wife with all his teeth ripped from his skull and missing his lips, like all the other 43 found victims.

The new information they get though is that for days prior, the man awoke in the night screaming from night terrors, vivid dreams of being burned alive.  Della tells them that as a child, Boris escaped a burning building but that fire still haunted him.

Leaving the bereaved woman, Cirrus and the group deliberate outside the store.

Putting the clues together, Cirrus theorizes that there are Meenlocks, servants of Ceregorach, in the area and that the Warlock is using them to terrorize his victims before he strikes.

With this new clue, Fey decides to scry on the warlock, using the image provided by Cirrus to target the spell.

Wanting a stronger link, they check the alleyway that Boris was found in and comb through the area. Fey manages to find a long, stringy hair that matches the Warlocks, a perfect focus for a scry.

Fey casts and his vision is spirited away, speeding through the streets of Neverwinter to a plaza he and the others had recently passed through.  He sees the plaza that houses the Guard post and the gate to the Protector's district and sees The Fallen Tower Inn.  The spell focuses on a small human waif, a street urchin staring from an alleyway across at the Inn.  It takes a moment, but Fey is certain, the human urchin is the warlock in disguise.

With Buumi carrying Fey as he maintains the spell, the group heads off back to the plaza and the Fallen Tower Inn.

**The Fallen Tower Inn**

Approaching the plaza, Fey notes the Urchin is still intent on the inn and breaks the spell.

The group hangs back and Cirrus decides to go in and try and talk with the Warlock, to see if he can sway the murderous little creature from its path of depravity.

As Cirrus moves in, Tark and Gundren reunite with the rest of the group as they move through the area and see Fey hanging back.  Approaching, they ask whats going on and get a quick briefing.

Fey scries on the warlock again and sees the little creature starting to take note and come on alert as it senses something...then, its eyes fix on Cirrus as he strides across the plaza directly toward it.

The little creature looks ready to flee, but stands its ground, sneering at the approaching warlock.

Cirrus makes contact.

Eyeing one another in the alleyway, the two begin to talk.  The creature does not introduce itself, but it seems to know Cirrus, who and what he is, that he sacrificed companions to Marilith in the past and that he betrayed The Tooth Fairy.

Cirrus tries to talk to the thing, but it continues on, uninterested in what Cirrus has to say and arrogantly proclaims that everything Cirrus has done is meaningless, that Ceregorach had a plan, that it's not dead and even now is plotting.

Perturbed, Cirrus tries to talk to the creature but it disappears in a flash of arcane energy.  Cirrus recognizes the spell as Far Step and his respect for his adversary increases, knowing the potency of the spell.

Cirrus returns to the rest of the group and informs them of their chat and that he thinks this warlock of the Tooth Fairy will be a difficult adversary.  Everyone agrees that this monstrous little murderer needs to be dealt with.

With no clues other than The Inn, the group turns to The Fallen Tower and approach the establishment.

Heading inside, they are greeted with a bustling tavern and inn, dozens of patrons sitting at tables, a large bar and a stage with a performer currently singing.

Most of the group stays milling around the entrance, but Cirrus beelines for the stage.

Looking around, Patches notes a number of scratches that she recognizes as Thieves Cant and realizes that this inn is an Establishment.

Cirrus takes the stage, interrupting the handsome, but tired looking Bard and magically enhances his voice.

Addressing the room, Cirrus lays it out, that the killer is stalking someone here, someone recently terrorized by bad dreams and that he is here to hunt the thing doing this.  If anyone is having night terrors, they should meet him at the bar and he then descends the stage and heads to the bar.

The group meets up there and a few minutes later, the Bard from the stage finishes his set and heads straight toward the group.

Sure enough, the Bard himself, a man named Jake, has been having night terrors.  This, coupled with his truly stunning smile and perfect teeth pretty much seals it.

The group convinces the young man that they can help him and they head up to his lodgings in the inn to discuss things further.

Tark remains down at the bar and orders some drinks from the Orc bartender.

After a couple, Tark finds himself with company and looks over to see a middle-aged man leaning against the bar.  The man introduces himself as Galen Marek and asks some questions.  Its apparent that Galen knows more than he's letting on and recognizes the group.  After a short conversation, he leans in and whispers to Tark that he's a spy and is looking for help to secure the city from evildoers.

Intrigued, Tark says he will think it over. Galen goes to leave and Tark very loudly says goodbye to "Ga"...and is grabbed before he can finish the name, ale splashed into his mouth to shut him up.

Galen attempts to slip into the crowd but Tark follows, grabbing onto the mans sleeve.

Galen turns, surprised and looks at the monk with appreciation of his skills.

He says they will talk more soon and bids the monk goodnight.

Tark finishes his drink and heads upstairs to rejoin his friends.

Upstairs, the group has talked with Jake, detailing enough of whats happening to get him to agree to a plan.  They group will wait nearby (and in the room) to keep him safe from the warlock and the Meenlocks that have been terrorizing the poor lad.

The group rents a room right next door and they split up, with half the group waiting in the adjacent room and the others waiting with Jake in case the murderous creature makes its move...
