## The Ascent

The wagon rattled south from Vallaki along the old Svalich road, carrying a weary and battered company. Tark rode atop, meditating. Patches rode her new mount — the war tiger, still unnamed. Gundren, phasing back from wherever Barovia had sent him, immediately began taking inventory of his supplies. At the Ilyich crossroads, two familiar trappers — Szoldar and Yevgeni — emerged from the trees laden with wolf pelts. After some haggling and a mention that the group had killed Gowain, the trappers sold them furs and cold-weather gear before heading back to Vallaki, hundreds of gold richer.

Gundren set to work with his artificing tools, cutting and sewing furs into four additional sets of gear. As the road climbed into the foothills, they found the body of an old man on a steep slope, dying — throat torn, one leg missing below the calf, a crossbow bolt deep in his side. Patches rappelled down to him. He was past saving. He handed her a family signet ring and whispered: *"Urwen... son... give him..."* and something about an heirloom interred with Sergei. Patches pulled the trigger on her crossbow. She took the ring and his magnificent fur cloak, and the group sent Mr. Pickles and Chekhov back to Vallaki with the body.

The wagon pushed higher. Kasimir warned them about the mountain's dangers. Snow deepened, wind howled, and the temperature plummeted. Even through the cold-weather gear, the biting cold sapped their strength. Patches, her Underdark heritage offering no protection against extreme cold, began to shiver uncontrollably. They reached a gatehouse — walls extending up and down the mountainside, a white stone tower beyond, and a wall of green fire crackling in the archway. Fëanon identified the two bird-like statues atop the wall as petrified Vrocks, warded to attack if anyone bypassed the gate. He dispelled the fire and the group passed through on foot.

In the frozen tower beyond, they found a teleportation circle — Fëanon copied the coordinates. Past an old stone bridge and an illusory dark horseman, the snow became too deep for the wagon. They left the tigers in its shelter and continued on foot, blasting and melting a path through drifts. Yetis lurked in ambush ahead — Tark wrapped the group in shadow and they prestidigitated a disturbance down the mountainside, drawing the beasts away. Then the ground shook and a gargantuan armoured worm erupted from the snow — a polar worm, its glittering eyes sweeping the air. Cyrrus conjured a spectral mount and sent it careening down the slope. The beast screeched and gave chase. The group ran.

The facade of the Amber Temple materialised through the swirling snow — fifty feet high, six alcoves holding twenty-foot amber statues of faceless hooded figures in prayer. Between the innermost statues, a staircase descended into darkness. Atop the facade, a titanic black eagle shuffled on its perch — a Roc, its hundred-foot wingspan ruffling in the wind. Tark renewed his stealth magic and they crept to the entrance, choosing a fissure in the rock rather than the front stairs.

## Inside the Temple

Twenty feet through the fissure, Patches found a campfire surrounded by barbarians and a huge white wolf. Fëanon sent a wave of colour and light through the gap, stunning everyone inside. The group rushed in, disarmed and restrained the barbarians, and gathered around the fire while Patches finally shook off the cold.

Fëanon discovered a hidden door to a sealed room containing an ancient scroll rack. Most of the scrolls crumbled at a touch, but three survived: Modify Memory, Catapult, and Greater Restoration. Through the amber-inlaid stone doors, they found a corridor with arrow slits and flickering light behind them. Tark peeked through and spotted three floating flameskulls. Fëanon distracted the constructs with a subtle spell and the group burst through in a devastating ambush — the three skulls shattered in seconds.

The corridor yielded an ancient potion laboratory with a few intact vials, a staircase to the lower level, and — behind the third door — a perfect scale model of Castle Ravenloft, tended by the ghost of its architect. The ghost confirmed the model's accuracy, and the group spent several minutes mapping every floor and committing the layout to memory. In a wooden chest they found a magical Tome of Understanding, which they gave to Tark.

## Stick

Meanwhile, Patches had slipped through the amber doors into the main temple — a vast vaulted space with black marble columns, an amber-glazed ceiling lending the gloom a golden sheen, and a forty-foot statue of a faceless cowled figure, its stone hands outstretched as if casting a spell. She crossed the floor in her piwafwi, invisible to all — until a voice popped into her head.

*"OH! OH! Hello there!"*

Patches froze. Through mental conversation, she learned that someone named "Stick" was hidden in a secret compartment of the great statue, guarded by a powerful fiend — an Arcanaloth. Following Stick's directions, she climbed the statue, found the secret door, and ascended to the head. There sat a large anthropomorphic fox in purple robes and spectacles, perched on a stool and studying a spellbook: Nefron, the Arcanaloth, who had stolen Stick from a battlefield months ago and was trying to attune to him.

Patches' eyes settled on the staff itself — dark hardwood with gold-inlaid filigree, capped with a huge perfect ruby and a gold endcap. She relayed her findings to the group via the communication devices, then silently lifted the staff and crept back down with her treasure.

Fëanon practically salivated. He recognised it immediately: a Staff of the Archmagi. Stick introduced himself properly — he was Mordenkainen's staff and asked to be returned to his master. The group agreed. Fëanon slung Stick over one shoulder.

## The Feast of Ghosts

The group took the staircase between the alchemy lab and the architect's room. Cyrrus, walking ahead impatiently, stepped on a pressure plate at the bottom. A steel spike shot from the wall and impaled him through the side, pinning him to the stone. Gasping, blood oozing, he told Tark where his healing potion was and to use it when he passed out. Tark struck the spear, bending it but not breaking it — the jolt knocked Cyrrus unconscious. Gundren pushed past with a hacksaw and cut through the trap. They pulled the spear free, fed Cyrrus the potion, and watched the wound scab shut.

The lower level was a vast amber-glazed hall with a vaulted ceiling, its walls lined with alabaster statues of wizards' familiars — cats, frogs, hawks, owls, ravens. Many had fallen and shattered.

Before exploring further, the group opened the final doors at the far end of the upper corridor and found a magnificent feast laid on an ancient table, surrounded by twelve chairs — seven occupied by the ghosts of long-dead mages. The ghosts seemed placid, and the group dug in hungrily. They identified a magical silver Ewer at the table's centre that was summoning the food. Gundren grabbed it. The ghosts' calm features twisted into masks of murderous rage and they launched themselves at the group. The psychic assault aged Fëanon twenty years in a heartbeat — his subtle wrinkles deepening — and Tark forty, giving him a streak of grey in his beard and deep laugh lines around his eyes. Gundren slammed the Ewer back on the table and the ghosts calmed. Buumi raised the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind and bathed the room in warm sunlight. The ghosts sagged with relief, smiled wearily, and melted away. Gundren immediately grabbed the Ewer again and tossed it to Fëanon, who deposited it in the bag of holding.
