The group moves in to investigate the well-made tunnels, draggin **Hazzim **with them.

They do not catch up with the fleeing cultist and decide instead, to move in slowly and carefully.

They check a trapped and locked door at the end of the hallway the Cultist fled down and Feanon uses Passwall to simply make the stone door disappear.

Inside is a smoking and reclining Cultist who sits up in bed alarmed.

He does not make any threatening moves and in fact surrenders quite quickly.

The young man looks sickly and his veins pulse with dark corruption.

The group interrogates the man, known as **Raveel** and then call over to Hazzim to see if they know one another.

It turns out they do and are in fact friends.

After some more interrogation, the group decides to trust the story of these cultists - that **Raveel** came first, found steady food and shelter and then sent for his friends to join him.

After the first few days, things went downhill as the true nature of the cult was revealed. 

They still think it was better than surviving on their own, but they also have no loyalty to the Cult and renounce the evil.

Everyone remains suspicious and the group apprehend him, taking his tablets of communication that go higher up in the cult.

**Raveel**, though bound, offers to lead the characters exactly where they want to go - to the Mural of the Word and he leads on.

As the group passes a grand set of sealed doors, Feanon asks what is inside.

**Raveel** knows that it houses monsters and the group decides (after prying the door enough to see inside and seeing many tanks) to move on.

Deeper into the complex, the group enters a massive and ornate chamber.

On one wall is a beautiful mural depicting the Saurians conquering and expanding across the planes.

In the center of the mural is an icon of light and power, a single relic at the heart of their incredible mechanized empire.  The similarities are unmistakable to the ancient mural seen long ago beneath Neverwinter; this appears to be a fragment of The Last Word.

They ask **Raveel** where the Fragment would be.

Expecting the typical answer of “lost to time” they are shocked when he tells them exactly where the artifact is: **At the heart of the black Pyramid, in the dead city of Sharza, **where the Saurians ended the world with their weapon.

As the group investigates the room, they do not notice the Cultist in the shadows.

She steps forward and throws a lever, then flees the chamber.

She is spotted doing this, but vents open and a statue in the middle of the room retracts, a massive metal machine comes from the hole as spiders climb from the vents.

A massive machine of whirling metal and blades battles the group - an ancient Saurian Machina intent on defending the installation.

The thing proves to be a worthy foe and the group takes several wicked hits before putting it down.

As they wreck the security of the room, Gundren scavanges as much enchanted Bronze as he can.

The group then moves to the south, following the flight of the cultist.

They find a ring-teleporter that **Raveel** says will take the group to the Main Ringed Veil, the one to take them to Al’Askar itself.

Before heading on, the group investigates one more lead - **Raveel** tells of a powerful tome used by the Cult.

Intrigued, Feanon wishes to see the book, as does Buumi and Cirrus.

As the group arrives at the area **Raveel** spoke of, vents open and Mechanical beetles swarm forth attacking the group.

They are dealt with quickly, though the dangerous contraptions explode when killed, throwing shrapnel everywhere.

After dealing with security again, the group is wanting to push on but check one last room.

Inside they see several massive raw gemstones and quickly go about looting the contents of the room.

As several return to the teleportation room, Feanon finds the book he’s been looking for at the center of the speaking chamber.

He approaches a relic book made from Volcanic glass, with an oily black iridescent cover.

The slablike tome is clearly dangerously magical.

Feanon attempts to overcome its wards and is left shaking and vomiting.

Buumi rushes to his side and cleanses the corruption from the wizard.

Feanon steels himself and tries again, this time with success.

Feanon pockets the book and the group reunites at the teleporter.

**Raveel** warns that the main Veil chamber is well defended and by now, they would have been alerted and ready for trouble.

Wanting to scout, the group sends Cirrus’ owl through while the warlock sees through its eyes.

It gets one good look at the room before it is pummeled with Fire Staff blasts and destroyed.

The cult is indeed ready, and waiting…
