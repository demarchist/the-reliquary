The Balor surges forward, showering the Deep Gnomes with Acid, causing them to call out in agony.

Patches, Snorbul and Tark assault the great Demon, taking terrible burns but slashing into the creature, cutting it apart.

The great Ooze of the Balor re-knits quickly and lashes out in great pseudopod whips and great slashes.

Another elemental Crumbles and the group takes hits.

More concerning though, the group notices a massive buildup of acid inside the Greater Demon.

Diggermattock Casts a wall of Force across the doorway, blocking the Balor from continuing to shower the area with acid, giving his soldiers relief.

Patches, Gundren and Feanon though are now separated from the inside of the Dome here and need to reposition.

Meanwhile, to the south, Cirrus is engaged with a veritable army of Barlgura’s and a Glabrezu, though is backed up by the Earth Elementals and Druids of Blingdenstone.

The beastial Demons hurtle in, charging in a wall into the Elementals.

Two leap over the line, landing by CIrrus and immediately attacking the Warlock.

The two strange Red Oozes that attacked earlier, retreat inside the Dome and begin disgorging Suflurous Impersonations to attack Cirrus and the Gnomes.

The Battle is fierce and Cirrus looks to be getting bloodied by the two Barlgura, until Feanon and Gundren begin to shoot the Demons in the back, making quick work of them.

The Druids then come in with Banishment spells, removing a few of the Barlgura.

The Glabrezu that was supposed to back up the charging Barlgura is nowhere to be found and the Demons begin calling out curses to the greater Demon for abandoning them..

As the Barlgura had charged, the Glabrezu went to assault with them, but was attacked from behind by the Monk.  As the thing tried to flee, it was slain and Tark then went to assist Snorbul against the Balor, leaving Cirrus to battle the Barlguras.


Separated by the Wall of Force, Patches climbs the walls and squeezes into a tiny window, getting sight on the Balor, she tossed a bomb down onto it, rocking the chamber with a blast.

With the Wall of Force blocking the Balor, the thing teleports itself, appearing outside the Dome and just behind Gundren and Feanon.

The thing appears with a thunderous boom and it disgorges the acid it had pent up, spraying a massive sixty foot cone.

The poor Gnomes are showered, but their hardy stonelike constitution appears to be some defense, though two are dissolved outright and many are burned horribly.

The Gnomes scramble to get away from the monstrout Demon.

The Balor has miscalculated though as all sights turn to it as Patches, Feanon, Cirrus, and Gundren and their Gnomish allies all lay into the Demon Lord which is quickly staggered by the assault.


Patches smiles as her ancient Brass Crossbow bolt lances into the Demon Lord, she pulls another from the ancient wooden case and fits it to her bow.

She spots Feanon below save her companions with a deft counterspell and then respond with a Cone of Cold, catching the strange red oozes and their children in the freezing blast.

A skittering sound catches her off guard and the head of a Chasme Demon snaps into the window, its probiscus lancing for her neck.

She parries, materializing Eclipse and then gashing the Demon across the face.

Wanting nothing to do with the Demon in her face, Patches somersaults from the window, outside to continue the fight against the Balor.

As she hurtles in, slashing, the creature teleports back inside the Dome to renew its assault on Tark and Snorbul.

Meanwhile, Thorna battles a Chasme Demon, supported by Deep Gnome allies she smites the thing with a thunderous retort, smashing the demon to pulp and charges into the Dome.

The Demon Lord in the center of the Dome begins to chuckle, emitting a rumbling basso laugh as it’s surface begins to agitate and undulate, pockets of acid swelling within.

Sulfurous Impersonations continue to harass the druids and Cirrus and with the Balor gone again, Cirrus turns his attention to the Red oozes within the building and summons a sickening radiance to burn them out of their hole.

Not a moment too soon as a wave of oozlings had surged forward to attack the earth elementals.

The radiance erupts and burns many of them away and begins to eat at the survivors.

A strange wailing erupts from within the dome and Cirrus watches as the things flee, pushing through cracks in the Dome.

As they flee, he notes two objects are pushed from them and become wedged in the cracks.


Diggermattock releases the Wall of Force and his troops surge inside to take up firing positions with crossbows and flank the Demon Lord with the Heroes.

The battle is fierce and acid showers down and the Demon lashes out with whiplike tendrils, striking Tark and Snorbul.

The Balor Vanishes, pulled in on itself in a flash of voidish purple light.

Feanon immediately feels a strengthening in the Planar walls as such a massive Demon is banished.

Standing to the side, Cirrus holds an Iron fork in his hand, extended as if stabbing forward.

The Warlock breathes a sigh of relief and then turns to the group triumphantly condescending...and is immediately piled on by three pissed off Chasme Demons.

They pull him to the ground, piercing him with their proboscis and draining blood by the liter.

Cirrus goes down screaming.

His body erupts with radiant light. 

one of the Chasme demons disintegrates to ash as Cirrus rises from the ground in a burst of blinding light.

He immediately Eldritch blasts the two remaining demons as Patches headshots one with her enchanted bolt.

They die gruesomely, blasted apart.

Cirrus stops glowing and drops to the ground, groaning in pain and staggering.

The gnomes rush to support him as their troops and the rest of the group pours into the building, slaying all the remaining Demons and Oozes.

The magic and potions begin to flow as the winners take stock of the injuries and casualties.

They did shockingly well, with few dead but many many wounded.  Wounded that can be healed thanks to the cleansing of the temple to the south, the Divine conduit allowing greater healing from the Gnomes. 

Due to the majority of the Oozes having left for the north for some unknown reason, that and the absolute power of the group was beyond what the Demons could have reasonably expected to be backing up the Gnomes.

The jovial mood of victory is broken as the temperature of the chamber rapidly drops and a great shadow rises from the tunnel at the center of the Dome.

Patches calls out that below in the chamber is Juiblex, the Demon Lord.

A manifestation of the power of Juiblex addresses the chamber, cursing them for their foolishness in not allying with him against Zuggtomy, their common enemy.  In particular, he lashes out at Patches for her betrayal and foolishness, throwing abyssal energy at her in an attempt to curse her.

Feanon is having none of it and Counterspells the curse, shattering the building Weave.

The shadow of Juiblex’s will slinks away, retreating with its children to the North, to fight Zuggtmoy.

The Demon Lord has fled.  Blingdenstone is truly saved.

The Gnome priests and druids expend all their healing spells and caravans begin to be put together to ferry the wounded back to Blingdenstone proper.

With the oozes gone, the ghosts gone and the wild elementals gone, Blingdenstone is safe again.

The Gnomes express their thanks and promise trade negotiations with Selunia as soon as everyone is rested, they are eager to make a formal alliance with the Barony.

Feanon has a thought and wants to inspect the remains of the Oblex Oozes.  He asks Cirrus where he last saw them and is pointed toward the cracks in the Dome.

Investigating, Feanon finds two ancient books wedged in the cracks, clearly of Gnomish origin and specially varnished and sealed, the books survived within the Oblex’s empowering them.

With a grin, Feanon consults the Iron Tome, Theodemir and then breaks the wards on the book with a deft hand. Inside he finds a treasure trove of arcane knowledge, shockingly not written in code and easy to decipher.

The group decides to set up and rest and they summon the Magnificent Mansion, inviting any Gnomes that wish to enter and partake in the pleasantries within.

The Gnomes leave after a few hours and the group settles in to rest, addressing their grievous wounds and simply resting through the night.

Several hours later, the group stirs and head out into the now almost deserted Dome.

They see Gurnik, the Deep Gnome High Priest nearby with an elemental and he nods at them and then gestures toward the tunnel down, descending in the center of the room.

Patches takes the lead and the group heads down the natural corridor to the Gnomes most holy site; Entemoch’s Boon.

The natural chamber of rough stone shimmers with mineral deposits and it’s stepped sides create a natural amphitheater.

At it’s bottom is a stone altar of solid stone, grown from the natural stone floor.

Atop it are two items.

The group moves in, cautiously with Tark and Patches in the lead.  There’s no sign of demons or oozes, or anything actually.

The place is unusually scoured clean, the rock having been eaten away at over time by the caustic ooze-lord.

The damage it had done to the place seems to be superficial as many in the group can clearly feel the closeness of this place to the Plane of Earth.

They approach the altar of stone and see the items atop it.

One is a half of the Crystal the group seeks; the key to Gravenhollow.

Snorbul picks it up and with assistance, places the cracked ends together, they seal with a soft glow and the crystal shimmers with an inner energy.

Feanon feels the magic emanating from it and takes the time to Identify it as a Stonespeaker Crystal from Gravenhollow.

The other item, Patches inspects and sees a lump of rock.

Handing it over to Feanon, he identifies the magic as Geomancy, focused into Gantlets and Greaves of stone when attuned to.  The artifact is old, and has a subtle identity to it; Umber’s Hands of Stone.

The group looks to Snorbul as, still looking and grinning at the fixed Stonespeaker Crystal, his eyes track to the rock and his eyes light up at Feanons description.
