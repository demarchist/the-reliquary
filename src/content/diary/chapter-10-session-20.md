The group deals with the immediate aftermath of the debutante ball.

Cirrus has secluded himself in his tower

Feanon watches the barony from his scrying chamber and watches Mordenkainen with interest.

Tark and Patches visit Mordenkainen (who ends up helping Tark with his snail) as Patches seeks to further network with the Archmage.

Gundren goes over the reports from the south and begins planning an expedition

Buumi and Doc get to healing folks hurt in the ball the night before.

Patches ends up spying on Willow Aldencroft and visits Buumi in the keep

She tells Buumi that she thinks the woman (Willow) is suspicious.

Buumi agrees and is a bit relieved that his potential betrothed might just be an assassin trying to get at him.

A situation much easier to resolve than a relationship.

The group retires for the night, with Tark saying hello to the followers of Sune (escorts and priestess Miranda) working in Patches establishment.

The group gathers once the guests all leave and they discuss what they want to do next.

Gundren presents his planned expedition to Scornubel and hunting some Efreeti there.

He informs the group that a Dwarven Captain on the front lines has apparently put out a call for experts to deal with the Efreeti his troops are facing.

Gundren presents his plan that they should be those experts.

The group agrees.

As they head out from the Establishment to prepare for the journey, Patches notes a disturbance on the horizon in the Evermoor.

The group turns to inspect the horizon and see a great number of birds having been disturbed.

Bohd, the Mercenary captain scouts the moor atop his Wyvern but sees nothing.

They summon the Mountain Giant Bolg and send him and scouts into the Evermoor to investigate the disturbance.

The group summons their troops and they head south, setting up a defensive line along the moor, expecting an attack from an army pushing up through the swamp.

Nothing comes out of the moor to attack, but Bolg and his men do not return.

Fearing the worst, the group decide to go into the moor to look for their people.

They head in.


The group uses spells and magical means to avoid having to hike through the boggy swamp and make good time, outpacing their defensive troops back at the Barony by many miles.

Eventually, they find signs of a battle.

Some great conflict that has left trees smashed.

Searching the area, they find the corpse of Bolg the Mountain Giant, but determine that he is slowly healing from a ring of regeneration.

They begin to inspect the area further and try and figure out a way to move Bolg to safety.

Expecting an attack from *something* Patches puts herself in harms way, goading an attack and preparing to dodge

As she scans the area, she spots something under the water and accidentally locks eyes with a massive cat-like eye.

An Ancient Black Dragon leaps from the waters to attack Patches as another smaller Black Dragon erupts from another deep pool of water.

The group is attacked by two Black dragons and an Oni that materializes from mist.

The Dragons hit the group hard, spewing lines of acid and smashing through trees with tooth and claw, snapping tree limbs with their flapping wings.

Tark rushes in to attack the dragons while Gundren begins to fire from on high atop Arkto.

The spellcasters, back investigating the other battlesite rush to help their friends.

The great beasts leap into the sky, smashing through the tree canopy with ease as the retaliation from the group is swift and harsh.

Patches hits the Ancient Dragon with her bolt of Dragonslaying, causing a painful wound to the beast that announced it’s name as **Ancalagon the Void, (who was seeking Mordenkainen)**.

The dragons reel from the counterstrike and think better of a drawn out conflict.

The smaller dragon flees and plunges into the waters of the Evermoor and does not reappear, while the Ancient Dragon - **Ancalagon, **roars in anger and flees to the south, soaring over the treetops of the Evermoor.

The Oni is killed quickly by Feanon and Cirrus, though they suspect a second is in the area but laying low.

Shocked and wounded from the short, but intense battle, the group takes stock of their situation in the Moor.

The group quickly retreats to Bolg’s corpse, hearing other creatures off in the distance being drawn to the commotion  

The roars of Trolls are easily heard - and the group teleports themselves and Bolg, back to Feanon’s tower...
