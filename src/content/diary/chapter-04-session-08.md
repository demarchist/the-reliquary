The Nixie freed from the crystal prison attacks group and mind controls the boars.  Buumi grabs the wagon nearby and moves it to block one of the giant Boars.  Blocked and unwilling to break it's cart, the Boars charge the long way around and knock Fey off his feet.  In a flash of insight, Cyrrus banishes the Nixie from the plane and suddenly, the boars are freed. Investigating the area, the group harvests a massive gemstone and finds some gold, as well as a passageway to an area overgrown with crystals thrumming with celestial power.   The group feels safe there and decides to take a long rest, recuperating from their fights. 

Investigating the area, the group finds another of the small faeries in a bottle and Doc B. finds a pouch in a pond containing a valuable ruby.  The group heads onwards into the labyrinth and come to a small stream running down a shallow channel, a large gnarled tree at one end.  Far away from the tree, almost lost in the bog mist, the group sees a moving figure.  The group moves closer and sees that it is JmJm in chains!

As this is happening, a cyclone of crows forms overhead and begin to fly to the tree, merging together into the Goblin King,  the Goblin king won't let JmJm free until he has control and summons minions to attack the group.  Buumi, Zhink and Cyrrus go about freeing JmJm, breaking the chains.  As he is freed, a cat on a nearby wall morphs into his Harp and he strikes up a tune.

The group quickly finds themselves beset by goblins. Fey is quickly surrounded and he is forced to activate many of his defensive magics.  Doc B. calls down a burning moonbeam on the goblins, hurting the king and burning many goblins to ash.  Buumi strikes the King with heavy blows and Zhink Faerie Fires the group, preventing their use of stealth. 

The Goblin king takes a number of wicked blows and is forced to retreat to cover, summoning more minions.  As more goblins run to aid their king, the gnarled tree begins to move, sending branch-like tendrils to assault the party.
