The fairy freed from the crystal was no grateful captive. The Nixie attacked immediately, seizing control of the giant boars' minds and turning them against the group. Buumi grabbed the nearby wagon and shoved it into one boar's path — unwilling to damage its own cart, the creature was forced to charge the long way around and bowled Fëanon off his feet. Cyrrus, thinking fast, banished the Nixie from the plane entirely. The boars were freed.

## The Crystal Grove

Exploring the area, the group harvested a massive gemstone and found gold, along with a passageway to a chamber overgrown with crystals thrumming with celestial power. For the first time since entering the Bog, they felt safe. They rested there, recuperating from days of running battles. Doctor Breakfast found a pouch in a pond containing a valuable ruby, and another of the small fairy creatures in a bottle.

## Finding JmJm

Pressing deeper into the labyrinth, the group came to a shallow stream running alongside a large gnarled tree. Far off in the bog mist, almost invisible, a figure moved. They crept closer and saw JmJm — in chains.

A cyclone of crows formed overhead, spiralling toward the tree and merging into a single figure: the Goblin King, perched in the branches and grinning. He would not release JmJm willingly. With a gesture, goblin minions swarmed from every direction.

Buumi, Zhink, and Cyrrus charged straight for JmJm while the rest held the line. They smashed his chains apart, and the moment JmJm was free, a cat sitting on a nearby wall morphed into his harp. He caught it and struck up a tune.

## The Battle Begins

Goblins poured in from the mist. Fëanon was surrounded quickly and forced to activate every defensive spell he had. Doctor Breakfast called down a moonbeam that burned through goblin ranks and seared the Goblin King himself. Buumi hammered the King with heavy blows. Zhink cast faerie fire on the goblin forces, lighting them up and stripping away their stealth.

The Goblin King, battered by the onslaught, retreated into cover and summoned reinforcements. More goblins poured in — and behind them, the gnarled tree groaned to life, sending branch-like tendrils lashing into the party.
