The battle against the Balors and Marilith rages with JmJm, Patches, Steeden and Cirrus in his angelic form surrounding the great serpentine Demon and her dervish of blades.

The group surrounds and assaults The invisible, levitating Marilith

The combat rages back and forth with the group hitting the demon but being struck repeatedly in turn.

Marilith attempts a disintegrate on Tark but is counterspelled by Feanon

Peeking out of the Saddlebags of Steeden, Doc B takes note of the fray and times his entrance perfectly.

With a leap and a stretch Doc unleashes a powerful spell, the ground beneath the Marilith explodes in a shower of stone and earth

The six armed fiend reacts by teleporting far above the battlefield, unleashes a blistering void-light attack that burns the whole hilltop below her and then falls back into melee with a flurry of blades

meanwhile, Feanon shields himself in an Ice dome from the relentless assault of a Balor and psuhes it back into the waiting Glaive of Patches ancestor

The other Balor is tag-teamed by Buumi and Tark and as they lay into the great Demon, cracks of fire spread across its body

The Illithid, Euphoria blasts the demons with psionic energies before retreating to a safer distance

The cracking Balor reaches out and entangles Tark in her serpentine tentacles and pulls him in close as the cracks then rupture and explode…

Buumi brings his shield up just in time to survive the blast, but he is thrown to the ground smoldering and screaming as he is badly burned

Tark managed to wriggle out of the Balor’s grasp just in time and dive into a crack in the earth (from Doc’s spell), avoiding the blast entirely

The other Balor, bears down on The ancient Drow woman but gets rapidly shot in the back of the head 3 times by Gundren

The Balor spins and vanishes, teleporting behind the Dwarf and assaulting him viciously

The Dwarf adjusts his tactics and pulls out his new Scepter of Lordly might.  One of its many gemstones shines with light and a glowing ax head materializes as he strikes at the Demon, embedding the blade in its side and starting a web of cracks

Patches then darts out of cover, Revolver cracking as she shoots the Balor repeatedly, throwing sparks and smoke before darting back into cover and chugging some potions and then doing it again to Marilith

JmJm sees Gundren battling alone against the Balor and pulls out a mysterious glove from his past! The Arcane Hand slams down and grasps the demon.

The Marilith is unable to steal enough blood with her swords to heal through the damage being dealt and teleports away as far as she can and then calls out an Abyssal spell of terrible power, Healing considerably (wish spell)

With the Marilith temporarily retreating for a breath, the last Balor is struck repeatedly and the glowing cracks grow.

Everyone backs off, save Gundren who pulls out a cigar and then decapitates the demon with a blow from his powerful new weapon.

The Balor explodes in a fireball, Gundren lets the flames wash over him, lighting the Cigar

The group turns all their attention to The Marilith as it re-engages in a flurry of blades and spellcasting and it once again attempts to disintegrate someone, but is shut down.

It cuts at the wizard in revenge

Cirrus rushes over and his healing touch reinvigorates Feanon just as his vision was beginning to blur from blood loss and the Planetar flies back in to tank the Demon’s whirling blades

Doc B desperately casts healing spell after healing spell, closing wounds as quickly as the Marilith can cause them

Gundren then notes a Drow woman floating above the battlefield, hard to spot against the dark starry sky

She summons two Spidery Glabrezu demons  and keeps on the edge of the battlefield, watching. Until Gundren shoots her from the sky and sends Gwen to assault the fallen woman

Gwen pounces, but with a wave of her hand, the Drow Matron banishes Gwen from the vision and heals her wounds

She shouts in defiance “Mother! Apostate! You and these Strangers *cannot *defeat Lolth!”

She is addressing Patches’ ancient ancestor 

The glowing cleric shouts back to the Matron “You and your sisters are lost! Aura Shu Nae has lost her way, she will cast you aside the moment you are no longer useful! The Goddess we knew is gone!”

The fight rages and the group quickly engages the Glabrezu with the Illithid mind controlling one of them just as the other muddles Tark’s mind.

Marilith is looking terribly wounded 

Patches ancestor rushes in to melee, leaping off Buumi in a flip and cuts off one of Marilith’s spellcasting arms at the elbow

As the great snake demon rears back in agony, Feanon points a finger and a green ray darts out, striking Marilith

She screams an agonized wail and cringes away from the powerful spell as she is disintegrated to dust…

The Drow Matron screams in anger and then Dimension Door’s to safety as Tark shadowsteps to assault her and the group lose sight of her

The two remaining Glabrezu are rapidly dispatched

The Drow Arcanist finishes teleporting the fleeing refugees and watches from within the dome, wide eyed and grinning to see his love survive the fight


A perfect stillness falls over the battlefield and time stops

they all feel a celestial presence

Crisserei, the Planetar of Selune appears and mentions that this went very different in the past and touches Patches ancestor on the shoulder

The ancient woman begins moving again and becomes more *aware *of the party and their anachronistic presence

She smiles and thanks the group for changing the dream.  She has always lost this fight until now.

She introduces herself as Matron Mother Kallista Alamreth Undonwe, follower of Elistraee and Selune and apostate of Lolth.

She shows the group how it really happened historically and the battle rewinds to the moment before Patches materialized.

Kallista stands alone.

She fights valiantly, dodging masterfully and counterattacks the Balors, but when the Invisible Marilith assaults she is overwhelmed.

The Drow Matron floats in the sky, gloating down at her embattled mother

Kallista, slowed by burns and cuts and surrounded by monstrously powerful demons, is grappled by both Balors and pulled apart as the Marilith stabs her from behind with all four swords, but with her dying scream, she turns it into a vengeful prayer and calls for Divine Intervention

Her body pulls back together and then keeps going, collapsing into a glowing white light and forming an orb of power which then detonates in a blinding flash

As the group’s eyesight returns, Kallista is nowhere to be seen except for a single glowing Moonstone on the hilltop, just outside the now empty Dome of Force and Monoliths

Her people are safe and the Dome of Force vanishes

A blast pattern of flowering moon lilies now covers the crest of the hill

The Drow Matron mother screams in agony, clutching her burned out eyes.

The Matron flees, leaving the hilltop serene and empty, covered in white flowers around the elven standing stones.  No sign of the battle remains save the glowing gem.

Crisserei smiles and rests a hand on Kallista’s shoulder, comforting the woman for reliving the traumatic memory.

The Planetar then says Kallista’s Lolth worshiping daughter was slain by her sisters days later for being unable to cure her blindness - clearly showing disfavor from lolth

The resulting inter-house civil war left house Alamreth all but destroyed, with a single daughter forging a new house from a band of survivors, the house that would become House Faen Tlabbar.  Patches’ House.

Time in the vision then speeds up, showing several hours of the night pass.

The group watches the grasslands ripple and sway in the sped up night breeze

The group looks confused but the Planetar asks for patience

Then, a movement in the sky catches their attention and a prismatic reflection washes over the hilltop

A huge Crystal Dragon flies in, curiosity peaked by the flash of the explosion from Kallista’s last stand, seen for many leagues.

The reflected light catching the scales stirs a feeling of longing in Tark, of childhood nostalgia before his waking memory

The great dragon lands in a cascade of reflected moonlight and then shifts down into a small humanoid form.

The halfling man bends down and plucks up the glowing Moonstone, looking around as if for the owner of a dropped trinket.

Confusion clearly wrought over the halfling’s face, he wanders the hilltop, examining the battlefield to discern its secrets.

Some time later, the great wyrm shifts back into draconic form and flies off into the darkness of pre-dawn…


The vision ends and the party finds themselves back in the Cathedral of Twilight facing the great Onyx Mirror of Loss.

Reflected in its still blackness is Kallista, who watches her kin with interest

She asks why she was sought out and Patches says she seeks a blessing to break from Faen Tlabbar and start her own house devoid of Lolth.

Kallista offers to bless Patches; Aliyah and bestow upon her the title of Matron for their ancient and long defunct house - Alamreth Undonwe.  The House of Starry Twilight.

Invigorated by the battle and meeting her family in this modern age, Kallista says she will awaken and rejoin her people in Dokkar, if her Great Daughter will wait but a moment.

As the group awaits Kallista, Gundren talks to a nearby cleric attending this spectacle and asks if he may use a mirror to look in on the ancient Bowcrafter he heard about in Dokkar.

The clerics nod and gesture to an empty mirror.  They say that he can only watch, and then only if the dreamer allows it.

Gundren touches the Mirror and finds his vision transported.


Gundren sees an ancient Dark Elf workshop, the place gleaming with magical light reflecting off richly colored marble as a Drow woman inspects her most recent handiwork

Gundren watches, inspecting her at work as the dreamscape changes with the passing of time and watching her work with bone and tendon of very similar materials to what he has.

He watches her shape, carve, bend, lacquer, layer, filigree and infuse the bone with further rare materials to get the shapes and strengths she needs for her epic craft.

Materials that The Foundry has.

Confident that he has gleaned considerable knowledge from the vision, Gundren whispers a silent thanks to the Dreamer and ends the vision.

He rejoins the group


While Gundren was gleaning ancient and lost knowledge from the slumbering dead, the others lean over the pit to the Necropolis of Yggward and the Shadowfell and watch as a gleaming soul begins to walk out of the sprawl of ancient elven mausoleums, growing brighter with each step.

The ghost darts and flickers, teleporting closer between graceful strides 

She then walks up the sheer wall of the Yggward tunnel and into the Cathedral proper.

The soul of Kallista joins the group in person and once again thanks them for their assistance and in awakening her to meet her kin

She turns to Patches and rests two lilac-skinned hands on her Great Daughter’s shoulders and her fiery orange eyes match Patches’

She begins the blessing as promised

Cirrus steps forward with divine providence to oversee the Ceremony, blessing it in the name of Selune

Clerics of the Twin Goddesses assemble but remain a respectful distance away, watching with quiet intent.

Crisserei the Planetar stands nearby, watching and smiling, bathing the area in a radiant glow…save her too dark, cold shadow.

JmJm looks around at the unfolding Ceremony and thinks the audience lacking and expresses a desire for more pizazz, class and *nobility *but is quickly shushed by Buumi to the grumbling of JmJm.

Steeden agrees though; the company *is sorely lacking. *

The Planetar scowls at the Nightmare, clearing sensing its disdain. 

Cirrus places his hands on both Kallista and Patches, eliciting side-eye from both, but the Ceremony is quiet and serene

Kallista names Aliya, now of House Alamreth Undonwe, the new Matron Mother

There is a pulse of Divine power and Patches finds herself infused with *authority; s*he has a Divine Mandate and there is power there, backed by Elistraee herself and the Pantheon of the Moon.

Kallista asks if any more of her family are in Dokkar and Patches names her brother; Finn.

Kallista says she will head to the city to spend time with him and see what time has wrought in the wider Plane.

Crisserei steps forward, interrupting with a polite bow

She informs Cirrus that he is needed at his Place of Power.  It is threatened and the threat is imminent and she wishes to provide a window for the group.

Alarmed that his upcoming festival may be disrupted, Cirrus quickly gathers the party and with a blessing from the Planetar, Plane Shift back home…


They arrive in the Fane, all save the Illithid who appears in one of Feanon’s containment tanks, safe (for now)

The group quickly takes stock.  They are exhausted but the Barony has no alarms or signs of issue.

Cirrus goes to the top of his Fane and gazes across the moonlit landscape of the barony

Light gleams off lake Selunia, illuminating the sheer sides of Feanon’s tower

Cirrus scowls at it and his gaze moves past, to the Moonwood

Uneasy, he returns to the group and urges Feanon to Scry the Barony

The Wizard reaches out to his Tower’s complex wards and activates them, seeing through a network of magical sensors.

North, East and West seem very calm

Movement in the Evermoors catches his attention, but it is too far from the Barony for anything mo(o)re than that

Feanon becomes uneasy as he realizes that something else was not quite right…his attention turns back to the North, to the Moonwood and its absolute silence.

It’s quiet…too quiet.  Not a single creature can be heard

Feanon reports this to the group.  It is calm for now

They decide they must rest and prepare and split to their different abodes to prepare for whatever this *imminent *danger may be…

JmJm rushes back to his theater and pipes up his Grand Organ, beginning a powerful Waltz, with the list of names written on his Casting Call.

Patches slips back to her Sanctum and begins to pray to her goddess

Buumi heads to rally the Paladins

Gundren cannot rest, he *must* craft his new masterpiece. The Passengers demand it.

Cirrus prays, yodeling across the calm barony

Doc heads back to his Grove and after some time, JmJm stalks from the darkness and talks with his friend about the mysterious threat

Doc entreats with some animals and gathers a great host of woodland creatures including a small herd of Deer.  Doc asks them what they know.

The animals are uneasy, many have left the southern tip of the Moonwood in the last few days

None venture into the Evermoor

Doc asks why they left the Moonwood and they reply that they are fleeing “The bad rock that grows”...
