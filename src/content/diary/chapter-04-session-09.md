A Huge branch from the animated tree wraps around Buumi, slamming him into the ground.  As this happens, Tark and Gundren both revert to their normal states from being worms and immediately join in the fray.  Zhink begins to pick off Goblins one by one, Tark attacks others and Gundren and Gwen begin to take down the fodder as well.

Cyrrus, still in his ape form, smashes the Goblin King, who explodes.  One of the large nearby crystals shatters, but the goblin king is quickly reborn as a huge Goblin-Drider. He summons more of the spider-goblin-centaurs to him.  Fey Anon throws another fireball, immolating much of the group and dealing a great deal of damage.  Buumi finally manages to burst free from the root and Doc. B sends out a massive healing wave, rejuvenating the group.

After killing one of the Goblins, Tark hears some bells and investigates, discovering another of the tiny faerie folk.

Buumi and Zhink rush another group of Goblins (zhink having misty stepped out of trouble), while Cyrrus climbs the animated tree to smash it to splinters.  Fey anon hastes Gundren and the dwarf proceeds to unleash hell upon the Treant, blasting it to splinters with numerous shots as Cyrrus rips into it himself.

With the Treant dead and many of the Goblin fodder down, the group beings to re-organize.  The Driders that had gone invisible reappear, attacking Tark, Fey and Gwen.  Tark however uses his shadowstep to get out of trouble and deliver a devastating jumping blow to the Goblin king.  The Goblin king, looking injured but not done, charms Tark and sends him after his friends.  Doc B. directs her moonbeam onto the Goblin King and once again he is reverted back to his normal Goblin form.

Zhink, Cyrrus and Buumi all head from the rear battle towards the main combat, ready to come to the aid of their friends and free Tark from the influence of the Goblin King.
