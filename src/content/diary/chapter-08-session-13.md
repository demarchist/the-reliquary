**Mummies and Locks**

The mummy rises from the sarcophagus, ornately wrapped and covered in riches...and wielding a large, ornate axe.

The mummy brethlessley rasps out in ancient Netherese that it "needs to feed".

Tark agrees that he could eat too, and leaps in to engage the creature.

Tark strikes the creature and it lets out a horrible shriek, the dark energy stunning Cirrus and it retaliates against Tark, slamming him with a wrapped fist.

Tark is staggered from the powerful blow, a bloody welt rising almost instantly.  Worse though, Tark feels an insidious energy take hold of him, sapping his strength.

Gundren follows up with some point blank shots and is retaliated against as well, hit just as hard as Tark.

As the mummy moves, Patches drops Darkness over the back half of the chamber and rushes into the Darkness.

As the Drow goes, the shadows of the room come to answer their master's call, shades rising to attack.

The shadows rush in at Patches and Fey, but are unable to get through their defenses, one of the shadows being confused by Fey and striking its friend.

Firebolts, fists and shots hit the Mummy and it howls in anger, millions of biting insects erupting from all the gaps in its linen wrappings and filling the chamber with the biting things.

As the two sides exchange blows, the Shadows are quickly killed and the mummy is taking heavy damage, the ornate wrappings burning from repeated strikes.

Shaking off the stun, Cirrus takes his staff in two hands and strikes the creature a mighty blow, tearing the wrappings from its face and revealing a long dead visage.

Tark silences the room, noting the dangerous shrieks of the creature.

The creature erupts into a mass of swirling sands, blinding everyone and then fleeing the chamber, the dust and sand slipping through the cracks of the spinning wall section used to enter the hidden chamber.

Fey turns and clicks the switch, rotating the wall section and seeing the Mummy stumbling down the hall, trying to leave.  He drops a fireball on the creature, the conflagration blackening and cracking some of the stone.

The Mummy roars, engulfed in fire, though it dissipates quickly.  The enraged creature turns and casts Hold Person on the wizard, paralyzing him in place.

The mummy hesitates, seeing a victim it could easily feed on.

Too late though, the wall spins, taking the wizard away and leaving Gundren in his place, cannon ignited.  Three shots later and the mummy's arm has been blown off, bits scattered.

It rushes away, fleeing into the darkness of the crypt.

Tark spins the wall himself, rushing in pursuit.  He sees it heading down the hallway the group has yet to check and shadowsteps to it, punching it square in the chest, the dessicated corpse exploding into pieces.

The last words Tark hears from the creature, in ancient Netherese, is "I just want to liiiiiive...."

Gunren walks over and begins rifling through the remains, Patches showing up moments later and the two of them strip it clean of any valuables.

Fey confirms the creature destroyed and then returns to the sarcophagus room with Cirrus, intent on looking it over for riches.

The two of them investigate the room, Gundren showing up a little while later.  Between them, they loot the invisible chest, taking the three items within: A human heart encased in an egg of amber and gold, a Philter of Love and a Lantern of Revealing (promptly affixed to the top of Fey's staff).

Gundren strips the sarcophagus interior of its gold lining and the group heads out to investigate the tunnel the Mummy was heading down.

Finding a large set of double doors, ancient, the copper coating long since oxidized to green, and open them.

They find a large, plain chamber filled with pottery and simple offerings, a massive stone sarcophagus in the center.

Wary, the group fans out to investigate, suspecting foul play.

Sure enough, the sarcophagus is actually a resting Stone Golem.  The group backs off, wondering if they could somehow take control of the inactive Golem.

Not seeing any control tablets, Fey picks up a stone from the tomb, so he can easily return later.

The group heads out of the tomb and to the secured rope and begin to descend back to the boat, Hemeth, Doc, Snorbul and JmJm.

They make it to the ground easily and ask if they missed anything.

Hemeth mentions the bard killed a Bullywug, a nasty frog-creature but other than that it was pretty relaxing.  The Duergar asks for his cut of the take above and the lump of gold pried from the sarcophagus is dumped at his feet aboard the ship.

Hemeth's eyes light up and he takes the gold down to his chambers to be locked away.

Tark and Gundren are still both feeling terrible from the Mummy curse and Cirrus has Gundren crush a beautiful diamond for the dust for the spell.

The curses lifted via Greater Restoration, the boat steams away from the tomb and the rock column, into the darkness of the lake.

The group takes a short rest, taking turns on lookout for Hemeth and they have an uneventful journey to the first of the Duergar Locks.

While underway, the group disguises Gundren to look like a Duergar per Hemeth's suggestion.

Though he has not been openly hostile, Hemeth has made numerous remarks about the "blood traitor" and the group knows bringing a surface Dwarf into a Duergar stronghold might cause some issues...

The boat coasts to a standstill by a large rock wall.

Patches can feel eyes on them but cannot see the fortifications she knows are in the wall.

Hemeth has the group flash a signal with a small hooded lantern (despite Tark messing up a few times) and with a groaning creak, the rock wall begins to part and swing outwards, revealing a carven canal directly into the stone.

Hemeth brings the ship into the water channel.

A few minutes of sailing straight and the ship exits the snug tunnel out into a larger carved chamber - the Lock.

The group looks from the deck at the Duergar engineering, a massive chamber carved from the stone, creating a large pool of water large enough for several ships.

Fortifications line the inside of the chamber, floor to ceiling "towers" at each corner of the very square chamber.

The far wall, where docks have been constructed, shows numerous windows and features, a fort built into the walls of the stone here.

Diagonally opposite from the entrance to this hidden fortress is a large metal gate, floor to ceiling.  Hemeth points it out as the water-elevator.

The boat trundles into port and Hemeth throws the dock hands the lines to secure the ship.

With the ship secure, the group disembarks and head into the common area pointed out by Hemeth while he logs the ship with the Dockmaster.

The group enter the fort common room through a large set of open doors, a crackling hearth inviting them inside.

Taking a seat the group orders a massive meal of Rothe Stew, Crab dumplings and wash it down with Darklake Stout.

Haggling with the Duergar running the common room, a few good trades are made - the group picking up 2 kegs of Darklake Stout and eleven bottles of Drow Wine (Patches sampling one to make sure its good).

Hemeth joins them not long after and digs in himself, the group having ordered a truly impressive amount of food.

Turns out that business has been slow recently with fewer boats and minor demon attacks.  Last week a Drow passing through tried to knife someone for no apparent reason and was dealt with.

Seeing the Duergar Locks as a potential safe spot, they mull over spending the night, but decide to press on instead, the Lock being ready within the hour.

The group finish their meal (Tark having significantly over paid) and head back to the ship, paying the tariff and dropping a few copper into the collection slot of the common room.

Before long, the metal gates of the Lock creak open and Hemeth pulls the ship in, the gates closing behind and sealing the ship in absolute darkness.

With their Darkvision, the group sees the blank stone walls of the Lock begin to move as the water level in the chamber begins to drop.  

Minutes of descent turn into over an hour, the ship dropping hundreds of feet until finally, another metal gate resolves itself from the dropping water level.

When the water level stops changing, the great gates groan open, revealing an identical fortress (also devoid of ships).

Not wanting to tarry, Hemeth takes the ship out of the Locks and back onto the Darklake.

Heading out from the Duergar fortifications, the group enters a watery chamber far different from the one above.

Where the cave holding Sloodublop was massive, vaulted, beyond sight, this new section of the waterways is cramped and claustrophobic, the ceiling sometimes coming so low that the top of the ship scrapes the stone.

The party knows the drill and for the next few hours maintain an effective lookout.

Working in shifts the group begin to take a long rest, but eventually moor the boat by a large, but squat, rock pillar allowing Hemeth a rest.

While resting, Gundren approaches Cirrus with the Mummy's axe and offers it to the Warlock, as a gift to Selune.

Surprised by the gift from the cantankerous Dwarf, Cirrus takes the axe and begins a small ritual.

Amazingly, Cirrus and the axe are washed over by celestial energy and the axe fades, leaving behind a small perfect pearl.

Cirrus picks up the pearl, feeling an urge to use it - an Ioun stone of Non-detection.  The small pearl looks like a tiny moon orbiting the Warlocks head.

The rest, and indeed the rest of the following day travelling go by without issue, not seeing anything of note.  The lack of wildlife, or noise of any kind other than the ship being almost disconcerting as it paddles through absolute darkness and the soft glow of bio luminescence.

After many hours, Hemeth brings the ship to a halt in front of another seemingly blank rock wall and has the group repeat the signals from before.  The Duergar Lock opens its outer gate and the ship pulls in.

Entering the main pool of this second Lock the group sees that here, they are not alone.  Two ships are waiting for the locks in addition to their own: A ramshackle Kuo-Toa boat, the fishmen crowding the ship.  

The other boat though is...strange and indeed, looks more like a living, giant squid.  An Illithid craft.

Fey feels two psionic minds, one from the ship and one from the Fort.  They are aware of him and radiate subtle curiosity.

As Hemeth's vessel is docked, the Patches re-applies Gundren's Duergar disguise.

They also quickly discuss boarding the Illithid vessel, but Fey tells them its alive, and occupied.  Probably not the best idea...

They ignore the living vessel (for now) and head into the common room of the fort.

The group sits at a large table and begin to order food and drink.  Unlike the last Lock, they are not alone with the Duergar guards here.  A table of Kuo-Toa is crowded and covered in food, the fish men eating their fill and then rotating out with others from their boat.

More interestingly though is the Illithid standing in front of the crackling fireplace, warming its strange three fingered hand.

Gundren approaches the creature, wondering if they should attack the mindflayer, and asks it if its planning on enslaving anyone there.

The creature telepathically sighs and tells the Dwarf that of course, all the inferior races will bow before them...but not today.

Gundren chuckles and heads back to the group, just as Hemeth joins them from logging the boat in with the Dockmaster.

As they enjoy their meal, a burly Duergar in heavy splintmail with a large emblem of a hammer on his breast approaches Hemeth.  With the firelight shining from his bald head and his large white beard tucked into his tunic, the Duergar leans in to whisper to Hemeth.

Tark and Patches easily hear the Duergar Captain as he "whispers" to Hemeth:* "Hey Lad, quite a few surfacers on your boat, might be that you need to pay the transport Tax in advance today...  It would be a real shame to have to do a full inspection of your vessel, wouldnt it?"*
