**Prepping for Battle**

"Ah good, I've been expecting you". 

Aurinax looks over the group, introducing himself. He tells the group that there is a sitting room prepared for them and turns to begin walking through the grands cathedral of Helm.

The group inquires as to his odd appearance and he tells them, matter of factly, that he is a Gold Dragon, and the only Gold Dragon allowed in Waterdeep.

Fascinated, the group has many questions and they begin to converse with the polymorphed dragon as they walk.

Leaving the main chamber and entering side hallways Aurinax is friendly enough, remarking that he thinks Buumi is a little insane though to be going up against a Narzugon, an Archdevil of the Nine Hells.

After hearing this, the group is shocked and Buumi has to explain that he did not know, that he was operating off of his dream and commandments from Helm.

Chuckling, Aurinax lets the group know that they have about 9 hours until the ceremony and that he was the Dragon called in that remembered the ceremony from the last time it occurred some two centuries before. During which the champion was killed…

As they walk, Tark casually brings up that he "knows Bahamut" and Aurinax smiles, pointing at the monk's staff and mentioning that he figured as much as the staff is a branch of the Celestial Tree from Bahamut's divine realm.

They arrive at a set of nice doors and they open to reveal a well stocked sitting room, a table of food and drink prepared as well as a roaring fire around which many chairs are set.

The group heads inside and begin to make themselves comfortable.

Fey shows Aurinax the half burned letter from Neverwinter and asks if the dragon can assist with it, Aurinax chuckles and says he is very busy, but he has heard the group is accomplished and can probably figure it out.

The dragon walks over to Tark and places a hand on his shoulder, pointing to the golden scale on his hip and mentions that he thinks "She would be very proud".

Buumi shakily begins to take off his armor and get himself some food and drink (as Gundren and Tark begin to dig in too).

Aurinax decides to take his leave as he is very busy and opens the door. As he does, a Servant is about to knock.

The servant asks Aurinax if he can assist them in identifying an Ancient Red Dragon that has been spotted flying north near Myth Drannor.

Aurinax says he will help and walks into the hall.

The servant stays and addresses Cirrus. Telling the Baron that S'Olaa Al Kayan is in the main hall, by the Falls, with a guest and that they both wish to see him.

In the midst of doing inventory to find as much assistance for Buumi as possible, Cirrus thinks of blowing his brother off, but the Servant insists and Cirrus heads to the main Cathedral hall.

Staying in the sitting room, Patches begins preparing a small shrine in the corner of the room to Elistraee while Tark begins leading Buumi through stretches and massaging the terrified fellow to try and prep him for his test.

Buumi knows full well he will likely die in the fight, and that only by the power of Helm will he come back.  He is justifiably terrified.
  

Cirrus is led by an acolyte back to the main hall of the Cathedral and easily sees the magical waterfall in the center of the place.

Standing before it are two figures, the robed S'Olaa and another that Cirrus has not seen in months.

Clad in his magical cape, Kraken hilted cutlass on his hip and flowing blonde hair, Jack Myer Johnson Matthews spins dramatically as Cirrus approaches, calling out to his friend.

S'Olaa smiles and introduces "Whistler", what they have been calling JmJm in the Amnian Resolvers - the team of adventurers that work for Shaahir, of which JmJm is a part.

Shocked by this Cirrus asks his friend a number of questions, but JmJm is cagey.

S'Olaa begins to talk to Cirrus and apologizes for being so callous to him before, that he only knew him as the man that killed his father - he had since talked to the spirits of their father and mother and gotten the whole story.

Now knowing the whole story, S'Olaa hopes that he and their other siblings can have some sort of relationship with the estranged warlock.

Cirrus, taken aback by this change, agrees.  Surprised at the power of his brother to call back spirits, he asks S'Olaa how he managed it.

The amnian replies that he is the apprentice of Shaahir Al Selemchant, Archmage of Athkatla.

Cirrus takes his leave, walking from his brother (who has to go and deal with Abdul who is also at The Hold).

JmJm and Cirrus head back to the group.
  

Back in the sitting room, Patches begins to meditate and pray to Elistraee, focusing her efforts into a black pearl, hoping to create a boon for Buumi in the coming struggle.

A knock on the door causes most people to look up and Cirrus enters, with JmJm just behind.

Shocked, the group rushes over to greet their friend and hear his tale.

JmJm goes into a little more detail, explaining that he wandered the desert for a while, heading south.  He met up with some nomads and guarded them for a time until he came across a group of adventurers - The Amnian resolvers.  They told him their master could find anyone, and JmJm was still searching for Stephen so he joined with them.

Travelling south to Amn, JmJm began working with the Resolvers, doing jobs for Shaahir and earning the moniker of "whistler".

Then, disaster, one night, the Tavern of Doors was stolen and JmJm was no closer to finding Stephen.

JmJm suspects it was Shaahir that stole the Tavern, though he does not know why and has no proof.

As they continue to help Buumi prep, JmJm recalls an old song about the Narzugon and begins singing it to his friends, hoping to relay some information:  They learn they were once Paladins that fell to the Nine Hells and that they ride into battle atop Nightmares.

The group listens intently and continue to prepare for the evening, not hearing the knocks on the door to the room until a small squeaky voice interrupts them rom the doorway.

Looking through the now open door, a small Gnome with pink pig-tails, red wizard robes and a massive grey Maine-Coon cat draped across her shoulders, smiles at them: Delly Griplim of Neverwinter.

Delly greets them warmly and explains that she found their tale fascinating, especially their dealings with the Oni recently.  It jogged her memory of an old book from the far east and had a section translated for them, detailing the Oni and she hands over a small notebook.  She then turns to Fey and asks the wizard if he would want to help her and Mordy go over the Thayan Drop Box in a nearby room.

Without a ton to do other than wait and study, Fey agrees, eager to take a crack at the impressive item (though not thrilled about working with Mordy).

JmJm wants a look at the box too and he heads out with them, Delly summoning her impressive floating diamond throne and keeping pace with them as they head to another room.

Buumi decides to try and get some sleep and settles down for a bit.

Cirrus decides some motivation is in order for Buumi and uses a spell of Dreaming to depict a glorious Helm for the sleeping Paladin, inspiring him to acts of heroism.
  

JmJm, Fey and Delly make it to the Archmage's room and see Mordy pacing around the Thayan Box.  Laying on a small table, the strange box seems innocuous enough.  Stick, the sentient staff floats nearby.

Mordy greets the two newcomers and they all get to work inspecting the box.

As they look over it, JmJm calls upon his bardic magics to inspire his friend and in a flash of insight, Fey spots something.

On the side of the box are two intentional weak points, releases for the lid in case of an emergency.  He also realizes that the wards of the box are building in power and will detonate if the box is not opened soon, consuming the magic held within.

Informing the others, they come up with a plan to detonate the box early, under controlled circumstances and take the box to the main chamber of the Cathedral, clearing a section of all personnel.

With Mordy ready to Counterspell the wards, Fey and Delly set up lances of Force - modified Magic missiles - the slam into the weak points of the box.

They act, casting their spells and the box releases a dark pulse of death energy as the lances of force pierce the side.  Mordy counterspells, stealing a large amount of the destructive energy…all goes quiet.  The box lies open.

As the mages wonder and calculate any other potential dangers, JmJm strolls up to the open box and looks inside.

Inside, he sees a number of items, simply floating, suspended within and starts to pull them out, donning most of them. 

The wizards all rush forwards, shaking their heads at the impulsive Bard.

Delly and Mordy return to their room with the Box, determined to study it further, leaving Fey and JmJm to investigate the items they found within.
  

Back in the room, Fey sits down with the items (after coaxing JmJm to part with them) and pulls out his spellbook to begin identifying them.  After an hour of inspection he discovers each's purpose, including those that the Glyphs of the box had drained:

 +2 Venomous Dagger

Cloak of Fire resistance (drained)

Necklace of Fireballs (drained)

Mask of Clear Breath (immunity to gas weapons and attacks)

+1 Parrying Dagger

Greater Healing Potion

Fey looks this assortment of goods over and takes another look at the half burned letter, now sure that this box contained assassination equipment for whatever is going down in the city of Neverwinter.

JmJm picks up all of the equipment and begins to put it on, gaining a raised eyebrow from fey and a sidelong glare from Patches.

Eventually, the time comes and Buumi is woken up from his dreams of heroism and begins to don his armor.

He's feeling much better and less terrified than before thanks to his friends.

Patches hands him the small black pearl and hopes that it will grant him a measure of luck and blessing from Elistraee.

The door opens and Aurinax has come to collect the group.

They head from the sitting room and begin making their way through the halls of the Hold.

Aurinax explains that they are going deep beneath the Hold, to ancient catacombs in the Upperdark from millennia ago and they need to take several elevators to get there.

They head deep into the depths of Helm's Hold, past catacombs of newly dead, many of paladins recently fallen to the Undead Mists from the last year. The first layers have candles and acolytes tending to crypts.

Then deeper, past ancient tombs and through rough hewn tunnels, the light becomes more scarce with only the occasional glowing crystal for light.

The first elevator looks old but serviceable, and Aurinax throws the switch and it drops into the depths.

Stopping a minute later, the dragon steps off and begins leading again, through mostly natural tunnels, the smell of sulfur growing along with a humid warmth in the tunnels.

As the group goes, Patches swipes the Venomous dagger from JmJm as the bard is distracted.

Tark begins asking questions about the ethics of summoning and fighting a Devil, even if commanded by a "god" and why this whole thing is necessary in the first place.

As the group begins bickering, Aurinax tries to get the groups attention until he finally has to shout over their commotion that "BAHAMUT HAS ONE OF THE FRAGMENTS!".

Finally getting their attention, he goes on to explain that his lord Bahamut has a fragment of the Last Word secreted away in the divine domain of Mount Celestia.

He asks if the group would like their two fragments taken to Bahamut and safeguarded there.

The group is unsure and asks how they would even get there to which Aurinax replies that he would take the two pieces to the current ruler of all Metallic Dragons - Protanther who would personally take them to Mount Celestia.

The group says they will think about it.

Finally approaching the second elevator to head down to the summoning chamber, the group sees a figure waiting by the ancient contraption.

Approaching, they see a blonde elf in a blue gown and recognize the Blue Dragon Anaxtrasa, the new owner of Ravenloft castle.

The group greets her and she smiles at the group, thanking them for her magnificent new home.  JmJm flirts with her a little and she makes a kissy face at him, shocking him with a bit of lightning.

Aurinax greets Ana like an old friend and they quickly begin bickering, showing some history.

Aurinax tells the group to take the elevator and head down as he has some things to chat with Ana about.

Just as the group begins to leave they hear Aurinax ask Anaxtrasa if her mother is still messing around with the Storm Giants, eliciting a glare from the blue dragon and Ana looking over her shoulder to see if the group heard…which they did…

The group throws the lever on the elevator and it drops into the dark depths.
  

The ancient elevator rumbles to a stop and the group sees a short tunnel in front of them, the area ahead lit by a reddish glow and the air now uncomfortably warm, the scent of volcanic gasses strong.

A cleric meets them off the elevator and leads them the last two dozen feet to the Trials.

**The Trials**

Approaching the end of the tunnel, the group looks over a huge, ancient arena, the floor crisscrossed by glowing cracks venting volcanic gasses.

The arena is surrounded by a 15ft wall, atop which are rows of inclined stone seating built into the walls of the cavern.  The group is atop this wall, looking out from one of two entrances - tunnels.

Two paladins of helm guard each tunnel and four clerics can be seen in the arena, huddled around a massive copper brazier, burning bright.

Twenty feet away, in the stands are three figures watching over the proceedings: An older halfling woman in cleric garb of Helm, a human Paladin woman in the garb of Lathander and a Dark skinned elf man with a gold shining breastplate taking down notes in a large book.

The two groups nod at each other in greeting as Buumi leaps down to the floor of the arena with a metallic thud, throwing up rock chips.

The group (save Patches) walks around to the midline of the stands and prepare to watch the coming battle - they notice at the foot of the wall beneath them a golden ring of metal, a massive summoning ring to contain whatever is brought through and a massive chunk of crystal embedded In the ceiling of the place, directly above the Brazier.

Buumi walks near the center, preparing and summoning his Wings of Flying, the angelic wings erupting from his back.  JmJm lets out a coo of appreciation.

The chanting clerics back away from the brazier, the flame within now growing and they leave the arena, the summoning spell now in full swing.

Behind Patches, Javen Tarkimov (Head of the Paladins of Helm) steps from the elevator and heads in to the stands watch Buumi fight.

The brazier erupts, lines of energy exploding out in a shattered pattern and a hulking creature steps from the flames.

9ft tall and clad in black plate armor, the skin beneath looking like cracked and cooling lava. Two red glowing eyes peer out from the visored helm and in its hands are a sword made of flame and a slab-like metal shield.

The Narzugon surveys the arena, turning and looking at everything, its gaze lingering on the brazier.

Buumi calls back, asking if the thing is meant to be so big for a Narzugon.

The creature laughs and in common replies that it is not "a" Narzugon, but "THE" Narzugon, the Archdevil himself. The first Paladin to lose his soul to the Nine Hells.

The creature surges forward, trading powerful blows with Buumi, hurting the Paladin and then kicking him back a dozen feet.

As Buumi scrapes across the ground, Narzugon turns and plunges his sword into the brazier, causing a second eruption and letting out a great cry in Infernal.

As Buumi struggles to stand, a horde of Devils rush from the summoning gate: 20 Bearded Devil Legionnaires and 6 other lesser Narzugon.  They rush forwards and begin assaulting the barrier containing them, the Narzugon plunging their fiery weapons into the stone to begin melting through the golden circle while the Legionnaires try to cut through the flickering energy barrier generated by it.

Seeing the catastrophe unfolding, Fey extends his arcane senses and feels the barriers of the planes shattered, centering on the cluster of Faerzress crystals in the ceiling above the Brazier. He points this out to Gundren and the Dwarf pulls his cannon out to begin firing on the crystals.

Tark shadowsteps into the arena, immediately shattering the shield preventing the Devils from leaving as he races to assist his friend.

The Devils begin climbing out of the Arena and the Paladins and Clerics surge forward to engage.

Patches leaps into the arena, attacking a Narzugon and hurling a smoke bomb as JmJm rushes forward, donning a Mysterious Glove From His Pasttm and creating an Arcane hand to assault Narzugon.

Cirrus, hearing Infernal for the first time realizes that he can understand the language and rushes over near the Legionnaires to attempt to command them to halt in their assault…
