**The Steam Caves**

The Massive corpse rises to its feet, visible through the thick steam.  

The corpse shudders and rips apart, the arms splitting from mid hand all the way up to the joint as the possessing creature violates the massive body.

JmJm rushes forward to engage the vile thing, followed quickly by Patches and Tark.

The massive thing takes brutal hits from the group, seeming not to care as its body is damaged.  In response, it sweeps JmJm and Patches up in it's tentacle-like arms, crushing them.

Doc B summons a Moonbeam on the thing while Fey hurls firebolt after bolt into the corpse and Cirrus summons the glittering armor of the Intellect Fortress.

The creature is quickly ripped apart, but not before swallowing JmJm.  

As the massive creature has its head blown off by Eldritch Blasts, another great form rises and lurches out of the steam.  

Another of the creatures attacks.

JmJm crawls out of the first monster, now destroyed, just in time to see Tark swallowed by by the second massive undead thing.

Gundren surveys the battlefield and notes a small glowing Jellyfish rise from the first corpse.  He fires on it but fails to kill it.

Like the first creature, the second proves dangerous and brutal, but the group destroys it relatively quickly.  Tark even bursting from its rotten stomach in a deluge of foul liquid.

As the second creature dies, another Jellyfish rises out of the corpse.  JmJm hacks away at it and it disintegrates to ash.

The other Jelly flees the area and the group does not pursue.

Looking around the battlefield and inspecting the bodies, the group discovers a few things of note.

Patches harvests some good cooking salt from one of the vents.

Doc B finds a massive 10lb salt crystal down a side area and returns to the group with it.

Fey, JmJm and Cirrus all look over the bodies, recognizing them as a subspecies of Froghemoth and the Jellies as a type of Demon.

Deciding to get some rest, the group heads down a side tunnel to find a good spot to set up Cirrus' Tiny Hut.

They pick an alcove, set up the Hut and then Doc B Molds and shifts the earth to cover the dome, leaving only a long crack for ventilation and a very thin section to act as a way to "escape".

The group settles in for a secure nights rest.

**The Rock Covered Hut**

 Inside the walled off hut Patches begins to discuss entering Menzoberranzan, recounting the rules of Lolth.

Worship of any entity other than Lolth is banned on pain of death. Refusing an order from a priestess results in punishment up to and including death. Slaves have no legal protection. Pretending to be a Drow when you are not, or a specific Drow when you are not will result in death. If there are no witnesses to a crime, no crime was committed. 

As Patches tells an attentive Tark, some of the others are discussing their Drow disguises for entering the city.  They stop pretty quickly when it's pointed out that if that's discovered it means death.

During the discussion, the group realizes that they don't even know if Finn is in Menzoberranzan and decide to scry on him.

Not having it prepared, Fey turns to Doc to cast the spell.

Doc can cast it but has no focus to do so, he says he needs a crystal worth at least 1000g.  

Patches sighs and takes out the large chunk of Amethyst she picked up in the elemental Geode and hands it over to Doc.

Doc proceeds to scry on Finn, getting a vision of a Drow fortress; carved spires of rock glowing with arcane fires and a nimbus of energy.  The vision cuts off as it tries to enter the compound, hitting the wards. 

Instead of heading directly to the Drow City, Patches mentions heading to Gracksuluth first to try and secure travel and status documents from her underground contacts there.

Cirrus agrees as he too has business in Gracksuluth with another Warlock of Ceregorach.

The group decides to head across the Darklake to the Duergar city.

Gundren finishes up the jeweled bowl for Doc B and hands it to the little Gnome.

The group enjoys a meal of the Bluecap bread and rations and settle in to sleep.

Cirrus, feeling rejected and far from his goddess begins to indulge far too heavily in his smoking and eating Mayonnaise.  He vomits and passes out.

Seeing his companion unconscious, Gundren moves in to keep working on his project.  Propping the Warlock up, he takes the final measurements of the Tiefling's gums and mouth.

Gundren fits Cirrus with a set of silver dentures, nailing them into place into the bone.  Stepping back and admiring the handiwork, Gundren nods in satisfaction and heads to bed.

Fey stays up, staring at the Tiny hut and thinking he can do better.  He finishes the last few equations of his new spell and then settles in for his Reverie.

The night is uneventful other than another round of nightmares of dark things chasing and consuming the group in the depths.

Waking up in the morning, Cirrus yells at the group excitedly.

He thinks that the silver teeth are a blessing from his goddess and the rest of the group goes along with it, not wanting to burst his bubble.

Cirrus tries to eat some solid food for the first time in a while, and bites his tongue pretty badly, not used to having teeth.

With the silver eyes and teeth, the warlock is looking quite freaky.

JmJm wakes and rises from his silken bed roll, completely naked.

Patches rolls her eyes and casts darkness on the Bard, obscuring him completely, and filling the tiny hut.

She relents and removes the Darkness once JmJm sighs and covers himself.

The group pack up and go to leave, needing to crack through the stone crust enacted the night before.  Doc B points out the spot to try and crack through and Tark leaps at it, smashing through the wall.

It hurt.  Tark lands on the other side, holding his bruised shoulder and looking back at the cracked rock wall, and the thin section just next to where he pushed through.

The group head out, returning to the Steam Caverns and heading on, down the tunnel Patches recognized the day before that leads to a Drow made bridge across a chasm.

**The Severed Bridge & the Sphere**

 ​Travelling to the bridge and chasm is relatively quick and easy and they make it there within three uneventful hours.

The tunnel widens and turns, the wall simply disappearing into darkness as the tunnel opens to the chasm.

Walking along the ledge, they arrive to the location of the bridge and note that it has been destroyed.

Great braids of spider silk are attached to the wall here, but they end after a few feet, burned away.

Cirrus sends his owl out to see how far it is to the other side.  The little bird quickly discovers that it's about 200ft across the abyss.

Not wanting to mess around, the group petition Doc B to Wind Walk them for the day and the Cat-Gnome agrees, puffing on his pipe and exhaling the swirling cloud that scoops them up in its wake.

The group rushes across the chasm, past a waiting Roper - a Stalactite looking monstrosity, and through the next tunnel.

Travel is much faster and safer, but nowhere near as quick as above ground as the group still needs to stop and discern their path.

Many hours and many miles later, the group is travelling still when they are all knocked from the spell, a surge of wild-magic disrupting the Druidic casting.

Looking around for the source of the disturbance, the group continues on with Patches leading.

They find the source not long after; a massive black sphere taking up the majority of a cavern with the bones of hundreds of creatures beneath it.

Seeing the bones as a clear warning, no one touches the thing but Fey, Cirrus and JmJm all move in to inspect it while Gundren inspects the bones.

They quickly discern the sphere to be a chunk of the Negative Energy plane; pure death.

Hearing about planes again, Tark enacts the magic of his blindfold and immediately notes the planar cracks around the sphere, the gold glowing fissures seemingly focused on this spot.

Gundren meanwhile, sees something shiny among the bones and recovers it, making sure to not touch the sphere.  He stands up, holding and Ivory figurine depicting a Winged Owlbear.

Gundren can feel the magic in the thing and thinks he knows exactly what it is; a figurine of Wondrous power.  He stashes it for later.

Inspecting the cavern, the group realizes they want to be on the other side of the sphere and begin to look for a way around.  They find a section that provides a small 2ft gap between the sphere of death and the wall of the cavern. 

The group asks Doc nicely to move the earth away and he does so, creating a much larger opening for the group to easily move through.

They continue on.

**The Fantastic Fortress and the Mind Flayer**

Despite having Wind Walked for most of the day, the group decides to begin looking for a place to rest. 

The group is beginning to see more flora and fauna, glowing worms, mosses and mushrooms.

As they discuss it, the talking gets a little loud and everyone is shocked into silence when they hear something up ahead.

Fey'Anon turns to the rock wall and casts his new spell: Fey'Anon's Magnificent Mansion, an elegant silver door appearing in the rock.

Before anyone can go inside, Fey stops them and talks about the Bags of Holding and the issues bringing them inside may cause; as such the door has a deposit area next to it for extra planar bags.

The group is not too happy about having to leave their stuff outside, even with a shaped earth pocket to leave their things in.

Cirrus enacts a Tiny hut around the entrance as an extra precaution.  

Tark and Patches both decide to stay outside with Cirrus to keep guard.

Everyone else heads into the Magnificent Mansion and are astounded by its Majesty.  Much like the mansions and grand structures of Silverymoon, the interior is all sweeping marble, rich hardwoods and silver filigree, the high-elven architecture evident.  As they look in awe, Fey mentions that he built it after the fashion of Evermeet, his childhood home.

The group inside begin to get pampered by unseen servants and enjoy the massive banquet prepared for them inside.

Meanwhile, those outside don't know what they are missing.

Patches, Tark and Cirrus eat a little and then bed down in silence, watching and keeping guard.  

An hour goes by with Tark and Patches taking the first rest while Cirrus keeps watch.

Just as Tark is about to go to sleep, he sees a strange spot on the stone outside the dome.  Peering at it, it suddenly moved, shifting into the stone.  He got a good enough look at it though; a Mindflayer!

Tark bolts up and lets Patches and Cirrus know and then rushes into the Mansion to let the others know.

Bursting into the mansion, Tark takes a moment to be shocked at how opulent it is, and then yells out that a Mindflayer was watching them in the Dome and he sensed more of them waiting out there.

The group discusses what to do but end up deciding that between the Tiny Hut and the Magnificent Mansion, they are fine and the Mind flayers will go away.

Patches has come in at this point as well and spots a naked JmJm waltzing around with a crystal glass of wine.  She casts darkness on him and smiles as she hears him trip and drop the glass.

Tark and Patches head back out to the dome and Cirrus tells them nothing else has happened.

They settle in to rest.

Later that night, Cirrus is thinking about his goddess and blinks.  As his eyes re-open, the dome is gone, dispelled and a wave of psionic energy washes over him.  He shrugs it off and turns to see a Mindflayer not 5ft from him.

Cirrus yells.

Patches springs forward, weapons materializing in her hands and goes to strike the tentacled intruder.

As her weapons reach it, the Mindflayer calls out into their minds "Wait!" and then enacts a Planeshift.  It explodes into giblets, showering the area in purple blood and gore.

Patches stands there shocked, and covered in filth.

Tark goes invisible, standing next to the Bags of Holding while the other two head into the Mansion.

Cirrus exclaims his wonder at the opulent mansion as he and Patches see Fey float down from a balcony.

Fey looks at the dirty Drow unappreciatively but Doc rushes over with a towel and begins to help her clean up.

Cirrus and Patches tell the others what happened and Fey is shocked; At the mindflayer exploding and seemingly wanting to talk?

Concerned but still feeling quite secure in the mansion, the group decides to worry about it all in the morning.

Cirrus and Patches head back outside and re establish another Tiny Hut.  

They remain on edge the rest of the night, looking out into the darkness for more Mind Flayers.
