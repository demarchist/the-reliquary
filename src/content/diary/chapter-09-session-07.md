Returned to the Barony, the group splits up.

Feanon heads down from his teleportation chamber to the floor of his tower containing the lab, the Sarcophagus and his waiting staff.

Patches heads to Over the Moon with Samid and Thorna, intent on penning some letters and setting the Bedine trader up in a nice room.

Gundren heads to his Manufactory, intent to see how his brothers and Surtr have been doing with the work he left them.

Tark heads with Gundren, but veers off to find and talk to Buumi, despite the late hour.

Doc B returns to his grove.

Cirrus takes a handful of Chardalyn chips and heads to his Fane to commune with his goddess.

Snorbul heads to his mining hole for a good night's sleep.


In Feanon’s tower, the wizards have all gathered and begin to pour over the sarcophagus (carefully), knowing full well the danger it represents.

They confirm that the Sarcophagus is over 10,000 years old and most likely a relic of The Crown Wars.

The libraries of Evermeet date that far back and the Sage Beryan sends to her colleagues to begin searching for the names: **Abraxim, Halashnar and Quil’Sygoth**.

Confident in the sages of Evermeet, Feanon retires for the evening.


Patches meanwhile has sent missives to Lady Fae asking for: Contact with Lo’Dan and an Archaeologist to run the Auction house in town.

She then heads to her sanctum beneath the Fane and sets up the large shard of Chardalyn she recovered at its center.

She then arranges the chips around it.  Nodding in satisfaction, Patches asks if Elistraee likes it.

She gets no response, swears and leaves to go and rest.


Cirrus has done a similar thing high above in his own sanctum, having set up the Chardalyn chips at his personal altar.

Cirrus then proceeds to yodel his prayers to his goddess, asking if she likes the offering.

One of the chips glows a soft white. 

Cirrus takes out the Well of Many Worlds and casts it against the wall.

It opens to the Astral Plane and gets a view of a small village on a cluster of floating rocks amidst the Starry Sea.

Sighing in frustration that it was not Ysgard, Cirrus closes the portal.

He asks if Selune wishes him to visit her in her home Plane.

The light in the Chardalyn dims, before growing bright again after a few minutes.

Cirrus is a little distraught by this, taking it as a negative to his question.

He spends the rest of his night in prayer.


Gundren and his brothers have done fine work back at the Manufactory, they have produced 6 amulets of stealth.

Satisfied with his work, Gundren then goes to sleep.


Tark heads through the Chapel of Helm, crossing the raised platform beneath the stained glass dome.

At the center of the raised platform, a golden plate is embedded into the floor, depicting the watchful eye of helm.

Tark heads on, finding Buumi’s somewhat austere room.

Knocking at the door, Buumi wakes and invites his troubled friend inside.

Tark proceeds to vent to Buumi about the group and their lies and that he thinks Feanon brought a dangerous evil back to the Barony and is lying about it.

Buumi listens and does his best to console his friend, mentioning that he is hoping to guide them toward righteousness over time and that they ARE doing good in the world AND getting better.

Tark agrees half-heartedly not really buying it.

The two of them decide to visit Feanon in the morning and make him come clean.

Tark heads to his treehouse to feed the baby Cave-bear, he spends the evening thinking over the morality of the group.


The next morning, Feanon is visited by his friends Buumi and Tark

They arrive early, coming into the foyer of the tower and finding it deserted, until a small flying creature races upstairs followed in short order by a halfling.

After some banter, they make it to the elevator with access badges and head up to the laboratory to meet Feanon, leaving Guiseppe to hunt the Pugasis.

Feanon welcomes them into his lab and almost immediately begins to apologize to Tark.

In short order, he also takes the cloth covering off of the sarcophagus and admits to its presence.

A little taken aback, Buumi and Tark have Feanon promise to kill the creature as soon as possible.

He agrees.

They still decide that they should all sit down over dinner and talk the recent events through.  Trust is important.

The group goes about their day, praying, crafting and contacting friends.

Buumi stops by the tavern for lunch  with the Dragonborn knights, he mentions to Patches they are heading to Kossenberg to be shown the local pathways through the forest.

Patches visits Claudine who finishes and delivers 6x potions of poison resistance.

She talks to Marzeline, telling the girl that she expects her to train in the sword.

Marzeline is surprised but agrees, saying she will go with the Paladin recruits to train (they asked her recently).

Patches agrees, but warns her of  the Paladins religion.

The evening rolls around with a light storm blowing in and beginning to sprinkle the area with water.

Gundren, Tark, Patches, Cirrus, Buumi and Feanon all meet at Over the Moon for Dinner.

They dine extensively, the establishment now fully stocked with food and drink.

Other patrons give the group a respectful distance, but dine in the establishment too, the Dwarven basement being particularly bustling.

Snorbul meanwhile has dragged Thorna over to the “Hole” and is proceeding to talk her ear off about his plans for a subterranean Gladiator pit.

Back at the Tavern, the group discusses recent events and Feanon feels a little targeted.

In short order, the group goes over their issues and find that talking about it helps.

They go back to their food feeling a little better about thing with Feanon promising no more unilateral action if it could harm the group or those living in the Barony.

The storm outside grows more intense and Feanon feels that it is no longer natural.

Feanon mentions that an Aboleth might be visiting soon.

Everyone at the table looks at him flabbergasted.

Patches sends Mr. Pickles into the tunnels to head out to her Sanctum. 

Around the Tavern, patrons begin to spit fouled water and in short order Buumi spits his drink out.

Fea confirms the presence of the Aboleth is fouling the water.

Down below, Mr Pickles stares at the mucus covered tunnel walls he has found.

He returns to Patches to tell her and It confirms it for Fea, The Abolethic Sovereignty has arrived.

A man stumbles in from the rain, a coral barb protruding from his chest as the flesh around it dissolves.

People look in horror as the man’s torso is dissolved.

The group  scrambles into action, quickly shepherding the civilians into the safety of the basement.

Gundren rushes upstairs with Fea, taking position on the second floor and looking out across the Crossroads of New Daggerford.

Tark peeks out the door and another Coral lance pierces it, quickly dissolving a hole.

They peer out into the night and spot the shooter

The strange creature is adhered to the side of a building, wielding a Coral Lance.

Another barb sails in from the lance and Tark catches it, throwing it aside as it vomits out a line of acid.

Out in the rain, lightning illuminating the scene, fish-like humanoids splash through the mud.

In the distance, houses are broken into and the new civilians of New Daggerford scream as piscine monsters tear them from their beds.

A small army of the creatures rush forwards toward the tavern.

The group steps out to meet them.

Gunfire and spells rain from the second floor and Patches snipes with her crossbow.

Buumi rushes forward with Tark to engage in melee and Cirrus begins to lash out with Eldritch blasts.

The sea-folk begin to fall rapidly, with the pale, octopus-like creature with the lance dying first in a shower of ichor.

Cirrus calls to his goddess and the air tears, a globe of silver light hanging in the air before boiling away leaving a flaming celestial in its place.

The Seraphim quickly lays waste to all before it.

In a matter of moments, the raid has been completely stalled with the forward ranks getting annihilated.

The back ranks however have already begun to retreat with their prisoners and the group can see the pale forms through the rain disappearing into the swaying trees of the dark forest.

Thunder rumbles, the wind howls and lightning flashes as the Sovereignty drags the civilians toward the lake…
