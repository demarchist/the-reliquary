The group looks across the coast, to the towering cliffs and the rocky beach below.

It’s sheer for a good two hundred feet and the group has no desire to climb a sheer rock face.

They have the captain of the Fiery Flower move along the coast a little ways to find a better landing point.

They find it in the form of a rockslide, having formed a steep ramp many years ago and providing a more reasonable ascent.

The ship drops anchor and the group gets into the dinghy.

They quickly row to shore, take their supplies and begin the trek in-land, leaving the ship moored and waiting for at least four days (The group will be back by then…they think)

The ascent up the rock beach and collapsed cliff front is hard going, but manageable.

There are a few slips and tumbles, but nothing of significance

Cirrus needs/wants to be carried over the finish line and Snorbul obliges his weak friend.

At the top of the cliffs, the group surveys the area, getting a fine view of the alien coastline.

The green sky reflects in the dark ocean.

Inland appears to be nothing but badlands.

Red dirt and arid rock as far as the eye can see, save for a large gleaming stone edifice in the distance, with a swirling mass of dark clouds above.

Purple lightning can be seen flickering in the clouds above the Temple of Carthus, Wild Magic surges in the area.

The group begins their trek to the temple across the blasted wastes.

Everything is dead here and blasted away from the temple, as if it was the center of a great explosion.

Feanon theorizes that it was a location of Planer-shatteringly-powerful magic that caused this devastation.

Nearby, Tark notes movement and alerts the party.

A hunting pack of raptor-like lizards strides across the arid landscape, directly toward the party.

Tark leaps away, luring half of the hunters in pursuit while the rest of the group turns to defend themselves.

The feathered Raptors lash out and attack furiously, but the skilled group is too much for a pack of simple beasts to take on.

They are quickly killed.

Tark sees this and heads back to the group, leading his trailing raptors into a trap.

The fight is over quickly.

They do what they can to quickly harvest the bodies of meat and usable feathers and bone.

They move on.

They arrive at the temple a few hours later.

In a sandy field along stands a huge domed structure of ancient saurian design; white marble and angular pillars with gold decor and filigree. Its hexagonal sides are open to the elements, revealing a large set of primordial monoliths cut out of solid marble stone.  An intricate dias is in the middle of the chamber. This site would be lovely, if it wasnt for the piles of bones covered in webs of blight and black spores drifting in the air. The interior and exterior of the temple is littered with remains and corruption. 

Feanon notes that as they have approached this place, he has felt a psionic energy in the very land itself emanating from this place.

It looks deserted but ominous.

The Wild magic lightning flashes overhead.

Well, they’re the Faerun Defense Force and Heralds of Woe! They walk toward the temple.

Liara reiterates that no one has succeeded in a pilgrimage in centuries and gestures to the significant number of bones in the area.

As they approach, they come on guard, heading toward the main entrance in front of them and intent on the Monoliths inside.

They spot that each monolith has a symbol glowing in the center, each a different color.

They begin to ascend the steps of the temple when the Lightning flashes and 8 blasts of wild magic split the air around the temple.

The lightning rends the air and tears in reality appear to the Shadowfell of this word.

8 creatures rush through, wailing.

The group quickly forms a defense at the door to the Temple.

The creatures close quickly and prove to be quite deadly in close combat.

With blasts of psychic power, the creatures try to invoke fear and terror in the party.

With varying success, several of the group flee their positions before overcoming the psionic terror.

Cirrus is convinced that the Shadofell creatures cannot enter the sacred temple and steps inside further.

One of the Lost enters the temple and attacks the open Warlock.

He falls back ass Gundren comes to his rescue.

Cirrus then steps atop the central dias and vanishes in a flash of light, teleported.

Liara moves to follow and the group considers a retreat through to the temple interior (they assume)

Feanon casts a powerful spell but it causes a wild magic surge, unsure what it might have done, Feanon returns to the fighting until he smells foul food.  The rations have spoiled…

The battle for the Lost could go either way as the group holds the doors.

That is, until Snorbul manages to flank and hacks two of them apart with a roar!

The tide turns with the sudden change in numbers and the group smashes the remaining creatures.

Wounded and sweating in the arid environment, they look around at the spore ridden temple, eyes settling on the Dias which teleported their friend.

Buumi steps forward and with a flash, vanishes.

In the darkness between, he hears a voice ask in his mind “*What do you seek at this font of Power? Authority and Control? Justice and Truth? Harmony and Balance? Wealth and Security? Change and Reform? Or Knowledge and Insight?*

*Who is most important in your life that embodies this trait?*

Buumi’s mind immediately settles on Harmony and Balance and thinks of his Mother…

The rest of the group stands by the Dias, deciding what to do next.
