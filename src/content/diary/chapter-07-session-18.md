**The Attack**

The fires of the explosion disperse in the air, catching alight tapestries and the wooden beams of the ceiling.**​**

The ruined grand windows of the dining hall burn with walls of fire, obscuring the outside and burning away at the front of the building.

Fey comes to his feet and slams his staff down, calling on its ice magic and a crystalline wall of ice forms, covering the burning walls, windows and blocking the wall of fire.

The light cascading through the ice wall is beautiful.

Neverember's bodyguards rush to their injured lord and clasp pendants around their necks, vanishing as they Dimension Door their Lord to safety.

Suddenly, a voice speaks into Fey's mind, the Dwarven banker Goldhold - The Sundabar Vault is under attack from unknown blue-skinned giants that appeared from "nowhere";  Oni.

Patches rushes from the room, out into the hall to follow Abdul and finds his burned corpse splayed out in the foyer, ash and burning debris scattered throughout.

Patches searches Abdul, quickly looting the corpse of its signet rings and valuables.  She picks up the Tobbacco pouch and tosses it away.  It slides across the marble floor, to the booted feet of two figures. She notes the movement and darts behind the Foyer fountain to hide.

rounding the corner, two assassins in red cloaks, beaked gas masks, dark leather armor and wielding the venomous daggers from the Thayan boxes step into view...

The house shudders as more explosions impact the building.  Between the roar of the fires and the worsening rain fall, its getting harder to hear inside.

The raging fires begin to fill the house with smoke.  The screams of servants on other floors and in other areas can be heard above the roar of the flames.

Gundren pats some fires out on his cloak, the door out from the kitchens wreathed in flames.  Two figures step into the doorway, rushing forwards to attack him.  Assassins.

The first rushes to the prone dwarf, stabbing wildly.  Gundren manages to twist and squirm, keeping the figure from landing any serious blows.  As the weapons break skin, he feels the burn of insidious poison.  The poison is almost instantly neutralized though as the healing effects of Doc B's Heroes Feast negate it.

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day it seems...

The other assassin explodes into smoke, disappearing and earning the monkier of "smokestalker".

As Gundren struggles with the assassin, looking out of the back door of the kitchens and manor, he sees several figures; two Amnian Veterans in plate and a smaller figure farther back. Two arrows smack into the table above him before puffing away into smoke.

JmJm looks around, gaining his footing in the dining hall and taking stock of the situation.  He turns and heals Chani, the woman looking burned and beginning to cough.  He then takes cover by the door out of the Dining hall.

As he does this, a hissing ball of gas appears in the center of the Dining hall, spewing forth a caustic fog: Cloudkill.

Kurt, burned and laying on the ground quickly gags on the gas, with a spasm before lying still. Dead.

Sera cries out in anguish as she helps her other son, Ernst, up and he pops a potion, healing and creating force armor around his noble clothes.

Cirrus rushes to Sera's side, enacting an Globe of Invulnerability from his staff.  Wherever the globe goes, the Cloudkill gas simply ceases to exist.  The civilians crowd into the bubble for protection and Cirrus moves out into the hall. Buumi collects the body of Kurt, moving with the group and calling upon Helm for an Aura of Vitality.

Cries of pain and death can be heard throughout the manor as servants are silenced by the intruders and the two assassins in the hall see Cirrus and the Civilians begin to pile out of the Dining hall. They both pull gems from their necklaces and throw them at the group, but the fire-ball gems shatter as they hit the Globe of Invulnerability.

Gneiss looks around the dining room and rushes to the double doors leading to the Ballroom.  The big man grabs Fey'Anon and plows through the doors, dragging the mage with him. As he stumbles out of the cloudkill (with labored breathing) and into the Ballroom, he sees two more assassins waiting for them, strange repeating crossbows in hand and they loose a volley at the two of them.

Fey and Gneiss are both hit numerous times, the stinging bolts carrying poison that is negated by the Heroes Feast.

Upstairs, Tark was in his room relaxing when the attack occurred. Startled, the Monk rushes from the room to the nearby window on the third floor, smoke thick in the air and seeing servants rushing to the stairs.  Outside, he sees chaos.

Floating sixty feet up and forty feet from the house is a red-robed figure, orbs of fire orbiting its head and as Tark looks, two of them lance out to strike the manor, exploding.  

Below it on the ground, Tark spots several figures that he recognizes, noting the raging fires burning at the manor house.  

He sees Farrim, the Amnian Wizard, Salama the Cleric and Dellig the halfling Archer from the group that attacked them in Silverymoon.  

In the background of the wider cityscape, he also notes numerous fires throughout and spots the blast of a fireball go off.  

Far off, past the castle down in the harbor, Tark sees a massive winged form appear and breath a jet of flame across the docks - an Ancient Red Dragon.

With a yell, Tark leaps from the window, shattering it and Shadowstepping the rest of the way to strike at the floating Red-Robed figure. He takes it completely by surprise and stuns it. He smashes into the form before starting to fall.  Tark reaches out to grab at the robes but they are insubstantial - an illusion and the Monk falls to the ground, landing in a crouch.  As he falls, he looks up at the creature and sees a familiar face under the hood - the little girl, Cercei.  They eyes looking back at him are cold and in a flash of insight, Tark recognizes a possession.  Something has taken control of her body.

Chani sees Gneiss rush out of the Dining Hall with Fey and she rushes to follow, moving in to engage the two Assassins attacking the group.

Gundren continues to wrestle with the assassin, with a call, Gwen rushes in with tooth and claw and the two of them begin to harry the Assassin.  The attacker calls out in surprise as an easy kill turns into a proper fight.

Outside, the Half-Orc Cleric; Salama, spins and unleashes a Radiant Flame upon Tark, but the agile monk dodges the radiant explosion and Salama swears.

Doc B rushes from the dining hall to take cover behind the fountain.  Spotting an assassin, she lashes out with her Thorn Whip but the agile enemy parries and moves into cover.

**​**Fey sees the two assassins rushing forward and decides that Gneiss will make an excellent bodyguard and hastes the big man before replying to Goldhold via Sending Stone.

Fey asks the situation and the beleaguered Dwarf replies that they have dropped the tunnel into the vault but Several Oni turned to gas and slipped through the cracks, the Dwarves are currently holding the Vault entrance but are engaged in a pitched battle waiting for reinforcements.

Outside, lightning flashes across the sky and Tark sees six objects or figures falling out of the sky directly above the castle, impacting the roof and smashing through moments later.  The Dragon in the harbor takes flight and begins strafing the ships in harbor.

The two assassins in the Ballroom engage Gneiss and Chani, striking with their wicked daggers.  Gneiss' armor manages to deflect several blows, but more slip through, the big man is looking hurt.

 Chani leaps off of her companions back, landing behind the two assassins facing Gneiss and flanking them with a flurry of blows. Both assassins they face are looking beleaguered and bloody.

In the foyer outside the Dining  hall and Ballroom a voice booms forth, chuckling and Li Xian appears from invisibility.  He turns a bag inside out and from it two Zombies tumble - Georg and Marta, the corpses rising to their feet. Li Xian calls to the group, lamenting that he had prepared the zombies for the children, but that the group would have to suffice.  The hulking Oni then turns and disappears around a corner, turning invisible as he goes.  Moments later, a blast of necrotic energy, a Cirlce of Death erupts by Cirrus. Sera falls dead to the floor, a desiccated husk, the globe of invulnerability doing nothing to counter the powerful magic.

Ernst and Buumi both cry out, seeing their mother fall.

The zombies shamble quickly forward to engage the Warlock and Ernst.

Patches rushes past to engage the Assassins further down the hall, seeing them prepare repeating crossbows. She throws herself into combat her weapons clashing with those of the red-cloaked assassin.

Li Xian appears near the battling Patches and reaches forth a clawed finger, a lance of blue energy hitting the Drow and chilling her.

The Assassin fighting Patches manages to land a strike but takes one in turn, the two expert combatants holding their own against one another.  Seeing what he's up against, the assassin misty steps away as two more assassins misty step into combat, flanking the rogue as Li Xian fires another Ray of Frost at the rogue, her position quickly worsening.

The Red Robed creature turns to see Tark below it, sending forth two fiery orbs to explode by the monk.  The monk manages to dodge the worst of the explosions but is burned slightly.

Smoke begins to fill the house and parts of the roof begin to collapse inwards as the fires rage.

Farrim, the Amnian wizard outside launches a firebolt at Tark but the monk dodges that too, frustrating his attackers.

In the kitchens, the frustrated assassins calls are answered as his companion rushes back into the room to assist with the formidable Dwarf.  Now flanked, Gundren's position becomes far more tenuous.

JmJm rushes out into the foyer, donning the mysterious white glove and materializing an Arcane hand.  The massive hand smashes the Manor doors off its hinges in a shower of embers and splinters.  As the doors fly off their hinges, the Halfling Archer out front lets loose a volley into the Arcane hand, recognizing the threat it represents.  The magical arrows damage the hand greatly, but it persists.

In the kitchens, two more arrows fly in, one going wide but the other cutting a thing line along the Dwarf's chin.

Back in the foyer, Cirrus has two Zombies in his face.  He reaches out and blasts both with Eldritch energy, throwing them back against the stairs.  Surprisingly, both stand up again, showing little damage.

The raging battle in the Ballroom continues with Gneiss exchanging a flurry of blows against the two assassins, giving as good as he's getting.

Out front, Tark grips his staff and enacts its magic.  Flying, he launches himself up at the Red Robed creature.  He calls out to the creature, asking who or what it is and the cold voice - unmistakably Cercei but strangely modulated, responds.  It says that it knows Tark, that he should "feel" his family as it consumed them to awaken, so long ago.  In a rage, Tark unleashes a flurry of blows against the creature, shocking it with his brutality.

Buumi and Ernst rush to engage the zombies that smashed into the stairs, as they do though, two more assassins rush down the steps above them, leaping over the Paladin and his brother to flank them and strike vicious blows against both of them.  Both Ernst and Buumi land heavy hits on the corpses of Marta and Georg, both zombies starting to show some serious damage as Buumi's aura heals his brother.

In the Kitchens, Gundren realizes the predicament he's in and rips a diamond from his helmet, crushing it and releasing its magic as a Prismatic Spray erupts from his hands.  As each beam cascades over the enemies he faces, they are burned and electrocuted badly as Gwen continues her assault on the Assassin he faces.

Out front, Salama mutters a prayer of healing as she backs away from the arcane hand, healing energy washing over herself and Farrim.

Doc B skitters out from the burning building, past the Arcane hand and calls up to the storm above.  Staff and paws raised high, he brings a massive bolt of lightening crackling down, arcing into the Red Robed Creature, Priest and Wizard, fouling their concentration.

Fey rushes to the side, noting the assassins Misty step back from combat, both reaching for their necklaces of fireballs. Fey calls on his magic and enacts a Mirror image.

The burning house is quickly filling with smoke and the group begins to cough, though not enough to impede or harm them.

The two assassins in the Ballroom hurl their necklaces, both detonating and badly burning Gneiss and Fey, both looking unsteady on their feet. Chani manages to dodge out of the way of the blasts.

Li Xian laughs and rushes into combat with Patches, slashing out with his flint blade, the same blade he used to murder Tark's family.  Patches takes several wicked hits and drops a smoke bomb at her feet, obscuring the area.

Calling upon her Dark Elf heritage, she Faerie Fire's Li Xian and the two assassins on her before retaliating.  Ducking underneath a blow from Li she calls upon the magic of her celestial weapon and Strikes all three attackers with a flurry of teleportation attacks.

She then backs up into a corner, but as she does the door behind her flies open and one of the assassins from earlier emerges, its gaseous form dissipating.

Flying in the air above the battle, the Red Robed creature tries desperately to get away from the enraged monk, casting a dispel with no effect and then unleashing a psychic scream which the monk shakes off.

Just as Tark flies back in to strike the entity, his Flight is dispelled by the wizard below and he falls to the ground.

Rushing past his arcane hand, out front JmJm moves in to engage the Half Orc Cleric, his Inkblade slashing.  He scores a wicked hit against the Cleric and his sword erupts in darkness, surrounding him with inky energy.  He calls on the arcane hand to fly forward and grab Farrim, the wizard who begins to be crushed by it.

Doc B, hunkered down by the front of the building calls upon the storm again, another blast of lighting descending and striking his enemies.

In the manor, Patches is attacked by another assassin, congealing out of mist and is forced back on the defensive just as Gundren is assaulted from behind, still flanked by assassins himself.

Gundren spots the halfling archer outside rush from combat, at least she wont be shooting at him anymore...

Floating from the smoke cloud dropped by Patches and engulfed in purple flames, Li Xian flies across the foyer to engage Cirrus, flint knife flashing out to cut at the warlock.

With the massive Oni up in his face, Cirrus calls upon Selune and unleashes an explosion of psychic static, glowing needles stabbing into the minds of his enemies and confusing them.  It hits Li and several of the attacking assassins as they move to surround him.

Outside, Dellig the halfling archer fires at the Arcane hand again and rushes away from Tark who just landed nearby. 

Tark lets the archer flee and he moves in to assist JmJm in flanking the Cleric, striking her with a flurry of blows and stunning her. 

In the dining hall, Gneiss rushes forward with his lightning halberd and cleaves down one of the assassins, the other turns in shock as his companion is hacked apart.

As Gneiss finishes the assassin and quaffs a potion, Buumi appears in a flash, having Thunderstepped from his terrible position in the Foyer, bringing a wounded Ernst with him, the Aura doing what it can to keep his brother up.  Back on the stairs, a thunderclap of energy detonates, tearing at the two zombies and assassins.  Both zombies are looking tattered and broken, only on their feet due to the foul magic animating them.

Chani sees how injured Fey is looking and with the arrival of two more allies, thinks that support is better than attacking and rushes forward, giving a potion of healing and flying to Fey who starts to float up by the ceiling with his mirror images.

As she rushes by the door, her one time companion; Xor calls out to her and Gneiss, telling them to assist in the attack.  The two amnians spit, swearing they would never be a part of such an attack, especially on responsible for killing so many civilians.

In the kitchens, Gundren is looking very worse for wear, but so are the assassins attacking him. The Dwarf rips a ruby from his helm and throws it outside, creating a circle of roaring flame to bite at the attacking assassin and the veterans outside who cry out in pain. The trapped men try to rush through the wall of fire, but are overwhelmed by the blaze and burned to ash and Gundren shoves the assassin facing him into the wall of fire.

The assassins in the Foyer spread out, their targets having escaped or moved away, two rush to the Ballroom Doors as another misty steps behind Cirrus.

Combat rages throughout the manor, the house burning and smoke clogging the air.  Across the city, fires continue to burn and the massive red dragon, larger than Rahadin, burns and smashes ships in the harbor.  Flashes can be seen over by the keep as another battle rages there.

The assassins in the house are looking worse for wear, but so is the party as the battle continues.  

The wounds on Li Xian begin to close as he regenerates and the Red Robed creature flies high above the battle, launching more of its burning orbs into the fray...
