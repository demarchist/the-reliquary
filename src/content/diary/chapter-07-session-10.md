**A Chat, A Stroll and The Long House**

The party stands there looking at the corpse of Strigu, the Warlock of Ceregorach, laying still at the feet of Cirrus.

Moving out from the back room, Buumi and Jake appear, with Jake looking bleary and yawning from just waking up.

Galen sends a man to escort Jake from the building and to safety.

He turns to his other men and has them secure the perimeter and begin getting personnel back into the building.  He sits at a table and has a pitcher of wine and cheese board brought out to him and invites the group to join him.

Cirrus moves over to the semi-decapitated head of the Warlock and pulls out a knife and reaches for it.  Buumi looks on concerned and asks what he's doing.

Cirrus begins to cut an eye from the dead warlock and Buumi rushes forward to restrain the warlock.

Cirrus is squirrely enough to get free and finish cutting the eye out, securing the grisly trophy.

Cirrus then explains that’s exactly what it is, a trophy to inspire fear in the Warlocks he has been tasked with hunting.

Everyone looks at one another, concern evident, but Cirrus sees a connection between the loss of his own eyes and the quest from Selune.

Asking enthusiastically for a way to preserve the eye, Cirrus rushes out into the night in the direction of the Protector's Enclave to find a priest to preserve the eye…Buumi rushes to follow, apologizing to Galen.

Looking on amused, Galen sips his wine and gestures for the others to sit with him.  Patches slinks over and takes a glass, smelling the sweet wine within and noting its expensive taste.  And not detecting any hints of poison.  She takes a drink.

Gundren clomps over and takes a seat, chowing down on handfuls of cheese.  Tark slips in beside him and the two of them begin doing terrible damage to the platter of food.

Fey sits, but pulls out his spellbook, determined to identify a curious blue pearl they found on the corpse of the Warlock (A Pearl of Power).

Galen begins to chat with Patches, Fey, Tark and Gundren, mentioning the cost of repairs for the place and that he is a little "upset" that the battle with the Red Grin Killer went down in his establishment.  Patches slips him a note, asking for some supplies and Galen reads it.  Turning to Patches, he focuses on the group repaying him for damages (he is in fact asking for payment from Patches for the supplies).  

Fey is taken aback by the mans "faulty" logic until it dawns on him that there may be more to this favor and listens.

Galen tells them that the slavers killed in the Red Belt are only a part of the problem and that the people were being taken to the docks to board a boat to be sold in other markets.  He has little information      as the opposing "Guild" was very good at not being followed.

Galen also brings up local events, asking some questions about the Council and what the group is wrapped up in and gets some information (not a ton).

As a thank you for saving Jake, killing the Red Grin Killer and taking on the "favor" of finishing the job with the Slavers, Galen tells the group that there is a private room for them in The Long House, an establishment in the Protector's Enclave as he cannot put them up in a half burned Inn.

Galen thanks them for their time and bids them good night.

As the group goes to leave, Galen leans in and tells Gundren that The Pit, over in the Tower District will be much more up Gundren's Alley and the burley Dwarf decides he needs some "me time" and takes Galen up on the offer.

As they go to leave, Gundren mentions the meetup with Lady Faye at noon at the docks.

Gundren and Gwen head off on their own, deciding to meet up at Buumi's estate the next day.

Heading out into the city, the remaining group calls up a summoned mount with Fey riding and creating strange additions for extra seating.

They head off toward the Protector's Enclave and The Long House.

After a good twenty minutes, they realize they will have to ask for directions and look out for City Guard.

Finding a group of Lathandarian Acolytes working for the Guard, Fey inquires and finds out it’s a quiet night, and indeed Crime in the City is suspiciously quiet, what with the Council going on.

They get directions to The Long House and head off to find it, now knowing what to look for.

  

Meanwhile, Buumi has followed Cirrus, chatting with the Warlock about Morals and Ethics.

Cirrus listens but is adamant that he must do this.

Buumi gets more distressed, buying a shoe they can hide the eye in and filling it with liquor and plopping the bloody thing in.

Buumi is thinking this is far too vile and makes his case to Cirrus.

Cirrus mulls it over as the group heads deep into the Protector's Enclave.

The spell Flesh to Stone is mentioned and Buumi perks up, noting that thinking about the eye as a stone talisman is much more digestible than being flesh.

Cirrus snaps his fingers, remembering Modenkainen is in town and summons a tiny Cirrus messenger.

Cirrus drafts a quick note and has the tiny messenger send it.

A few minutes later, Cirrus stops, hearing the voice of Mordenkainen in his head.

Mordenkainen is happy to transform the eye of a monster to stone and greets Cirrus, remembering the group well.  Knowing the group would be in the city, he invites them to the castle to meet with him and some city officials the next day at Sunset for dinner.

Cirrus agrees whole heartedly and informs Buumi of their impending meeting with Mordenkainen, Archmage Dilly Griplim and Lord Dagult Neverember.

Cirrus and Buumi are discussing this just as they hear the clip-clopping of hooves and the voices of their friends and they look up to see the rest of the party (sans Gundren).

The group greets one another, are informed about Mordenkainen (much to Fey's dislike) and then head off to the nearby Long House, marked by a green door with a golden lion Knocker.  The door is the only give away that this marble structure is not a temple or private residence.

They knock and the door swings in under its own power…

  

Looking inside, they are greeted with a beautiful sight of a marble room with plush seating around a fountain with rose petals floating in the water.  Warmth blows out into the chill night air and the group all head into the inviting place.  Ahead of them is a rich hardwood counter and a middle aged human woman in a beautiful white silk gown, with elegant hair and sharp features.  She watches the group with steel colored eyes, a slight smile on her lips.

The woman asks that everyone remove their shoes and then asks what the group is doing there.

Buumi, Tark and Patches all dip their feet into the warm water of the fountain.  It is gloriously refreshing

The group introduces themselves and mention they want a room.

She says they are fully occupied, until the group mentions Galen.

She smiles, closing her book and invites the group to follow.

The woman - Rei, begins explaining the Spa treatments and describing the place.  As the group passes the main mineral pool and adjunct pools, Rei mentions that the suite they are going to has a smaller version.

Leading them deep into the structure, Rei arrives at a black door with silver trim and places her hand on the door.  It unlocks and swings inward revealing a kingly suite.

With a large bubbling mineral pool in the center, four adjunct pools around that with special liquids, plush couches, recessed cushioned areas, a fire place, sauna and two king-sized rooms off this main chamber.  The marble gleams and the furniture's rich hardwood reflects the light cast by floating crystal chandeliers.

Rei gestures to the desk where a menu is located as well as a crystal to contact the staff should any company, refreshment or "pick-me-ups" be required.  Laundry can be placed outside the door and it will be taken care of.

The group thanks Rei and begin to go about pampering themselves.

Patches immediately heads into a room, claims it and gets changed, then heads into the Steam Room to meditate.

When in there, she summons the mercury of Eclipse and focuses on it, attempting to enter a Reverie while maintaining the swirling ball of enchanted metal.

Outside, everyone else strips and gets into the large bubbling mineral pool, cleaning themselves off and relaxing.

Tark puts all the washing outside the door, pestering Patches for her laundry before grabbing it.

Cirrus uses the crystal and calls in for a "Pick-Me-Up".

Presented with an array of drugs, Cirrus picks the Kestrel-White, an inhaled powder.

Patches shows up at this point in a thick bath gown and grabs the Halfling leaf from the platter and begins to smoke.

Buumi has passed out in the recessed cushions by this point and Tark has lazily joined him.

Cirrus is having the time of his life though, sketching a tower idea, pacing back and forth completely naked and completely amped up.

Fey watches on amused and studies his books.

Eventually, Cirrus winds down and Fey enters his own reverie.

Cirrus begins hopping back and forth from pool to pool, relaxing.

During one such rest, he closes his eyes.  Through the lids, even with his strange moonlight-sight, he sees brightness.

Cirrus opens his eyes and sees a shining silver light, within which he can make out an obscure female figure.  Selune.

Cirrus looks in awe as the figure bends down and brushes his face with her hand.  Immediately, four new teeth grow into the gums of his mouth.  Cirrus gains 10lbs of muscle weight, his hair grows in less patchy and his blemishes heal slightly.  He looks rejuvenated…somewhat.

Cirrus gasps in awe and then professes his faith for her.  He mentions the eye as a trophy for her and senses a little confusion and revulsion for the trophy.

Cirrus blinks and the vision ends, leaving the Warlock grinning wildly and thinking about his path.
  

**Ladye Faye and her "Guest"**

The morning rolls around to midday and the group is finally all awake.

Cirrus wraps up a morning massage and then rounds the group up to leave and head to the docks to meet with Lady Faye for midday.

Realizing that the time is almost upon them, the group gets their cleaned clothes and heads out into the streets from The Long House.

Calling a carriage, the group piles in and make their way to the docks themselves.

Making quick time, they head down the embankment from The protector's Enclave to the water and the Docks themselves.

Nearing the Wharfs, they ask the carriage driver to inquire about* The Bearded Lass *II, the ship they are looking for.

After a couple of stops, the Carriage driver points out a 3 Master Caravel, painted blue.

The Carriage arrives at the Wharfs and the group gets out, seeing the Half-Orc Tara standing on the docks next to a large longboat, also blue.

Patches recognizes the description of Tara from Gundren and points it out.

Tark decides that he does not want to meet Lady Faye, he's still thinking about and mulling over the murders she had Patches commit in Sundabar.  He needs time to think and remains behind, walking the docks.

The group thanks the carriage driver (already paid for by the Long House).

They head over to Tara, Patches Rockie-talkying to Gundren, waking the slumbering Dwarf, and telling him of their meeting and their plan to stop by The Keep to talk to Mordenkainen in the evening.

They greet Tara, taking note of the strange woman's attire (a druid) and laaaaaarge pet rat.  Hopping into the boat, Tara takes up the oars and begins rowing out to the ship.

The docks are busy, with rowboats and smaller ships moving to and fro, a large amount of cargo and people being transferred, even in winter.

Arriving at The Bearded Lass through ice-less waters (yay volcanoes!), a rope net is lowered down to let the group climb aboard.

Buumi, Fey and Patches all climb. Buumi pulls himself over without effort, Patches flips over the railing onto the deck, and Fey rolls over the railing to land with a thump on the deck.

Cirrus meanwhile, levitates up above the railing, hanging there until Buumi notices and pulls him in with his Mage-Hand.

A young sailor mocks Fey as the Wizard rises to his feet, a little glum.

Tara ties up the boat and climbs aboard, telling Cpt. Dink she did her job and retiring to her hammock amongst the rigging.

Dink descends from the poop deck and greets the group, accepting introductions and motioning toward the captains cabins.

Dink mentions that Lady Faye has taken his cabin for the trip and she's very excited to see them all again.

Dink opens the door to the cabin and the group heads inside the dimly lit, yet lavish chamber.

Inside, they see a large desk set up with plush chairs around it, a screen divider at the back of the cabin, behind which is a bed, and numerous other small furnishings.

Sitting in one of the plush chairs is a middle-aged redheaded woman, stark beauty and elegant, bejeweled clothing. Lady Faye looks ever the wealthy noble.

She smiles at the group and beckons them over, extending a cream colored hand to each of them and remarking how glad she is that they all survived the battle at Baldur's Gate.  She and her associates were terribly worried. Her blue eyes scan over the group, taking them in.

An Elf woman walks around the divider.  She has long, blood red hair, light caramel skin and slightly glowing green eyes, wearing a crimson gown trimmed in gold and showing delicate shoulders.  Lady Faye introduces her as her new House Wizard - Lemerlais.

Fey is enchanted by this high elf woman.  Even more intriguing though is that he recognizes the name - the name of an elvish pirate queen from before the Spell-Plague over a century before.  He wonders why on earth Lemerlais would be working for Faye.

Cirrus moved in and kisses Lemerlais hand and greets her and she remarks that it is good to meet "Lord" Cirrus, already knowing the title.

The group sits and begin to talk, with Lady Faye and Lemerlais asking about Barovia and what has happened since they were in Baldur's Gate.

During the conversation, Patches keeps looking to the corner of the room, the shadows she sees there and a patch of suspiciously deeper shadow.  She flings a knife into the corner, right by the mans head and he lets out a little yelp of surprise.  

Lo'Dan strides from the shadows, a grin brightening up his dark purple features and stark white hair.

Buumi and Fey let out a groan, Fey even making some hostile hand movements.  Lo'Dan smiles and tries to look innocent.

He and Patches share a warm greeting (warm even for non-drow standards!).

Lo'Dan sits down next to lady Faye and she introduces him as her associated and liaison to Bregan D'Aerthe. This surprises Fey and Buumi who did not expect that connection with the lady of Baldur's Gate.

The group keeps discussing recent events.  The Council of Helm's Hold is brought up, as is the fact there is an Amnian delegation.

Lemerlais mentions that dark messengers have been intercepted, clearly from Zhengyi to leaders around the world, promising lichdom and undeath to anyone that would side with him. This is a powerful promise and is leading to some trust issues…

Lady Faye brings up that her archaeologists have been analyzing the vault the group discovered beneath Neverwinter (where they found the first fragment) and have cataloged it extensively.

Lo'Dan then leans in and mentions that their agents in the Underdark have found something similar - a mural depicting an artifact exactly the same as the one beneath Neverwinter - a potential lead on another fragment of The Last Word.  This mural is in ruins that match with the ones found out in the Troll Hills, where the Alhoon attacked them through the portal.

The group doesn’t see why its their problem though, Lady Faye should have those same agents do the dirty work.

Fey also expresses that they don’t need to fight, they can always flee, he is very close to being powerful enough and then they don’t need to save the world.  

Everyone sees his reasoning, but Lemerlais lays it out that Atropos and Orcus won't stop with one planet, and they will actively hunt down anyone they think powerful enough to stop them.  Fleeing would be temporary at best.

Sighing, Fey agrees and mentions that no one else should be told about the artifacts - the more people that know about them the harder it will be to find them and secure them.

The group asks where in the Underdark they would need to go.  Lady Faye tells them her agent will meet them in Gracksuluth.

Lady Faye, Lo'Dan and Lemerlais all look at one another before turning back to the group to say that no contact has been had with the Underdark since the Winter Solstice, clearly connected to the return of Zhengyi.

Understanding, the group agrees that after the Council of Helm's Hold, they will head beneath the surface of Faerun to head to Gracksuluth: the city of the Dueregar to meet Lady Faye's agents...
