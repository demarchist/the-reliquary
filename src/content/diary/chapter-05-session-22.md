## Departure

The group split into two teams. Mordenkainen, Stick, JmJm, Buumi, Ireena, Ezmerelda, Waldo the guardsman from Krezk, and the non-combatants would teleport in once the main party had infiltrated the castle — homing on Mordenkainen's sending stone. JmJm stood from his corner, Steven's putrefying corpse at his feet, and declared he wanted in on the final battle. Buumi pointed out that he could not climb the Pillarstone with one arm and agreed to wait with the second team.

Stick teleported the infiltration group — Patches, Cyrrus, Fëanon, Tark, Gundren, Gwen, and six wereravens — to a misty field outside Barovia Village. Stick wished the group luck, especially Patches, whose response to his flirting was immediate and final. With a sigh, the sentient staff teleported back to Mordenkainen.

## The Ruined Village

Lightning flashed with terrifying intensity. Castle Ravenloft was visible atop the twelve-hundred-foot Pillarstone, a vortex of dark energy and undead spirits swirling above. The group sent the wereravens to scout. Urwen and Danica returned to report that Barovia Village was deserted and destroyed.

The group walked through the ruins. Every building was a hollow, burned shell. Muddy cobblestones ran red with blood. Nothing was alive, but nothing was dead — the village was devoid of even corpses. An oppressive silence clung to the mist. Gundren spotted the glint of metal in a collapsed merchant shop. He and Patches found a charred lockbox, picked the lock, and pocketed a small amount of coin. Urwen gave them an incredulous look. The end of the world was nigh, but looting a burned house was still a high priority.

They crossed deserted farms and entered the Svalich woods. The wereravens scouted ahead and found nothing — every creature in the valley had been called to the castle. The group doubled their pace.

## The Pillarstone

The Pillarstone rose above them. A blistering curtain of lightning and a thousand-foot cliff stood between them and the cavern entrance. Patches studied the pattern of the bolts, timed her moment, and leapt through unscathed. She donned her climbing kit and began her free-climb, quickly finding her rhythm on the mossy, icy stones and ascending at a prodigious rate.

Cyrrus called upon his armour and transformed into a giant raven. Tark hugged the huge bird, then climbed onto its back and wrapped them both in shadow. Gwen went into the bag of holding — the mechanical lion did not need to breathe. Cyrrus picked up Fëanon and Gundren in his talons and dove through the lightning curtain with singed feathers. The wereravens followed, several taking painful hits but recovering. The massive raven circled the Pillarstone under concealment, rising swiftly to the cavern opening.

A massive bat-like creature swooped from the swirling mass above and shrieked — but failed to spot the obscured group as Cyrrus slipped into the guano-covered cavern. He deposited his cargo and looked down for Patches. After many minutes he spotted movement in a flash of light — the Drow, scaling the cliffside with ease. She looked up, saw the giant raven, sagged in her harness, and beckoned. Cyrrus dove. Patches detached her anchor and let herself fall — scooped up gently in his talons.

## The Black Pool

The deepening cavern was claustrophobic and dark. Patches led, the passage intimately familiar to her Underdark instincts. The tunnel ended in a small chamber: a stone chimney rising fifty feet above a still, black pool of fetid water. The place screamed predator.

Tark shadowstepped to the tunnel above and looked down at Patches — who stared back incredulously, holding the rope he was supposed to secure. He shadowstepped back, grabbed it, and realised he had no idea how to use a climbing anchor. Patches sighed, showed him, and sent him back up. The rope was set. Gundren climbed easily. Fëanon slipped — Cyrrus brushed his shoulder with levitation and the weightless wizard hand-walked up without effort. Cyrrus himself slipped next. Patches shot a securing web and Fëanon froze the pool solid in the same instant. The tension bled away and Cyrrus was hauled to the top. Gwen leapt up with ease, her mithril claws finding easy purchase.

## The Catacombs

The tunnel corkscrewed upward. Patches called a halt — ahead, a chasm full of spiderwebs and giant spiders. Fëanon suggested fire. They readied weapons and he sent a firebolt into the webbing. The flames drove the spiders straight into the waiting group. Arrows, bullets, and spells filled the tunnel. Urwen and Danica cut down anything that got close. Patches backed away, shuddering in revulsion. Gundren ripped a leg from a dead spider and began sucking out the flesh. Patches gagged.

At the top of the chasm, Patches found a hole in a man-made stone wall — the catacombs. The group squeezed through one at a time into the guano-coated crypts. Patches cleared the area, even checking Strahd's crypt for his ex-wives, and found nothing. They made their way to the teleportation brazier, Patches noting the flicker of purple torchlight ascending stairs away from them. Only one gemstone remained — the red one from their last visit. Fëanon cast it into the flame and the group was transported in a flash of crimson light to Strahd's study.

## The Study

The study was deserted, the hearth burning low. Fëanon contacted Mordenkainen — thirty minutes before the castle left. He cast the sending stone into the centre of the room. A sharp crack echoed and the beautiful oak table was crushed to splinters as everyone from Argynvost's sanctum appeared. Mordenkainen immediately raised a tiny hut for the non-combatants. The children, the mayor of Krezk, and the surviving villager climbed inside. Waldo refused, gripping his weapons — he would rather die on his feet. Chekhov asked Patches if he could fight too, but she told him to stay and protect the others. He and Mr. Pickles joined the children with Kitty and Aurora waiting just outside.

The group took stock: JmJm, Buumi, Cyrrus, Fëanon, Tark, Gundren, Gwen, Ireena, Ezmerelda, Mordenkainen, Stick, Waldo, Urwen, Danica, Herti, Gibra, Derik, and Kurt. Buumi now wielded the Ashbringer, returning Tark to his beloved staff. Ireena looked around the chamber, remembering it from a life long ago. Her gaze settled on her portrait above the fireplace — she recalled sitting for the painter as Tatyana. Her expression turned stony as she drew her sabre.

## The Scrying

Fëanon reached into his ring and wrestled its far-sight from the entity to scry through the castle's wards. He found Strahd in the desecrated chapel, facing the altar. The Fragment of the Last Word — a golden rectangle now glowing white-hot — floated above a white marble slab. Energy pulsed outward, each wave burning Strahd's flesh to bone before his vampiric regeneration restored him.

Fëanon moved the spell through the chapel doors and down the hall. Rahadin waited at a set of grand copper doors covered in bas-reliefs of dragons and knights. Light glowed from beneath the chapel door behind him. The Dusk Elf stood with eyes closed, utterly still, his armour gleaming and his scimitar sheathed.

The group decided to assault Rahadin while Strahd could not leave his spellcasting. JmJm wandered to a bookshelf, raised his ornate brooch, and the bookcase animated — eleven books soaring from its shelves as flapping scouts. The bard leapt atop his creation and tried to ride it through the door, had to dismount and shove it through, then remounted and led the charge down the hall with the party in pursuit.

They passed the statues lining the corridor — each face contorting in anguish with every flash of energy. One floor down, the bookcase could not fit through the doors. Mordenkainen cast Reduce without patience. In the throne room beyond, hundreds of hollow, soulless peasants stood motionless and unresponsive. The group pushed carefully through the press of bodies, knowing the mob would attack the moment fighting began. They set tripwires at the top of the stairs and greased the steps.

On the landing above the grand hall, the party looked at one another. Below waited Rahadin. JmJm's animated bookcase led the charge, a visual and physical barrier. The clatter was clearly audible. As they reached the ground floor, they saw a streak of darkness return to Rahadin — his shadow rejoining him. The Dusk Elf's sly smile shifted to surprise as he took in the size of the force arrayed against him.

By the gleaming copper doors, one of the beautiful dragon statues shifted. Stone flaked away in sheets as a young red dragon stepped down from its plinth.
