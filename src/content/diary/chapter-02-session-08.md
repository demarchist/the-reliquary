Surrounded by the aftermath of the attack, the group surveyed the carnage. Town guards and a knight arrived to debrief them. No other spellcasters had been spotted elsewhere in the city — the mage the group had killed was likely the leader. As the corpses were carted away, Patches managed to lift a satchel from the dead mage containing spell reagents and two spell scrolls.

## Moot's Gift

Moot approached and congratulated the group on a fine battle. He gifted his staff to Tark, then headed to the Keep to offer his assistance. Tark stared at the staff in wonder as Ysera chirped with happiness.

Kangaxx appeared and once again implored the group to head into the Chasm to find his missing friends. With the city placed on lockdown, citizens returned home and adventurers to their inns. Kangaxx tagged along as the group headed to the Moonstone Mask.

## Myria Brightlance

The inn was packed with patrons discussing the day's events. A wounded and weary Tark ordered "one of everything." The group's attention was caught by a female warrior elf sitting alone — other adventurers gave her a wide berth. She beckoned them over and introduced herself as Myria Brightlance, assigned to lead them into the Chasm the next morning.

JmJm charmed her while Patches antagonized her and Fëanon attempted, less successfully, to woo her. Myria paid the group half their promised gold from Lord Neverember — the investigation was now doubly urgent, as the cultists' tracks had been traced back to the Chasm. The group agreed to meet her at the temple district in the morning.

## Lo'Dan's Proposition

After Myria left, Tark ordered "one of everything" again, resulting in a massive feast at a single table. As the group ate, Raylen sat down, smiled warmly, and asked how their day had been. Then he mentioned they should follow him upstairs for the antidote. The implication sank in. Stomach pains suddenly became very noticeable, and the group became acutely aware of how much they wanted to kill Raylen.

Tark, however, had pains from sheer overeating — his belt had protected him from the poison. As Raylen headed upstairs, Buumi discreetly touched each member of the group, neutralizing the poison. They followed Raylen, Patches, Tark, and JmJm questioning every step and looking for an opening.

In the final room on the floor, Raylen ushered the group inside. JmJm turned to leave and was confronted by four Drow warriors who stepped from the walls and knocked him unconscious, dragging him inside. More Drow materialized, including Lo'Dan, leader of Bregan D'aerthe in the region. He welcomed the group warmly and chatted with Patches, telling her how much they all missed her.

Patches, furious about the poisoning, demanded a slap on Raylen. Laughing, Raylen accepted — only to discover her glove was poisoned. He fell paralyzed to the floor. Patches kicked him several times while the other Drow looked on in amusement.

Lo'Dan laid down two thousand gold and explained the situation. The Chasm contained an ancient ruined temple — Bregan D'aerthe's base of operations in the city. A week ago, Venomfang had flown to the bottom of the Chasm. At the same moment, a spell triggered, teleporting the Drow out and raising wards. Lo'Dan had been searching for Nezzan — their mage and supposed wardstone expert — only to discover Nezzan was a fraud who'd stolen the wardstone from the Rockseekers. Seeing the group's prowess and their possession of the wardstone, Lo'Dan wanted them to recover the base and find out what happened.

JmJm awoke, saw a big sack of gold, and immediately agreed. The Drow departed, leaving the paralyzed Raylen on the floor. The group tied a rope around his legs and hung him out the window, far above the ground.

## Preparations

In the Tavern of Doors, the group rested and prepared. During the night, Patches felt The Reaver's hunger gnawing at her soul — knowing it had to feed, she sacrificed one of the Tavern's goblins to the dagger. The next morning, JmJm noticed a goblin missing and demanded a search. Despite the efforts of Patches, Buumi, and Tark, no trace was found.

The group made a final supply run: half-plate +1, a Shield +1, eight greater healing potions, a Potion of Invulnerability, a Potion of Necrotic Resistance, several spells, and numerous poisons. The Rockseeker brothers crafted JmJm a special greatsword from his Spider Staff. Donning his new magical armor and armed with the two-handed sword, JmJm was ready. He also caught a glimpse of a clockwork lion the Rockseekers were working on.

## Into the Chasm

The group met Myria, who'd brought two companions: a gnome mage named Budder Glint and a human guard named Lester. The twelve-person column marched through the ruined section of the city, any monsters wisely staying clear of such a formidable force. After an hour, they found where the cultist tracks led — a wrecked tavern half-crumbled into the massive crevasse.

The descent began — switchbacks leading deeper into the Chasm. Doctor Breakfast spotted a large flock of nesting stirges and conjured a fog to obscure the group's passage, bypassing the blood-suckers. Further down, they had to drop to a lower ledge. JmJm backflipped down. Buumi landed with a solid thud. Lester rolled his ankle and pitched over the edge. Both Tark and Patches fired their web bracers — Tark missed, Patches snagged only a boot that pulled free. JmJm saved Lester's life at the last instant, catching him with webbing from his new blade.

Far down the Chasm walls now, the light barely reached them. Spider webs lay thick in every direction. Fëanon conjured four glowing orbs, and the group heard immediate skittering — things retreating from the light. On an impulse, Tark shot a gout of flame into the Chasm from his ring, burning away webbing and illuminating the darkness. The light revealed a horde of spiders making their way up, including the largest spider any of them had ever seen — larger than a wagon. The group prepared for battle.
