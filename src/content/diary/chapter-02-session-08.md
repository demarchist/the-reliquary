Surrounded by the aftermath of the attack on the festival, the group surveys the carnage.  While looking over the corpses, the town guard and a knight run up to debrief the group. Asking what happened in this encounter specifically, the guards note that no other spell users were noted throughout the city, the mage that attacked the group here must have been the leader.  The group asks about the attack and come to the conclusion that more must be going on.  As the corpses are carted away for inspection, Patches manages to lift a satchel off the dead mage containing spell reagents and two spell scrolls.

   Moot approaches and congratulates the group on a good fight, gifting his staff to Tark and then heading to the keep to offer his assistance.  Tark looks at the staff in wonder as Ysera chirps with happiness.

  The group is then approached by Kangaxx, the gold toothed mage from the Moonstone mask inn and once again implores the group to head to the chasm to find his missing friends. The guards place the city on lockdown and the citizens return to their homes and the adventurers return to their inns.  Kangaxx tags along with the group as they head back to the Moonstone Mask.

Upon arriving, they see that the inn is packed full of patrons all busily talking about the days events.  A wounded and weary Tark quickly finds a serving girl and order "one of everything".  The group has their attention caught by a female warrior elf sitting alone at a table, other adventurers giving her a wide berth and she beckons the group over.  Introducing herself as Myria Brightlance, she tells the group that she is there to lead them into the Chasm the next morning.  JmJm successfully attempts to get on her good side, despite Patches antagonizing the elf and Fey'Anon trying to woo her as well….less successfully.  Myria pays the group half their promised gold up front from Neverember to investigate the Chasm in regards to the Dragon - and now even more urgently as the cultists were tracked back to the Chasm as well.  The group must meet her the next morning in the temple district to head to the Chasm.  The group agrees and she takes her leave, but not before one more round of wooing and antagonizing from certain party members…

After she leaves, Tark orders "one of everything" again and ends up with a large feast placed at the single table.  After a few minutes of the group eating, Raylen the moon elf sits with the group and smiles warmly, asking how their day went and grinning at Patches.  The group mentions it was quite an interesting day and Raylen agrees, mentioning they should follow him upstairs for the antidote…the group takes a moment form that to sink in and suddenly become very aware of some stomach pains and just how much they want to kill Raylen right now…

Tark, however has pains simply because he ate so much, his belt protecting him from the effects of the poison.  As Raylen heads upstairs, Buumi discretely touches each member of the group, neutralizing the poison.  The group follows Raylen, with Tark, Patches and JmJm questioning every step and looking for an opening to get some revenge.

Coming to the final room on that floor of the Inn, Raylen opens the door and ushers the group inside, everyone but Doc B and JmJm enter - with JmJm turning to simply leave.  As JmJm turns he is confronted by four Drow Warriors who literally step out of the walls and knock him unconscious.  Doc B decides the room is the good place to be and enters, with the Drow dragging an unconscious JmJm in and plopping him in a chair. Seeing his teammate down, Tark gets riled up, his patience quickly evaporating.  More Drow step from the walls, including Lo'Dan, leader of Bregan D'aerthe in the area.  Lo'Dan welcomes the group warmly, mentioning how interesting their adventures have been, especially the dragon fight - to which the group replies they could show him first hand just how interesting they can be.  Laughing at the bravado, Lo'Dan chats with Patches, telling her how much they all miss her.  Pissed off at the attempted poisoning, Patches demands a slap on Raylen.  Laughing and thinking nothing of it Raylen accepts the hit, only to discover her glove was poisoned and becomes paralyzed falling to the floor.  Patches then proceeds to kick him a few times for fun while the other Drow look on in amusement.

Lo'Dan throws down two thousand gold and offers to pay the group to head into the Chasm to investigate a ruined ancient temple - Bregans base of operations in the city until a week or so ago when the Green Dragon Venomfang flew to the bottom of the Chasm.  At the same moment the dragon got to the ruins, some spell went off, teleporting the Drow out and raising wards.  The reason Lo'Dan was in the spellforge looking for Nezzan was to get access back into the ruins as Nezzan was their mage and supposed expert on wardstones - only to dicover Nezzan was a fraud having stolen the wardstone from the Rockseeker brothers.  Seeing the prowess of the group and that they still have the wardstone and magical expertise, Lo'Dan wants the group to go and recover their base of operations and find out what happened.

Coming back to the waking world, JmJm sees a big sack of gold and immediately agrees, as does the rest of the group - albeit somewhat reluctantly.  A deal set, the Drow leave but Raylen remains behind, paralyzed on the floor.  The group advance on the poor elf, tying a rope around his legs and hanging him out of the window, far, far above the ground.

Heading to their room and then into the ToD, the group rests up fully healing and preparing for the next day. Initially, the group does not allow Kangaxx into the box, forcing him to rest in the room.  During the night Patches feels the hunger of her Dagger growing and gnawing at her own soul - knowing it has to feed and soon, Patches feeds one of the box Goblins to the dagger to placate it.  The next morning, the group wakes up to prepare breakfast, sending out a bountiful feast to Kangaxx.  JmJm notes however the absence of one of his beloved Goblins and immediately suspects some foul play.  Demanding a Goblin hunt and following Patches around, the group finds nothing, even with Patches, Buumi and Tark trying their hardest to find the little Goblin.  Kangaxx at this point is invited into the box to participate but becomes exasperated at the endeavor.  Eventually, with the deadline to meet Myria looming, the group gives up and quickly heads to the markets and remaining festival stalls and tents to buy supplies. The group buys Half-plate +1, a Shield +1, 8 greater healing potions, 1 potion of invulnerability, 1 potion of necrotic resistance, several new spells and numerous poisons while at the same time having the Rockseeker brothers craft a special greatsword for JmJm out of his Spider-staff.  Donning his new magical armor and armed with a special two handed sword, JmJm is ready for battle.  He also manages to catch a glimpse of a clockwork lion the Rockseeker brothers were working on.

Fully supplied and ready to adventure, the group heads out to meet Myria.  Crossing the deserted streets of the city, the group encounters only guards, which stay out of the groups way as their purpose is known.  The group meets up with Myria who herself has brought two companions, a Gnome mage named Budder Glint and a human guard named Lester.  The group heads through the gates into the ruined section of the city, a marching order formed out of the now twelve person group.  They march through the ruins with out issue, any monsters deciding to stay out of the path of such a large and formidable force.  After an hour or so, the group finds their way to where the cultists tracks led - a wrecked tavern half crumbled into the massive crevasse splitting the ruins of the city.  The group decides to waste no time and find the trail, descending down switchbacks heading deeper and deeper into the Chasm.  The going is treacherous, with the occasional slip but no falls.  After some traveling the group is made aware of a large flock of nesting Stirges - Doc B pointing them out.  Not wanting a battle, Doc B conjures up a magical fog to obscure the group and they manage to bypass the nasty little blood suckers.  Some time later, the group has to drop to a lower ledge.  JmJm shows up backflipping down there and Buumi lands with a solid and impressive thud.  Lester however is less lucky and rolls his ankle landing, pitching sidelong over the Chasm edge. Both Tark and Patches shoot their web bracers to catch him, Tark missing and Patches snagging a boot which simple pulls free of his foot. As Lester careens down into the abyss, JmJm - with a flourish, enacts the magic of his new blade causing webbing to form catching Lester and saving his life. The group pulls Lester back to safety, expecting some manner of repayment for the saving of his life.

Now very far down the Chasm walls, the light barely reaches the group.  They notice the air becoming stiller and webbing laying thick about them.  Noting the dark, Fey'Anon produces four glowing orbs of light that float about - the group hearing immediate skittering from things hiding from the light. JmJm hears some skittering and whispers of "fooooood".  Coming to a landing with a tunnel leading out back and switchbacks continuing downwards, the group takes a moment to collect themselves, with some looking over the edge of the Chasm and others investigating the tunnel at the back of this small "cave".  They notice that the spider webs are so thick about that it's hard to move without running into them.  On an impulse, Tark enacts the magic of his ring, shooting a gout of flame into the chasm, burning webbing away and illuminating the area.  With the light from Fey'Anon and the webbing burning away, the group clearly sees a horde of Spiders making their way up towards them, including the largest spider any of them has ever seen - larger than a wagon.  The group prepares for battle.
