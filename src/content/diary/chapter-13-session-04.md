The group spends some time deciding on their course of action.

The group talks things over with Camea, the Shaman of her halfling people

With some questioning about the nature of this Hohonu, Feanon decides he needs more information

The wizard uses his arcane mastery to pull information from the fabric of reality and gleans a great deal of information on Hohonu and his place of power.

Hohonu is an ancient Dragon, from when this world was young and the gods still walked the earth engaged in conflict.

He has been imprisoned for eons and now, with the weakening of the world's barriers, Vecna may be seeking an ally.

Long ago Hohonu was sealed within a Greater Magic Cirlce, contained within a powerful Antipathy spell, with something else chaining the great beast away within the circle.

It is likely that the Halflings are weakening the Greater Circle with human sacrifice and he suspects the Antipathy spell is long gone. 

The group makes a decision to continue toward Aina Pulu and do what they can to stop the ongoing sacrifices, to stall the resurrection of this demigod dragon.

They will do what they can to shore up the magic sealing Hohonu and then continue on to the Factory.

They intend to return with their own dragon allies, and put down this Hohonu before he can meet up with Zalaam/Vecna.

Talking with Camea, the group realizes what the Haflings in her party have risked to be here and offer them sanctuary at The Golden Tower.

Camera thanks them, but refuses for now.

They continue on their course, heading through the swamp.

After the better part of the morning, the days progress looks bleak as a storm begins to darken the western horizon.

The Highstorm begins to rip across the swamp, uprooting trees and hurling debris

The group is forced to look for shelter and they spot some ancient ruins, great blocks of stone jutting from the swamp.

They are warned by Camea that her people avoid those places, as they are haunted by the ancient Saurian ghosts of the marsh 

The group takes heed, but the storm is proving to be a bad one.

The group heads in anyways, interested from a historical perspective.

The exterior is made of ancient stone blocks, overgrown by centuries of vines and jungle

a monolithic door frame leads to a hall leading steadily downward.

They enter the brief tunnel and find themselves in a great hall of stone with their breath clearly visible in great plumes.

Indeed, the group finds themselves quickly shivering and Feanon confirms that this is an unnatural cold and ancient frozen corpses can be seen scattered around.

The group moves in, curious and they see that many of the corpses are the mummified remains of Saurians and Elves, though some strange conical corpses with gaping maws and four arms can be seen surrounded by the dead.

The aberrations are identified by Feanon as Phaerimm, the great Aberration enemies of seemingly all creation.  

Phaerimm have not been seen in millenia, but history shows that wherever they appear, all must band together to fight them or be consumed.

A glimmer of light gets the group's attention and they see ghostly apparitions moving about the chamber, long elegant serpentine forms of ancient saurians intermingled with the smaller forms of elves.  Their armor made of gleaming metal and adorned in feathers, they all wield firelances and elegant curving swords.

The elven commander gives a rousing speech, talking about battling some great foe (the group assumes the Phaerimm) and giving their lives for the empire.

The commander’s men cheer, and the ghostly apparitions subside.

Buumi sees that the commander turned deeper into the ancient ruins and patrols to the back of the great hall of this place.

He is not caught unawares then as a Skeletal force of Saurians and Strange ghostly aberrations come shambling and floating out of the tunnel to attack.

The group quickly rallies to Buumi’s cry of alarm and the battle is on.

The skeletal foes are sheathed in icey energies that as the group strikes, freezes attacker

The group finds that even the ghosts of the dreaded Phaerimm are formidable, capable of rerouting and consuming magic.

The battle is surprisingly fierce but ultimately the group destroys all of the attacking undead.

As the last moments of the battle rage though, an errant spell tears open a rift and three great serpentine beasts fly through.

Great feathered and crystalline Quetzacoatalus fill the chamber with glittering light dancing off the frosty surfaces.

The group finds themselves in the great hall of a long dead fortress, facing great fae creatures while the ancient inhabitants of this dark place seem to be reliving their final moments…
