**Sloodublop**

Sloodublop lies in ruins and the streets are drenched in blood, but the demonic ritual has been stopped.

The group ambles over to the somewhat decrepit Duergar steamship, JmJm already leaning on the railing and waving for everyone to come aboard.

Back in the main plaza, by the ruined shrine to the Deep father, Shuushar and Ploop begin to talk, the last three cultists tied up and unconscious at their feet.

Shuushar leaves the gathering of his people and follows the group over to the Duergar ship. 

Tark asks the Kuo-Toa if he intends to stay, he does.

Still wondering about Shuushars meditative techniques, the older Kuo-Toa responds that out in the darkness, with the absolute silence of the Darklake, he found enlightenment and freedom from madness.

Tark resolves himself to find a quiet spot on the Darklake to meditate.

Meanwhile, on the ship, Hemeth has come up from below deck and begun to converse with the group, albeit with some difficulty.

Patches and Tark understand the Duergar fine in Undercommon, but his Deep Dwarvish takes some getting used to for Gundren.

Hemeth mentions Gundren as a Blood traitor and seems to show some veiled hostility toward the Surface Dwarf.

Eventually though, a good system of translation is worked out and they begin to converse.

As the discussion is beginning, a large furry form gallops up from the hold below, but stops short seeing a number of new people.

The massive (Great Dane sized) baby Steeder (arachnid) stops and looks over the group with its eight glittering eyes.

Patches backs away quickly, terrified of the spider, but quickly recognizes it as the Duergar beast of burden.  She explains this to the group and indeed, the others had not sensed hostility from the beast.

Hemeth introduces his "little girl" Alli, the baby Steeder he purchased and considers an investment for a future trade route.

Hemeth is a Weapons trader and came to Sloodublop a few days ago seeking to make some quick profit, selling weapons to both sides.

Things went south and he was captured and to be sacrificed.  

His Derro servant Inlebilly was killed earlier that day.

Patches notes that the dagger she gave to Hemeth (venomous dagger) is extremely valuable and the Dwarf agrees, thinking it fitting payment to ferry them across the Darklake to the Dark Iron City of Gracksuluth

Not wanting to tarry for too long, the group prepares to leave, bidding farewell to Shuushar.

Worried about a demonic insurrection behind them, Patches climbs into one of the paddle-steamer wheel-houses and lines up a shot with her heavy crossbow on the form of Blop, Ploop's cult leading daughter, and fires.

Climbing back up the other side of the boat, only Doc B notices the Drow climbing up and thinks it rather odd...

Stool shifts a little in Patches pack, content to be ferried around and none the wiser.

Meanwhile, the group has done a quick inspection of the ship and noted a few things - the hold is completely empty, there is a single locked cabin (captains cabin) and the only other room is the Engine room.

Noting the empty hold, Hemeth asks for assistance in retrieving his goods from the Kuo-Toa and the group takes the next hour ferrying the heavy crates back into the hold of the ship.

As they move the crates of "decent" weapons, they come across one smaller Zurkhwood crate.

Tark smells something familiar and the group ask Hemeth whats inside.

The Duergar does not answer at first.

When the crate is safely in the hold, the group asks again and they notice the Duergar getting nervous.

They open the crate and find pounds of Halfling leaf and Orcish Rudgrub along with a dozen art pieces and decorative clothing pieces.

Contraband for Duergar.

Patches explains the Duergar aversion to art.

the Drow pockets quite a bit of the Halfling Leaf and Hemeth doesn't protest as the group says they will assist in his smuggling

During this conversation, the group notes a few interesting things about Hemeth - He's wearing beard extensions and is MUCH younger than he appears.

Indeed, after this is figured out, the Duergar removes the fake beard, showing whiskers shorter than Tark even.  

Hemeth is only in his mid twenties - a child for a Dwarf but is very close to being clanless, he needs to make a name for himself as a trader or become outcast.

He explains that profit and business success is everything to the Duergar and that punishment is doled out in two flavors in Duergar society - death, or fines.

He mentions that he has a few leads on the way to Gracksuluth that could help him out significantly - a rumored Iron deposit and a scrap of a map that he paid a wizard to scry on for him.

The group agrees they can check these things out as long as they are on the way.

Hemeth swears that using the Duergar Locks, he can have them to Gracksuluth in six days, including the detours.

Now REALLY wanting to get underway, the conversation turns to Snorbul.

Realizing Snorbul is only tangentially with the group, Hemeth pulls out his dagger and decides to go and enslave the Deep Gnome.

Hemeth heads up to the deck and most of the group follows, though Tark and Gundren get distracted. 

Tark looks around the engine room, noting an old and dirty bed, chamber pot, large boiler and huge barrel of coal.

examining the dirty bed, Tark finds a journal underneath and hidden underneath a loose plank.

"reading" it proves to be complicated as it appears to be mostly pictures, crudely drawn - The Derro Servant's journal.

Deciphering it, Tark gets a sense of a life of travel and trade.  But one that has not gone well.

Gundren enters the engine room and starts to take notes on the mechanics, nodding at the obviousness of the design.  

He does find some interesting Rune-craft though and begins to take notes on the sound and heat muffling nature of the Runes.

Meanwhile, Tark heads back upstairs, confused about the piles of "Dirty Rocks" in the engine room.

The use of the "dirty rocks" is explained to Tark just as the group is deciding what to do about the Deep Gnome Snorbul. 

The conversation goes pretty well considering it starts with slavery, but ends with Hemeth taking Snorbul on as the engineer for the boiler room.

Not sure what the gnome is lying about though, just that he's a bit shifty, the group decide to question Snorbul and get on his case a little bit.

With a bit of pressure, he spills his guts - he's not wealthy, but he has some leads on treasure in some of the older and non-settled parts of Blingdenstone if the group gets him there, he'll give them some goodies.

A little off put, Tark swears that no one will shovel more coal than him and goes back to the engine room, determined to out-do Snorbul (who does not complain).

Finally, the ship shudders to life as the boiler is fed a steady supply of coal, and the wheeled Duergar ship begins to churn the waters, bellowing black smoke and heading out into the darkness of the underground lake.

**Sailing the Darklake**

**​**The ship steams on ahead, quickly putting the phosphorescent lights of Sloodublop in the distance, the noise of the ship muffled by it's magical construction.

Gundren goes around the ship, doing what he can to fix the old bucket of bolts that has seen better decades.  Coming across the deck cannon, the old Artificer notes the barrel is cracked and goes about mending it.

Before long, more of the group has gathered as they try to figure out if they have any powder and shot.

Patches pulls a dozen pounds of black powder from her backpack, already packed in small charges and asks if they will work.

The group looks at the Drow infiltrator, flabbergasted that she was carrying around so many explosives.

Patches just shrugs.

With the black powder, and hundreds of ball-bearings provided by Gundren, they cobble together six good shots for the aft gun.

The first day of travel goes by quite uneventfully and compared to traversing the tunnels of the Underdark, it is far more relaxing.

Hemeth has the group on lookout at the front of the ship to call out any stalacmites or hidden rocks, but Hemeth is a good pilot despite his age and everything is avoided easily.

The group takes the day for some much needed rest. 

Fey takes the time to dig through Strahd's spellbook, Patches makes bombs, Tark shovels coal with Snorbul (who goes on about the Duergar's terrible mining practices), Cirrus takes watch, JmJm poses on the bow of the ship and Doc decides to try and look into the water for the local wildlife.

After eight hours of solid progress across the dark waters, Hemeth announces he needs a rest.

Tark takes the wheel and Cirrus takes watch.  Between the two of them, they don't hit any rocks and they keep their heading pretty straight.

The only thing of note is that Tark does see a small Kuo-Toa raft hiding behind a rock pillar, avoiding the Duergar Steamboat.

The ship continues on through the "night", Hemeth taking the wheel back after a few hours of rest.

The sleeping arrangements are less than stellar, and the group decides they need a little proper relaxation.

They find a place to moor the ship and Fey'Anon casts his Magnificent mansion spell, Snorbul and Hemeth joining the group in the luxury of the extra dimensional pocket

 Once again being truly astounded by the groups ability.

The group takes turns watching the boat in the Material Plane while the others relax.

Over the night, Tark and Patches both note flickering of Bio-luminescence and investigate, finding schools of fish beneath the surface, flitting around rock formations.

Realizing the danger of straying away from the group, alone, no one investigates further and the night is uneventful.

The second day of travel begins and with the group on lookout and assisting Hemeth, the early day is rather boring, though some phosphorescent fungi and fish break up the dark monotony.

Later, Hemeth remarks that they are getting close to the location of the first detour; the map fragment.

After an hour or so, a massive stone pillar looms out of the darkness.  Hemeth circles it and finds a good place to moor.

The group disembarks to look around for...something.

Twenty minutes goes by.

Gundren and Fey find a piece of stonework, inlaid with ancient bronze - reminiscent of old Netherese, but there is no intact stonework around the base of this stone pillar.

On a hunch, Patches begins to climb the pillar, and sure enough, she notes ancient architecture wedged in a crack along the ceiling of the cavern.

Patches anchors herself with her climbing kit and Rockie Talkies down to the group, dropping a rope, although even the length of rope wont quite reach the cavern floor.

Fey, Gundren and Patches all head up to investigate the ancient ruins in the ceiling while everyone else remains behind to guard the ship.

Twenty minutes goes by, Tark noting a strange amphibious looking creature paddling a small raft through the darkness and Cirrus espousing the virtues of the Moon goddess to two Underdark dwellers who have never seen the moon.

Doc B then remembers that he can get Tark and Cirrus up to the rope, and the ruins easily.  He shapes the earth to create a ramp and tells his companions that he and JmJm will secure the boat and they should go help the others.

They agree and climb up to the ceiling and the ancient ruins contained there.

**The Tomb**

​The ancient ruins  are unsettling and off-kilter, held aloft in the ceiling of the cavern by being wedged there from some ancient seismic activity.

Patches, Gundren and Fey investigate the place, finding ancient magical traps and murals depicting a sorcerer of Netheril, its servants bowing to it.

Heading deeper into the ruins, they find a large chamber, depicting artwork recently gouged and vandalized, an altar of grey marble smashed to dust.

Another trap is found and dismantled in the middle of the room and two secret doors are found, one leading to short hallway, the other to a burial chamber with four sarcophagi.

Tark and Cirrus catch up at this point and assist in investigating the room.

The group quickly determine that the four sarcophagi contain undead and that a small Urn, when rotated will open the Sarcophagi as well as a passage to another room.

Fey magically alters the weight of one of the lids and the group trigger the Urn after trapping the remaining stone containers.

Wraiths and shadows rise from the Sarcophagi but the group, experts in battling the Undead, annihilate them quickly and without injury.

The group moves over to the swiveling wall section revealed by the switch and trigger it, moving themselves into another room, this one untouched and pristine though coated in thick dust.

A large white marble sarcophagi, covered in copper relief and depicting a sorcerer on the stone covering takes up most of one thirty foot wall.

As the group moves in, they note a perfect area of dustless stone by the foot of the Sarcophagus.

Fey notes an enchantment and figures it to be an invisible chest.  

He goes over and opens the top, seeing the glitter of treasure, but hearing the grind of stone as the slab atop the sepulcher moves and shifts.

A linen wrapped hand, covered in rings and jewelry grips the edge of the sarcophagus and the Mummy contained within begins to rise!
