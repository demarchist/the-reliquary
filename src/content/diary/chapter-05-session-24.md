## The Dragon Unleashed

Rahadin faced the group in his full glory as the castle trembled and cracked. Mordenkainen ducked through the destroyed chapel-hall doors, took cover behind a suit of armour, and began pouring a witch bolt into the second set of copper doors. Patches slinked in after him and scanned the shadows — three vampires waited on the ceiling: Anastrasya in red, Ludmilla in white, and the teenage Gertruda. She pulled two grenades from her belt and rolled them down the hall.

The detonations sprayed holy water and blinding light. Every vampire screamed and dropped from the ceiling. The thrall Escher clipped the witch bolt and was torn apart by lightning. Volenta hit the floor writhing, her skin blistered. Patches opened the bag of holding and called for Ireena, who leapt forth with journals tucked in her belt. Patches nodded toward the blinded vampires. "Strahd's ex-wives," she said. Ireena smirked and hefted a spear, impaling Ludmilla to the wall.

## The Grand Hall

In the main chamber, Fëanon assaulted Rahadin's mind with a phantasmal killer — the spectre of his long-dead brother Argynvost, covered in blood. The attack startled the dragon but the shadowy aura flared, absorbing the damage. Fëanon's Bigby tentacle smashed the dragon's flank. Rahadin didn't flinch. Snow and frost began collecting around his muzzle.

Rahadin's tail swept the battlefield. Gwen ducked flat. Derik, already wounded, took the blow bodily and was thrown twenty feet into a stone pillar. He did not get up.

JmJm told a terrible joke about bards and scales, charged with subtle power. Rahadin began laughing and sank to the floor. Ezmerelda seized the opening and lunged repeatedly — but the shadow aura congealed around each thrust, absorbing every strike. Tark yelled that the dragon was about to breathe on the stairs. Stick cast a passwall, creating a tunnel off the staircase. Everyone dove for cover, loosing arrows and shots as they fled. Soulless villagers rushed in pursuit, funnelling into the narrow passage.

Rahadin shook off the laughter and held his breath, preparing. His shadow stretched across the floor and a huge shade rose before Buumi — the Atropal, reaching out tendrils that sapped the paladin's life force to regenerate the dragon's protective aura. Tark shadowstepped to his friend's side and attacked the shadow creature. Buumi brought Ashbringer down on the shade, its light burning away swathes of dark essence. He recognised the energy as an Atropal and called out a warning.

## The Chapel Breach

Mordenkainen reinforced his witch bolt with his own life force. The second copper door exploded in a shower of molten shards. The way to the chapel lay open. Ireena rushed forward but pulled up short — each energy pulse from the artifact would kill an unprotected person. She called into the chapel above the din: Rahadin had betrayed him for aeons. They had proof.

Strahd called back that he would not be stopped. He did not believe Ireena was here of her own free will.

Meanwhile, Patches and Ireena fought the vampire brides. Ireena alternated between Gertruda and Anastrasya with vicious swordwork — cutting Gertruda's hand off at the wrist and driving deep stabs into the others. Patches impaled Escher with her luck blade and the vampire exploded to dust. She turned and stabbed Gertruda with the Reaver, activating her armour's blur. Ludmilla tore the spear from her chest and hurled it at Mordenkainen — it bounced off his spell-infused robes. She skittered up the wall on all fours to attack from above. Patches kicked Anastrasya back into the witch bolt. The vampire was torn apart by the energy and exploded to ash.

## The Atropal

Back in the grand hall, the soulless villagers poured down the stairs, the traps spent. The front doors slammed open as skeleton warriors marched inside — Lady Wachter directing them forward. Gwen lay in ambush and unleashed a lightning bolt from her jaws that blew the ogre zombie and every skeleton apart, the bolt slamming into Lady Wachter herself.

Rahadin ascended sixty feet, hovering just under the ceiling. His wings buffeted the battlefield, destroying the Bigby construct. JmJm ducked and turned his attention to the two vampire thralls that had rushed him, parrying every strike and barking with laughter. Ezmerelda cursed the dragon but the magic slid away. Rahadin landed crushing blows on her, battering the vampire hunter badly with claws and a horn before she rolled clear.

Stick grabbed a slab of rock with telekinesis and slammed it onto Rahadin's back. Cirrus summoned sickening radiance around the hovering dragon, burning the shadow aura. Stick enlarged Buumi to giant proportions. The Atropal drained life from both Buumi and Tark — the protective aura flickered back. Tark screamed and unleashed a flurry of strikes. His staff shattered the shadow creature, the dark essence streaming back to Rahadin.

The dragon crashed to the floor, stunned by the Atropal's destruction. Every weapon turned on the incapacitated beast, finally drawing blood. Buumi smashed Ashbringer down on cracking scales, empowering the blade with holy light. Two points of radiance trailed from the sword — golden halos settling over Patches and Cyrrus. The spirit of Argynvost spoke through Cyrrus, condemning Rahadin. The spirit of Anduriel spoke through Patches, declaring the dragon's time at an end. Gundren broke the moment by firing two shells that blew scales apart and splattered blood.

Lady Wachter staggered into the hall and raised her hand to cast — Gwen leapt from concealment and sank mithril teeth into her hamstring. The necromancer went down screaming and pointed at Fëanon. He batted the finger of death aside with his staff in a shower of green sparks. Gwen raked the woman's back to ribbons. Fëanon's fireball washed over both Lady Wachter and Rahadin — the necromancer of Vallaki burned to death, foam on her lips. One side of Rahadin's torso was blackened, scales missing.

Rahadin's aura erupted in orange lightning and the enraged dragon climbed back to his feet. His jaws reached for Buumi but Ashbringer deflected the bite. His tail caught the giant paladin and knocked him prone. A massive claw followed. JmJm rolled with the tail and came up swinging. Buumi blocked the snapping maw with his gauntlet, rolled to his feet, and tried to grapple — but one-armed, the dragon wrenched free.

The Atropal rose again from the floor at Cyrrus's feet, killing the swarm of ravens around him and draining nearby soulless. Tark shadowstepped behind it, hammering away. Herti and Gibra shot arrows into Rahadin. Danica shot one of Cyrrus's attackers from her floating perch. The shadow aura and Atropal were nearly gone — until the soulless ran past and fed it their life force. Gwen leapt at the creature, claws shredding. Rahadin, surrounded, let out a frustrated growl and prepared another breath.

Across the hall, the chapel door was open. Ireena stood at its threshold. The castle was shattering around them, magenta light seeping through widening cracks. The group was battered, magically taxed, and utterly done with Barovia — but so was the dragon.
