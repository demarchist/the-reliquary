Feanon is awoken from his Reverie by a knock on his door, annoyed, Fea gets up and checks through the peep slot on the door.

He sees Beryan the Sage, already walking off with a bundle of books, but she calls back, saying that his apprentice was waiting for him in the lobby.

It takes Fea a moment to sort out what he is hearing and then rushes to dress, eager to meet his first prospective student.

He takes the elevator to the lobby and sees Guiseppe manning (Gnoming?) the front desk, and a young High-Elf standing nearby.

Feanon gives the lad a look over, noting the school robes, their disrepair, the class ring and the noble pendent.

Fea approches and welcomes the mage, who introduces himself as Ruthir K’Ree.

Feanon accurately predicts the youth’s backstory: He is newly graduated from the Silverymoon mages academy and has spent a few years adventuring, now he wants to find a master.  He wishes for that master to be Feanon.

Fea is thrilled, but doesnt show it, acting the appropriate wise master.  He accepts the elven youth (Despite no letter of recommendation) and takes the offering of tuition: A broken Ring of Spell Turning from Myth Drannor.

He shows the youth to his chambers, a modest affair one level down from the great Library hall.

Ruthir is pleased and gets right to work for his new Master.


Tark meanwhile, has been enjoying himself thoroughly in the woods.

With the bear cub following him around, Tark trained and meditated.

Later in the week, he runs across Doc B as the little Druid is out for a walk.

Doc greets him and the bear, and lets Tark know that he knows the location of the Tree House.

Concerned, Tark has Doc Promise not to tell anyone and the Druid agrees, inviting Tark to come by the Crystal Cave and see Cercei the next day.

Tark agrees.

He then goes to see Buumi at the keep, knocking on Buumi’s door.

The Paladin invites his friend inside and they share a drink and some food; Buumi showing off his new cooking skills.

Tark aks if Buumi will come to Blingdenstone and Buumi says he will if they want him to.

Tark thanks his friend but says it wont be necessary.

Buumi then says he will be leaving for a few days to visit his brother and take Patches book to a printer.

Tark correctly assumes she wants a copy for each member of the group and Buumi agrees with a chuckle.

That night, Tark dreams the same dream as before, of his parents and his room from long ago.

This time however, Tark manages to take control of the dream and turn his head, finally seeing what was casting the brilliant reflections across the ceiling.

In the hearth of the abode, is a roaring fire and at its heart, a large Crystalline egg.

Willing his dream-self forwards, Tark reaches into the fire and touches the egg.

He immediately feels a friendly, curious presence in his mind and a warmth on his hand.

He wakes up, and thinks on the dream, curious what it could mean.

He visits Doc and has a breakfast of Goodberries, seeing Cercei and seeing that the Dragon is slowly healing.

He bids Doc goodby for now and then heads back to the Barony proper, to prepare to leave with the group to head back to Blingdenstone.


Cirrus tries the Well of Many Worlds once more.

He casts it against his wall, and a portal of golden light appears on the wall.

Cirrus steps up to it and peers through and his breath catches as he beholds a wondrous sight.

He finds himself looking across the slopes of an alpine meadow, the mountainside falling away before him, down to rolling hills, plains and meandering rivers of idyllic beauty.

Up the slope is a grand mountain of ice-sheets and glaciers...and above that, instead of open blue sky, is another land formation, flipped.

Gravity reverses not far above the peaks of the mountains, indeed some have great columns of ice connecting them.

The landmass that Cirrus stands on appears warm, with more tones of amber, yellows and reds, as if in autumn.

The landmass above seems to be a vibrant green, wet and stormy. Verdant.

Cirrus steps through the portal and closes it behind him.  He finds himself on a road.

High up on the mountainside, he is standing on a cobblestone trail carved into the mountainside, clearly well travelled, but with grass growing up between the bricks.

Looking across the magnificent landscape Cirrus sees a great deal of wildlife; great elk, marmots, golden eagles and the like.

Cirrus starts along the road, his owl spying a massive tower carved into the peak farther up the mountainside.

Using the familiar, Cirrus scouts the surrounding, seeing the world through it’s magnificent eyes.

Then, he spots it, farther along the path so far that scale became confusing; a small caravan.

Cirrus decides to walk to meet them.

Two hours later, they finally grow close enough to speak and the Warlock discovers it to be a covered wagon, manned by Rock Gnomes.

They greet one another and Cirrus strikes up a conversation, hoping to find out where he is.

When the Gnomes find out he has no idea where they are, they are concerned, making sure he intended to be on this Plane of Existence; Bytopia, The Twin Paradises, and afterlife of the Gnomes.

They point up the road, toward a large stone fortress built into the mountainside.  They call it **Stronghaven, Domain of the Gnomish god Gaedral Ironhand**.

Cirrus blinks in surprise and mentions that he knows many Gnomes that would be ecstatic to come here if they would give him a tuning fork to the Plane.

The leader of the Gnomes; **Bildaboi**, Inspects the Warlock, asking him questions and gets a sense of him.

Satisfied, the leader agrees to a trade; a fork for a fork.

Cirrus agrees and offers his fork for The Plane of Water.  

The leader is a bit disappointed - Elemental Planes are a bit less valuable, but he accepts in exchange for a future favor from Lord Cirrus, valued at 10,000gp or equivalent currency.

The Warlock agrees and hands over his Zinc Fork and takes possession of the Solid Gold Fork in possession of the group leader.

The gnomes go to take their leave, heading back to their town of Rumblecuppse in the valley, the leader pointing it out along the river bank.

Cirrus thanks them and then takes his leave, walking a bit farther before planeshifting home, excited to surprise his friends with this news.


Snorbul meanwhile, returns to Blingdenstone proper with Thorna.

Having secured the opening negotiations with the Wererats, Snorbul stops by Trisk before heading back to the Barony.

He gets the young Warden to promise Snorbul the Warden Tattoos when the group returns to Blingdenstone.

Trisk doesnt know if he can learn by then, but says he will try and work with Gurnik to learn faster.

Snorbul hands the Gnome a bag of Sapphires for the ink and then meets with Thorna and Feanon to be teleported back to the Barony.

Back top-side, Snorbul heads to his FIghting pit, eager to see the progress the Dwarves have made…


The final day before the group heads back from their week on the surface, Patches gets a visitor at her establishment.

As she enters her private rooms beneath Over the Moon, she steps off to the side, into deeper shadows as she realizes something is amiss.

Focusing, she sees a figure, slumped in a chair by the fireplace.

She recognizes the robes as belonging to Mordenkainen and sure enough, standing upright, next to the chair is the Sentient Wizard Staff; Stick.

Mordy coughs and croaks out a greeting.  Stick is far more up-beat, but does mention that if Patches gets within 2ft of Mordy, he’ll have to “frag” her.

Patches stops in her tracks, reaching to see if she can help Morty, and backs off instead.

They begin to talk, Patches inquiring about Mordy’s present condition.

It turns out that the Liches of Oerth are getting uppity as well and a minion of Vecna got a “good shot” on him, disintegrating half of his body.

Mordy does point out that Patches should see the other guy.

She asks if she should bring a healer, and more importantly, why he is in her inner chambers of all places.

Mordy waves away the idea of a healer, tapping a ring of regeneration on one finger and the amniotic sack securing his insides.  He says he will be fine in three days and needs a place to lay low.

Patches shows Mordy the rubbings from the Elven Shrine beneath the Chardalyn mines and asks the Archmage what he thinks.

Together with Stick, Mordenkainen translates and interprets what he sees, Stick writing down the translation.

He says that these are ancient reliefs depicting Elven Celestial History, from before or during, The Crown Wars that split the elven race and cursed the Drow.  They show Abraxim, the fool and arrogant Archmage traversing the outer edge of existence, sneaking past The Watchers. He is then consumed or infected (unclear) by Halashnar, The Pallid Prince and returns to the world, a vessel for a great evil.

There he started to consume and change all those he came across until the Elves led by Sehanine Moonbow, Aspect of Selune, defeated Halashnar and Drove Abraxim away past great icy mountains.

Patches wonders if it might mean The Spine of The World and Mordenkainen agrees, thinking it a sound theory.

Patches then mentions the Barony Auction House, and tells the Archwizard that they plan on selling many interesting things if he or those he knows are interested.

Mordy smiles and nods, saying he’s always interested in magical items.

Patches thanks Mordy and takes her leave, seeing to her Establishment.


With the group having taken care of their business in the Barony and feeling truly refreshed, they teleport back to Blingdenstone (Jin the painter and Topsy in tow), to a predetermined room cleared of any Wild-magic.

Word quickly spreads of the groups return and they are quickly led to where the Gnomes have set up a War-table.

The group moves through the city and immediately notes that it appears crowded with many armed and armored dour-faced gnomes marching about or tending to their gear (much of it new and Mythril!).

A good Dozen different Earth Elementals are spotted in the caverns and several more are on guard by the War-table.

The Gnomes have brought together a pretty serious fighting force.

The group speaks with Chief Diggermattock and Gurnik Tapfingers and get the scout report: There appears to be a massive force of Demons and Oozes around a building known only as “The Dome” and the entire Northern cavers are infested by lesser Oozes.

The group asks about the Wererats as allies and Dorbo Diggermattock replies that they cannot be counted on, no emissary has returned beyond Snorbul and Trisk’s initial parlay.

Patches nudges Cirrus and the Warlock steps forward, proclaiming that he will visit the Wererats and bring them to the cause

He motions to Topsy, proffering her as his emissary directly to her Wererat kin.

Dorbo agrees and says they will continue to prepare.

The group then steps aside to talk and plan.

First things first, Snorbul heads with Gurnik (Gnome Priest) and Jin the human illusionist, to meet Trisk(young Gnome warrior that was petrified) at the Shrine to get tattooed.

The group follows, draggin the poor Jin along with them to assist with the tattooing.

They arrive at the shrine and set up, Snorbul getting comfortable for what will surely be a long and very painful process.

The next four hours are excruciating for Snorbul, though he bears the pain well.

Trisk, Gurnik and Jin manage to work the spell-gem ink into the “Root” of a Warden’s Tattoos, around the base of the skull and shoulders.

The ink glitters under the skin, the tiny pieces of gemstone picking up the light.

Snorbul grins as he feels new powers begin to infuse his body, his connection with the stone and earth growing stronger.

Snorbul gains the following feat: Svirfneblin Deep Magic.

Snorbul thanks Trisk, Jin and Gurnik, excited to now head north and use his new abilities.

The group thanks the Gnomes, leaves Jin at the Shrine (by his own request) and then they head north, to visit the Wererats in their Warrens.

They meet up with Boulda, the Wererat girl they saved from Petrification and she thanks the group for coming with her, she’s unsure if she could survive the trip on her own so see her kin.

Topsy comes with the group, shy, but waving a greeting at Boulda, who smiles a toothy grin in reply.

As the group approaches the tunnels and exit of Settled Blingdenstone, they see an altercation ahead.

A metal gate has opened and an Earth Elemental is battling a single Barlgura.

Deep Gnomes rush forwards with Mythril spears and skewer the Demon as the Elemental grapples it.

The demon is killed in short order and the Gnomes return to their posts.

As the group passes, they warn them that beyond the tunnel here, it is quite inhospitable.

The group thanks them for the warning and head into the long, dark tunnel connecting the two parts of the Gnome city.

They come out on the other side to an immediate threat.

Three oozes sludge toward the group and the party leaps into action, moving forward and destroying the resilient things.

The group notes that the lights here are torches, casting flickering illumination, revealing a messy and decrepit warren.  Rats live here, and it shows.

Moving forward, they see a Gelatinous Cube devouring a Deep Gnome Corpse, they kill the cube and go to move on, but notice a larger conflict.

Around them, the walls shift and move, a dozen LARGE oozes shifting toward new prey entering their territory.

Among the shadowed refuse, two large rat-like creatures can be seen battling a large Barlgura Demon, and losing.

The party leaps into action, moving to save the Wererats first and neutralize the Demon.

The oozes begin to be shot at by the ranged characters and they quickly destroy each.

One makes it to Snorbul just as he and Patches destroy the Barlgura and the thing tries (and fails) to consume the Barbarian as he’s pressed agains the wall.

Tark leaps to destroy a Gelatinous Cube that had filled a side halfway out to a large chamber.

As he stands there, skin red from the caustic jellies, he hears a familiar whining drone.

The Demonic Chasme Demon rushes around a wall and into sight, flying straight at the group.

As it nears though, Feanon reaches out with a powerful Necromantic spell and simply rips the moisture from the being.

The demon howls and immediately turns to flee, but is set upon by Tark and destroyed quickly.

The battle is over quickly, though they suffered a few scrapes and burns.

The Wererats hop nearby, shying away and not approaching.

Boulda approaches the wererat corpse and asks for healing as the thing begins to regenerate, sputtering back to ragged breathing, barely alive.

THe group crowds around, as the suffering Wererat is quickly healed by Cirrus and the power of Selune…
