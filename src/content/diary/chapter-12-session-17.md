Doc and JmJm are alive and back in the hands of the group!

The lone surviving cultist is tied up

Looking over Doc and JmJm, both appear to be in a bad state, riddled with corruption

Buumi and Cirrus both move to their friends sides and begin to cast healing magics on them, alleviating their symptoms.

JmJm, coughs and weakly mentions the Volcano to the south

Moments later, he blinks open his eyes and sits up, while Doc remains unconscious

JmJm is shocked to be surrounded by his friends and his friends are just as shocked to find JmJm here

They both question one another until they are confident that they are who they say they are.

Buumi takes some time to explain the situation to JmJm; Al’askar, Wild Magic and the dark and shattered world they find themselves in.

They are trapped in another world - not Faerun

They are looking for a way home and have a few leads; An ancient Saurian named Hasrala is working on the Ringed Veil (stargate) and there is a way back to Faerun through this world’s Faewild (according to one of the gods of this world).

The Weave is broken, with spellcasting often causing Wild Magic and tearing rifts to the Shadowfell

The gods here are weakened and sequestered save one - Zalaam god of Death

Zalaam is an imposter/usurper not originally from this world

A catastrophe 1,000 years ago caused his ascendence and the damage to this world

It killed the Saurians, the main race of this world, leaving their advanced technology behind

Technology at the heart of which is a Fragment of the Last Word.

This Fragment is at the heart of their empire - the Pyramid of Barzok, at the heart of Sharzad, city of the Dead.

Metal is scarce and conducts Wild Magic, often leading to deadly burns and electrocutions

Magic is looked down on as having broken the world and is regulated by the Medjai - this world’s Paladins (sort of)

JmJm takes it in, he mentions that its good the group has finally branched out from a single plane of existence and talks about his time as a child in the City of Doors.  He gathers his gear from the dead cultists, but wisely limits what metal and magic items he wears.

The group grabs the unconscious cultist and head out from the site of their battle

An issue quickly arises, in that the shifting sands of the desert make it hard to navigate

Despite the height advantages from flying up and surveying the area, it takes the group some time to spot the chunk of the spelljammer and head toward it.

After an hour of hiking, they arrive, only to find that its not the same piece they left before.

A smaller section of hull and deck, the group still moves in to investigate and they manage to scavenge a section of the helm and navigation system.

Realizing that neither Djoser, nor the ship crew will be coming to this location, Cirrus flies up to see if he can spot them while the rest of the group investigates the crashed ship and scavenges what they can.

While in the sky, Cirrus sees a plume of dust coming toward them caused by massive insectoids.

He also spots what he believes to be the crew, heading South for some reason.

Cirrus returns to the crashed piece of ship and informs the group of the impending insect attack and that the crew is heading south toward the Volcano and likely need rescuing (if not now, then shortly).

The group grabs what they have scavenged and quickly rush from the crash, avoiding the strange insects and heading south to catch up with the crew, Djoser and his group still nowhere to be found.

With the group checking for tracks, doing their best to avoid the sun, sticking to ridges and avoiding the worst of the sand, they manage to catch up to the crew over the next few hours, but lose sight of them as they enter a small ravine.

There are Cacti everywhere and as the group moves through, they are attacked!

Over a dozen of the Cacti shift color, and then move, lashing out with spines and attacking the group

The poisonous things paralyze with a touch and actively drink the blood of any they attach to.

Initially caught unawares, the group quickly rallies with blasts of destructive magic and a brutal assault, the creatures/plants are quickly destroyed but not without the group receiving some nasty wounds from the poisonous spines.

Even the flora in this place are deadly and the group knows that every hour the crew is left unattended, the chance of tragedy rises greatly.

They turn south to pursue, the looming Volcano of Mount Saqar dominating the landscape and the scent of volcanic gasses now thick in the air…
