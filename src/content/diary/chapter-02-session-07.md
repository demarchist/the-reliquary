The group milled about the Moonstone Mask after collecting their reward from Captain Bastillon. Eventually they headed upstairs and into the Tavern of Doors, where Doctor Breakfast and JmJm were preparing for the bard's stage that evening. Gundren and his brothers were making something in the forge — the ring of hammers constant. The entire group pitched in to help JmJm prepare: creating props, fireworks, and an intricately planned performance. Before heading to the stage, several members split off for errands — Buumi to the fishmonger, Patches for more poisons, Fëanon for a few scrolls.

## The Bard's Stage

At the festival stage, Lorde and Gronk were already putting on a tremendous performance. Several audience members were moved by the beauty of the music, and Lorde finished her set in a flourish. Gronk then performed an astounding glockenspiel solo that moved many to tears.

Then it was JmJm's turn. The group worked in perfect harmony, putting on a show the likes of which few had ever seen. The stage lights dimmed and a gout of flame announced JmJm's arrival, winking into view center stage. He mounted a spectral steed, engulfed in faerie fire as petals rained upon the crowd. Standing stones served as an impressive backdrop while fireworks, smoking bottles, and lightning bolts erupted around him. JmJm charmed Lorde into joining him on stage, and the two galloped off together on the spectral mount.

The group found JmJm locked in a passionate kiss with Lorde just as she broke free of the charm. She went to push him from the mount but fell off herself. Gronk appeared, scooped her up, and the pair fled into the night after JmJm refused a bard-off, shouting that he'd see her in Baldur's Gate.

The group split up — half returned to the Moonstone Mask to sleep before the tournament, the rest went out to celebrate. Patches and Fëanon visited the wizard's tent for some magical mind-altering enchantments. JmJm found Penelope Harpell and had an eventful evening with her and her husband.

## Tournament Day

The next morning, the group prepared Tark for combat while Patches, Fëanon, and JmJm recovered from the previous night. They arrived at the arena around 10 AM. The brackets were set: Tark versus Endomycles the dwarven gladiator, and Patches versus Hendrell, Champion of the Moonwood.

The arena had been rearranged with obstacles and cover scattered throughout. Tark rushed Endomycles and immediately knocked him from the ring in the first exchange — winning instantly. The dwarf was thoroughly embarrassed, but Tark diffused the situation with sportsmanship, and they parted on good terms.

Patches used the cover to her advantage, flanking Hendrell and striking with poisoned blades. Paralyzed by the venom, Hendrell was easily knocked from the arena — making Patches the surprising winner. The Champion of the Moonwood had to be attended by priests and stomped off in a huff about the "dirty fighting of the honorless Drow."

## Tark vs. Patches

The next bout pitted the two allies against each other. Patches immediately broke line of sight to stealth. Tark put his back to a wall and activated his enchanted eyepatch, spotting her magical weapons through the obstacles. He rushed Patches and knocked her from the ring before she could react. Tark advanced to the finals against Moot.

## The Attack

As Moot took the stage for the final, Fëanon perked up — he thought he heard familiar arcane syllables. Looking around, he caught sight of a spellcaster in the final motion of a fireball. The explosion erupted, killing bystanders and wounding the group. Thirty enemies threw off disguises and attacked the festival grounds, supported by the powerful mage. Across the broader festival, similar attacks were breaking out — it had degenerated into a full-blown battleground.

The group slaughtered cultists by the score. Doctor Breakfast summoned a lightning storm. Moot killed them by the dozen, but more kept coming. Buumi cut down cultists while taking wicked hits, Patches assassinated stragglers, Tark struck alongside Moot, Gundren blasted away, and Fëanon and JmJm charmed and mesmerized. As the cultist horde thinned, the enemy mage attacked in full force with fire and ice — not realizing many of the group were magically protected. His fire spells bounced off Tark, who closed the distance and pummeled him. Patches landed a devastating sneak attack that paralyzed the mage.

Tark drank another strength potion and, opening his bag of holding, managed to catch the mage inside. Instead of tossing the bag into the ocean, Tark opened it again — catching a Cone of Cold to the face as the mage teleported out and renewed his assault. With most of the group bloodied and battered, Tark made a final dash. Wielding Moot's staff, he crushed the life from the mage.

Looking around the festival grounds, the group saw a similar story playing out everywhere — the cultists were being destroyed, the festival-goers winning out. But who were these attackers, what was their motive, and why had they chosen to assault a festival packed with deadly opponents?
