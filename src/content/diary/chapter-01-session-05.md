As the Balgura lies disintegrating, the ToD springs open and Lothli, JmJm and Dr.B spring forth surprising Harkell and Quetzee who are watching from the door way.

The group catches up, tells each other what they missed. Sleepers then tell then group of their dreams, they all dreamed the exact same thing:  A Dark moon blotting out the stars, an old but majestic castle and a pale serious faced Nobleman of gracious bearing.

Harpell clan gathers to check out the box, the group however is quite guarded and decides to trade access to the box in exchange for some valuable supplies, and even then only Harkell is allowed in.

Group goes to alchemy lab, gathering **supplies**.

Group heads to library and get a book of Drow history and Fey gets the spells Sleep and Dominate person.

Dr.B gets distracted by a massive rat and follows it out to the mini-farm, terrifying the tiny horses.

Buumi and Lothli in the box convince Harkell to stay with the group to analyze the box and provide some extra wizardly services.  He agrees and offers to have the group teleported to Wave Echo Cave.

Patches makes it back to the Library with a satchel of alchemy supplies.

Tark comes across Gundren tinkering with a magical gas mask.

The wardstone gets completed ahead of schedule.

The group then heads outside and meets up, Harkell runs to gather his things, Quetzee gives Dr. B the Ox and Harkells horse in mini-form.

The harpells want regular updates on the box and so gift Fey with a Megascope, a holographic telephone, it can only be used to contact other megascopes and is too large to carry, it can however act as an astral focus for meditation.  Looks like three brass tripods atop which are mounted a series of brass spheres holding crystals on armatures, with many lenses and etched brass gears. Comes with a slab of marble, engraved on which is a focusing glyph, it sits at the center of the megascope.

Then group then teleports within 5 miles of Wave Echo cave using the Harkells mass teleporting rings.

Gundren, who rejoined the party before teleporting, heads into the box to tinker with some new schematics.

The group follows a small deer path into the foothills of the Sword mountains and towards a small box-canyon.

Approaching the canyon, a recent rock slide is apparent as well as a number of Orc prints

Exploring the rock slide, Tark comes across a zombified orc trapped under a boulder, he splats it's head…

Heading further into the canyon, they come across some ruined foundations of old buildings before coming across a carved door frame around a crack in the back of the canyon wall.

The scouts head down this narrow path, directly into the rock face before coming to the bottom of a sinkhole the sky barely visible above.

They see a pit with two tunnels, one left one right and a dead dwarf by the right path.

They determine that the dead dwarf is Nebby, Gundrens youngest brother, Gundren decides to remain behind to give his brother a proper burial.  Patches takes a vial of dead blood and the clan battlehammer signet ring off the corpse.  JmJm tries to steal the dead dwarfs beard, Buumi is very unhappy with this and stops him.

The group then decides to take the left path and makes it into the Cave proper.

In the maze-like interior, they come across the tracks of an Ochre Jelly, the group pushes in deeper down the longest straightest path, unknowingly being stalked by the Jelly.

Seeing a gold ore vein in the natural rock wall, JmJm stops to lick it, exhibiting strange behavior, as the group continues however, the Ocher Jelly drops onto JmJm to begin dissolving him - the doppleganger skin taking the brunt of the assault.

The group fights and kills the Ochre Jelly, with Lothli slicing off a chunk creating a smaller Jelly.  Dr.B manages to blow the jelly off of JmJm with a magical wind.

The group continues on to a large water pool, the group investigates and finds a long dead mage at the bottom, they bring up his corpse, recovering a wand of Magic Missiles and a Belt of Dwarvenkind.

Heading on through the pool into a flooded tunnel, the group makes it back onto dry land just as the tunnel opens up into a large cavern with four Bugbears searching the edge of a crevasse.  The group uses the same wind spell to knock two into the Crevasse, Patches snipes another and the last makes it to the group but does no damage before it's killed.  Seeing numerous pathways, the group decides to cross the crevasse, but checks the bottom, with the group using the ToD as a ferry in conjunction with Tark using the Web bracer to get down.  They see a dead dwarf lord who has on him Gauntlets of Ogre Strength which Buumi gets from Patches.

Climbing out of the Crevasse, the group heads east, finding the chamber that gives the cave it's name.

Moving on they come to an ornate structure in a large cavern with large double doors. They decide to go in through the store room however.  The store room has long since fell to ruin, they find nothing worthwhile inside.

Moving into the main structure, they see a green glowing energy vortex atop a pedestal: The spellforge.

They also see a sleeveless long-coat made of leaves that gradiate from Orange at the collar to green at the hem and a Leather Breastplate with a metal plate on the chest and an ornate Dragon worked into the front.

Approaching the treasure, the group is greeted by the Spectators Igi and Gladi, the group chats with them and determines that the wizard down the hall, Mormesk (human but is still around after 400 years…) can release them from their vigil if the group can prove he's dead or no longer needs their services.  The group asks them about the Balgura prophecy, they know nothing of it but speculate that the "goat" mentioned could be the Demon Lord Orcus, prince of Undeath. 

The group also asks about the Drow and finds out that the Black Spiders lair was back on the other side of the chasm, where the bugbears were searching.

The group decides to head for Mormesk to end the vigil of the Spectators, as they pass the spellforge however, the vortex flares up before snuffing out.  Pulling the Jade frog statue from their packs, it springs to life as a living tree frog made of stone…
