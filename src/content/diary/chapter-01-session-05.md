As the Barlgura lay disintegrating, the Tavern of Doors sprang open and Lothli, JmJm, and Doctor Breakfast burst forth — startling Harkell and Quetzee, who had been watching from the doorway.

## The Sleepers' Vision

The group caught each other up on what they'd missed. The three sleepers then shared something unsettling: they had all dreamed the exact same thing. A dark moon blotting out the stars. An old but majestic castle. A pale, serious-faced nobleman of gracious bearing.

No one could explain the shared dream, but it left an uneasy feeling over the group.

## Dealings with the Harpells

The Harpell clan gathered to examine the Tavern of Doors. The party was guarded about granting access, eventually trading limited entry in exchange for valuable supplies — and even then, only Harkell was allowed inside.

Fëanon visited the alchemy lab and gathered supplies. In the library, the group acquired a book of Drow history, and Fëanon copied the spells Sleep and Dominate Person. Doctor Breakfast got distracted by a massive rat and chased it out to the mini-farm, terrifying the tiny horses.

Buumi and Lothli, still inside the box, convinced Harkell to join the group — he would analyze the Tavern and provide wizardly services in exchange. He agreed and offered to have the party teleported to Wave Echo Cave.

The wardstone was completed ahead of schedule. As the group assembled outside, Quetzee gave Doctor Breakfast the ox and Harkell's horse in miniaturized form. The Harpells, wanting regular updates on the Tavern of Doors, gifted Fëanon a Megascope — a holographic communication device consisting of three brass tripods mounted with crystal-bearing armatures, lenses, and etched brass gears, set around a marble slab engraved with a focusing glyph. It could contact other Megascopes and serve as an astral focus for meditation, though it was far too large to carry.

## Wave Echo Cave

The party teleported to within five miles of Wave Echo Cave using the Harpells' mass teleportation rings. Gundren hopped into the box to tinker with new schematics while the group followed a deer path into the foothills of the Sword Mountains, toward a small box canyon.

A recent rockslide was evident at the canyon entrance, along with numerous orc prints. Tark found a zombified orc trapped under a boulder and splatted its head. Deeper in, they found the ruined foundations of old buildings before reaching a carved doorframe set around a crack in the canyon wall.

The scouts pressed ahead down a narrow passage into the rock, emerging at the bottom of a sinkhole open to the sky above. A pit with two tunnels branched left and right. A dead dwarf lay by the right path.

## Nebby's Grave

The dead dwarf was Nebby — Gundren's youngest brother. Gundren chose to remain behind and give him a proper burial. Patches quietly took a vial of blood and the clan battlehammer signet ring from the corpse. JmJm tried to steal the dead dwarf's beard; Buumi was extremely unhappy about this and stopped him.

## Into the Mine

The group took the left path into the cave proper. In the maze-like interior, they spotted the tracks of an Ochre Jelly and pushed deeper along the longest, straightest passage — unaware they were being stalked.

JmJm paused at a gold ore vein in the rock wall to lick it, exhibiting increasingly strange behavior. The Ochre Jelly chose that moment to drop onto him. The Doppelganger skin he wore as a cape took the brunt of the acid before the group engaged. Lothli sliced off a chunk, creating a smaller jelly, and Doctor Breakfast blasted the creature off JmJm with a magical gust of wind.

Continuing on, they reached a large water pool and found a long-dead mage at the bottom. They hauled up the corpse and recovered a Wand of Magic Missiles and a Belt of Dwarvenkind.

## The Chasm

Wading through a flooded tunnel, the group emerged into a large cavern where four bugbears were searching the edge of a deep crevasse. Doctor Breakfast used the same wind spell to knock two into the void. Patches sniped a third, and the last reached the party but was cut down before dealing any damage.

Spotting numerous pathways, the group decided to cross the crevasse. They used the Tavern of Doors as a ferry while Tark descended on a web line from his bracer, with Lothli anchoring the rope. At the bottom, they found a dead dwarf lord bearing Gauntlets of Ogre Strength, which Buumi received via Patches.

Climbing out on the far side, the group headed east and found the chamber that gave the cave its name — the rhythmic echoing of waves reverberating through stone.

## The Spellforge

Moving on, they came to an ornate structure with large double doors set in a vast cavern. They entered through a storeroom instead, finding it long since fallen to ruin with nothing of value.

Inside the main chamber, a green glowing energy vortex pulsed atop a pedestal: the Spellforge. Nearby lay a sleeveless longcoat made of leaves that faded from orange at the collar to green at the hem, and a leather breastplate with an ornate dragon worked into the chest plate.

Before they could approach the treasure, two Spectators — Igi and Gladi — appeared to greet them. Through conversation, the group learned that a wizard named Mormesk, deeper in the complex, could release the Spectators from their centuries-long vigil. The guardians knew nothing of the Barlgura's prophecy, but speculated that the "Goat Prince" could refer to the Demon Lord Orcus, Prince of Undeath.

The Spectators also revealed that the Black Spider's lair was back on the other side of the chasm, where the bugbears had been searching.

As the group passed the Spellforge on their way to find Mormesk, the energy vortex flared violently — then snuffed out entirely. The jade frog statue in their packs sprang to life, becoming a living golem of animated stone. The Spellforge had been absorbed into the frog.
