Tark paused in the restricted hallway, focused on his staff for a moment, then stepped into the Tavern of Doors to meditate. As he did, Doctor Breakfast, Cirrus the Tiefling warlock, and JmJm leaped out — arrayed for adventure. Fëanon dropped his party disguise with a thought. Buumi, feeling self-conscious about clomping around in full plate at a masquerade, asked Fëanon for an illusion to make him look like he was wearing a nice suit.

The group explained the infiltration to the newcomers. Cirrus was thoroughly ready to loot the place for all it was worth. Buumi put his foot down — they would steal only what they were hired to steal. The group agreed, though each time something valuable appeared, someone simply distracted Buumi from the theft.

## The Restricted Wing

The wing was a beautiful marble affair lined with suits of armor. Ancient eye constructs patrolled the corridors, designed to allow only authorized personnel past their gaze. The group managed to circumvent enough of them to explore fairly thoroughly.

They came across a young noble couple enjoying each other's company in a secluded alcove, deeply offended at the interruption — until JmJm turned on the charm. Buumi, who had been drinking quite heavily, made borderline terrible passes at the young noblewoman while the rest of the group chatted with her companion. They noticed he was wearing a magical pendant that marked the wearer as authorized. Fëanon immediately put both nobles to sleep, and the group stole the pendant. A drunken Buumi took the time to tuck the two lovebirds into bed before they moved on.

## The Office

Juggling the single pendant to get past the eye constructs, the group discovered an expensive wine pantry — liberating a valuable bottle while Buumi was distracted — then pushed deeper into the structure. They found a secured office locked with a magical keypad. Fëanon deciphered the code quickly, and the group began ransacking the room.

Cirrus grabbed a beautiful ruby rose from the desk and immediately began sinking into the floor. Others rushing to help started getting pulled in as well, until Doctor Breakfast saw the illusion for what it was and shattered it. The group recovered a spellbook, the ruby, and a bottle of Duergar brandy — along with a higher-clearance pendant.

## The Animated Armor

Returning to the main hub, the group approached the central golden column guarded by high-security eye constructs. Placing the higher-clearance pendant in the column deactivated the eyes — but triggered a flash of light that scanned the room. A moment later, every suit of armor lining the walls animated and attacked.

In his drunken stupor, Buumi struggled to fight until he purged the alcohol from his system with divine power. Cirrus hammered the suits with Eldritch blasts but took several arrows in return. Doctor Breakfast called down a searing moonbeam that scoured the battlefield. JmJm rushed in with his smoking rapier, and Patches struck from the shadows wherever she could. Fëanon cast haste and buffs before adding fire blasts of his own. The animated suits went down in smoking heaps.

## The Vault

The golden shaft carried the group to the upper level, where they found a vault sealed with a ringed locking mechanism bearing images of the sun, moon, and stars. An elvish riddle guarded the combination. The group correctly deduced the symbol order and the vault doors swung open onto a gaping maw of darkness.

They stepped inside and found nothing — except a slow clap from behind. An opulent dwarf, Lord Faendral, strode forward and proclaimed the group's foolishness: they had delivered exactly what he wanted. Gas hissed into the chamber. As consciousness faded, the group saw the dwarf dissolve into nothing — an illusion. Cirrus managed to stumble toward the elevator in time to see a squad of grey dwarves in gas masks ascending toward him before darkness took him.
