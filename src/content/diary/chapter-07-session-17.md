**Breakfast and Simulacra **

The group mills around the dining hall grabbing food from the Heroes Feast and settling into their seats.

JmJm looks up from his plate as the children walk in and notes the Amnians milling around in the hall outside.

JmJm​ stares at Leigham and Cercei, seeing not the people, but clay puppets: Simulacra. The Truesight from the night before revealing the truth of the two.

The eccentric bard stands up and walks around the table to Cirrus and begins staring intently at the Warlock.

As sweat beads on JmJm's temple, Cirrus takes note and asks the Bard what's up.

JmJm whispers "Can't you read my thoughts!?" and then realizes that no, the Warlock cannot.

Pulling Cirrus away from the table, he begins to inform the Warlock what he sees.

The others, close by and noting the strange exchange all get up and convene with the Bard and the Warlock and are filled in.

JmJm decides to distract Cercei who has started asking what the groups plans are for the day.  He takes the little girl into the ballroom and starts to dance with her, using illusion magic to change his appearance. 

Cercei and the Amnian Wizard Leigham are not what they should be.  The group cast detect magic and confirm the heavy illusion magic.

Fey decides to approach Leigham as he talks with Abdul.  Patches decides to make her move on Abdul at the same time.

Bumping into the Amnian ambassador, Patches slips some poison into the mans chewing tobacco.  Abdul curses at her, not seeing the sleight of hand and walks away.

Leigham is left talking with Fey as they begin to talk about the nature of conjuration magic.  Eventually, Fey realizes he will just have to be blunt and ask.

Fey asks if Leigham knows he is a copy, a Simulacrum.

Leigham shushes Fey, leaning in closer and checking to see if Abdul had heard. He hadn't.

The Amnian wizard goes on to explain that he is indeed a copy, the real Leigham simply did not want to make the trip up north, so he was created and sent instead.

With Patches looking on and Fey also trying to gain some insight into the wizard, they both believe him to be telling the truth.

Fey asks "what about the little girl? Does she know?".

Leigham looks confused and asks "What girl?".

Fey excuses himself just as the Amnians are preparing to head to Helm's Hold for the day. Chani, Gneiss, Abdul, S'Olaa and Leigham.

JmJm looks across the room and grins at Chani, who stares daggers at him and then leaves the mansion. Gneiss sees and beckons over the Bard.

Gneiss admonishes JmJm for being so creepy toward Chani, but changes the subject as its not the purpose of the talk.  The burly Amnian asks JmJm if he knows where the rest of their team is currently.

JmJm says he does not, and Gneiss says that neither does he, but he swears that he saw Xor, the teams assassin last night down in the docks, disguised.

JmJm is convinced something big is about to go down and asks the Amnian whose side he would be on.  Confused, Gneiss is non-committal but admits that he likes "Whistler" and his friends.

The Amnians then leave the estate.

Back at the breakfast table, Buumi is quite distressed.  If Cercei is not real, then where is she?  

How was the switch made and what wizard is powerful enough to have done it? 

Fey tells them all that creating Sumulacra is beyond even him.  

The group decides that the prime suspect is Mr. Shon, he's been giving off strange vibes and has been around the children almost constantly.

JmJm returns to the group as they are discussing what to do just as Mr. Shon calls from the hall for the children.

As the kids (and teenagers) all turn to leave, heeding Mr. Shon, JmJm shouts that they should all follow him instead and uses some magic to entice them.

Fey goes to Sera and explains their concerns and the group heads to the guard's office while JmJm takes all of the kids to The Purple Room where he can keep an eye on them.

Patches and Gundren head to Mr. Shon's office and looking around, find a long blue hair in the fold out cot.

Mr. Shon is nowhere to be seen and the group convenes with Val in his office, kicking out two guards on their breaks.

Showing the blue hair, the group puts the pieces together and realize that Mr. Shon is most likely Li Xian, the Oni that attacked them at the Sanctum of Karsus, or at the very least an Oni.

They ask Fey to use the hair to scry on the Oni, the wizard says thats a great idea...but he doesn't have the spell prepared...

Cirrus then puts forth the theory that the Wizard that created the Simulacrum of Cercei is the Red Robed female that led the attack on the Sanctum, the one the group never saw but were told about by the giants.

In the Guards office, the group then confronts Val for letting in not only two Simulacra but a shapeshifted Oni.

The man is flustered and pulls a drawer out of his desk to show the group his Truesight Lantern, claiming that he checks everyone that comes to the estate.  The lantern is missing.

As the group asks Val what he remembers, the man begins to seize, foam collecting at the corner of his mouth and he falls from his chair, blood trickling from his nose.

Doc. B and Tark rush forward, stopping the man from biting his tongue while the others hold him down.

Fey blurts that he thinks it's a Geas and motions to Cirrus.

The warlock places a hand on the big man and casts a greater restoration, halting the seizure.

Tark and Buumi go on alert, Tark activating his blindfold and the two of them start patrolling the the estate.

The others then talk to a very weak Val.  There are big portions of his memory missing from the last month and there was a Geas on him to stop him from digging too deep into the missing memories.

The group forcing him to confront holes in the memory triggered the Geas.

The group decides that the children are not safe in the house and that they will teleport them to Sundabar.

Sera pens a letter and stamps it with the Bumidere seal, addressing it to Forgefather Flamestoker of the Dwarven Citadel.

The guards come back in to help carry Val and he is taken to the Purple room, with the children, and the Simulacrum of Cercei.

The group decides to distract the simulacrum and JmJm takes Cercei out to the front of the manor as Fey begins drawing a Teleportation circle.  

The simulacrum throws a veritable tantrum wanting to go with the other kids and wanting to know where.

As she is taken from the room, Patches spots her trying to see the sigil that Fey is drawing.  She leaves and Fey finishes, activating the Teleport.

The children, two guards and Val are taken to Sundabar with Sera's letter, seemingly safe.

Buumi and Tark return, having seen no sign of Shon/Xian.

Doc B then pipes up, saying she can try locating him with magic.  Patrolling the house with Patches, she gets nothing for an hour until just as the spell is about to expire, she gets a contact, on the edge of the estate and moving away.

Rushing to a large window to look out, Patches pulls her spyglass out and begins scanning.  She possibly sees a swish of a black robe disappearing out into the Bluelake district.

As she looks around though, she sees the harbor and notes that it is full.  Some forty ships all flying the colors of Baldur's Gate are in harbor.  The third fleet is in for a resupply.

Meanwhile, out front JmJm tries to sit down with the Simulacrum of Cercei but the little girl keeps walking away, heading for the gardens and the hedges.

As JmJm grows frustrated and follows into the hedges, the little creature strikes, casting a modify memory spell on the Bard who cannot quite shake off the spell.

Returning to the front of the manor as the group assembles, deciding that they still need to head to Helm's Hold, JmJm says that the little girl had no idea she was a Simulacrum but she's doing ok.

Buumi turns and stays in the manor, unwilling to watch what the others had agreed to do.

Cirrus blasts the little girl with Eldritch energy.

The simulacrum flies back 10ft, skidding through the gravel of the driveway.  It sits up and simply stares at Cirrus.

Surprised that it could take the hit, Cirrus blasts her again and the spell unravels, the body exploding and showering the area with clay.

JmJm sags forward as his memories become his own again.  Sobbing, he tells the group that the Simulacrum attacked his mind and he couldn't resist.

Shocked, the group wonders how the Simulacrum of the little dragonling could have possibly had access to such powerful magic.

Buumi returns to the group, giving the pile of clay a wide berth as they begin to head out from the estate, trusting his mother to relay the pertinent information to the house guard and the rest of his family.

As they are leaving, Sera rushes from the house to hand them a note before heading back in.

The note reads that the Dragonborn Mercenaries have sensed another Dragon in the city...

**The Council of Helm's Hold**

The group makes their way through the Bluelake district and to the keep, to the Guild-run tower and the circle held there**​.  **There is no sign of Mr. Shon on the way.

As they travel, they overhear a guard confirm that the BG Third Fleet is in port for a resupply.

Taking the circle, the group arrives at Helm's Hold and head down the main tower to the Grand Cathedral.

Walking into the massive chamber, the group easily spots the gathering, over fifty people all in the center, chairs and tables ringing the platinum pool that the waterfall was pouring into the day before.

No waterfall flows today and the pool is calm and still.

The group approaches and spots numerous people that they recognize, and many that they don't.

They recognize: Megno, Renear Neverember, Laerel SIlverhand, Thelm, Amarandine, Javen, Aurinax, Anaxtrasa and many more.

A woman in a blue gown, with tanned skin and dark hair stares intently at Fey'Anon, though he knows not why and does not recognize her.

As people mill around, Amarandine, the high cleric of Helm calls forth, her voice booming magically and calls the council to session.

Stepping out onto the pool, the group realize that there is a glass floor there now and the halfling woman walks out into the center, motioning for the group to join her.

Addressing the gathering, Cirrus begins to go into their tale, starting with the groups adventure in Phandalin (before he joined, but well known to him).

As the tale progresses and many of the people in attendance were a part of events, they stand and help corroborate the tale.  

Poor Archmage Amaram of Baldur's Gate begins to stand when the group gets to that part of the story, but as Cirrus does not wish to shine a spotlight on the Artifact, they gloss over him. 

He sits back down disappointed...

The group gets to the battle of Baldur's Gate, Ysera's sacrifice, the Atropal and its destruction and being transported to Barovia.

As they continue the tale of that dark place, they get to Mordenkainen and he joins the group standing in the center of the gathering, supporting and corroborating their claims.

They explain the darkness of Barovia; Rahadin and Baba Lysaga and their plan for Strahd.  Anaxtrasa confirms the location of Ravenloft castle in the Anauroch, and that she has now claimed it.

By this point, the whispers are beginning as enough of the story has been told that people are realizing that whatever the group is omitting is extremely powerful.

The group continues their tale, leaving the Anauroch, Mordenkainen leaving for Oerth to find allies but finding none, heading to Sundabar and then on to Silverymoon.

The group focuses their tale on the Illithid hive, the Eye of Theodemir and the rise of Zhengyi, glossing over the Amnian coup attempt for the most part.

They begin to wrap their tale up with the Sanctum of Karsus, seeing Atropos free of the Far Realm and the Oni attack.

As they end, the gathering erupts into conversation as the different delegations begin discussing the information - most of which had been at least mentioned in the report delivered by Thelm.

Amarandine thanks the group and tells them that they are free to go if they wish, though having them stay to answer questions would be appreciated.

Patches sees Lady Faye with Lemerlais on the outskirts of one of the groups and approaches.  Talking, Lady Faye makes it clear that the lack of information on the Artifact has created a question for everyone.  What are they not being told?

Additionally, Lemerlais says that the south was not as affected by the Mists as they all thought.  They still had the mists, but rather than calling hordes of shambling dead each night, the undead were disparate and easily dispatched.

The mists had been focused on the North, on Neverwinter.

The next few hours ends up being fairly boring as the different delegations begin to form into two camps - The Amnians, Tethyrians and Cormyrians on one side and everyone else on the other.

It appears that the sticking point for the Southerners seems to be the omission of what the artifact is.  Cirrus sees Abdul (who is not looking so good) about to stand and address the gathering, but Cirrus beats him to it.

With Thaumaturgy, Cirrus addresses the gathering and details what they know of The Last Word, that they have two pieces held in Sundabar (to which Megno and Forgefather Halfhand nod).

Realizing that the Amnians would never stand for the north holding two potential doomsday weapons, he goes on to ask the gathering if it would be acceptable to send the two pieces to be held by Bahamut (a move supported by Aurinax, to which Ana just rolls her eyes).

Abdul looks furious, the wind taken from his sails but the rest of the southern delegations all seem to consider it.

The disparate groups all go back to talking, leaving the party some time.

As they wait, they discuss the Barony of Thunder Bluff, considering the name of the keep they are building there.

Mordenkainen approaches and thanks the group, he lets them know that they found little from the box and scried the previous owners - a middleman who simply passed the box along.  Mordy explains that the box likely changed hands a dozen times to get into the city.

Buumi asks if he could scry on a piece of hair and has the group give Mordy the Oni hair.  

Delly hovers over in her crystal throne.

Mordy takes the hair and a few moments later comes back to the group shaking his head.  He claims the spell hit a barrier, that the Oni has a spell of non-detection active.

Fey has his doubts, thinking that Mordy probably just messed up the spell, but Delly chimes in saying that it is the standard countermeasure against divination.

The two archmages head back to schmoozing.

Patches lifts the drained Necklace of fireballs from JmJm as he poses and makes eyes at Anaxtrasa.  

After taking it, Patches drains the luster from each ruby and then notes Doc B looking up at the gems, eyes wide.  The little druid asks if he can have them now that she's done with the rubies, intending to have another jeweled bowl made by Gundren.

Cirrus brings up that he wants to call the keep at Thunder Bluff: Herald's Keep.  Everyone agrees.

Doc B gets excited at the prospect of a Druid Grove and JmJm decides he will raise a Theater named "The Crossroads" next to Patches "Over the Moon" Tavern (so it would be Over the Moon at The Crossroads).

Meanwhile, Fey heads to talk to the woman in the blue gown that he noted watching him earlier.  Approaching, the woman takes note and introduces herself as Lady Avelyere of Netheril.

Excited at the prospect of meeting a Netherese Arcanist, Fey introduces himself.  The woman is a little standoffish and Fey finds out that's because she recognizes the robes he took from the Sanctum.  She sees them as Netherese and that Fey wearing them is a bit of cultural appropriation.

Fey gets lost in conversation over the resurgent Netherese Empire and begins to talk with the woman about the current politics of the magocracy.  He is disappointed to find that during the time in the Shadowfell, Shade Enclave turned from a meritocracy to an Aristocracy.  He returns to the group, excusing himself and Lady Avelyere watches him go, curious.

As they are discussing the Barony, Lord Esimir Von Bumidere approaches.  He points out that most people are done for the day and that he has invited the Amnians to dine with them tonight and that Lord Neverember will join them to try and better sway the delegation to their cause.

He turns to head back to the Estate by way of the Teleportation circle and the group joins him, traveling back to the estate with Esimir and the Amnians.

The group teleports with Mordenkainen and Delly back to the city and the two Archmages say their goodnights, heading to their rooms in the keep.  

The group heads back to the Bumidere estate.

**Dinner at the Bumidere's****​**

Back at the Estate, things have calmed down from the morning and guards can be seen at the gates.

The mansion is well lit and wait staff are carrying around drinks and small bites.

Lord Neverember and two bodyguards are in attendance, the guards remaining behind him at all times in dark leather armor and blue cloaks, their hoods up and faces mostly hidden.

Dagult Neverember takes his time to talk extensively with Abdul and S'Olaa.  Esimir is with him and they are doing their best to win the Amnians over with logic and sound arguments.

It appears to be working and S'Olaa at least seems convinced.  

Abdul is looking worse and worse as the poisoned tobacco keeps taking its toll.

Dinner is eventually called and everyone moves into the dining hall to take their places, a strange juxtaposition of adventuring garb next to noble dress.

Gundren wants nothing to do with the nobles and decides that the best place for the night is closest to the food.  He and Gwen traipse over to the kitchens to settle in.

At the dinner, small talk commences through the main course - Underdark giant Crab Legs served with Rothe butter and topped with Bluecap spores.  Patches is pleasantly surprised, but wonders where they got the dish.

The main course ends and drinks are re-poured.  Abdul starts coughing furiously and covers his mouth with his hankerchief, he sees some blood (as does Patches) and the man gets up to excuse himself and go to his room.

As he leaves, Cirrus asks if S'Olaa can continue the talks and negotiations.  Abdul waves it off and grunts in acquiescence and leaves the room.

Everyone turns to S'Olaa and they ask him if the course of action with Bahamut works. Gneiss and Chani look to him expectantly.

Esimir, who had gotten up to stand near the window to talk with Leigham, turns to watch as S'Olaa picks up his cup to agree and begins to make a toast. Lord Neverember remains in his seat, his hands steepled and a smile begins to light his face.

The clock begins to chime 9pm.

A light pattering of rain begins to fall against the large windows of the estate, getting stronger.

Street lights and the bustle of the city can be seen past the dark gardens and the walls of the estate.

The windows of the dining hall shatter and explode inwards in a conflagration.

The fireball engulfs Esimir Von Bumidere, leaving nothing but ash and the Simulacrum of Leigham is thrown to the ground, burning.

Kurt and Ernst both tumble to the ground, their noble clothes catching fire and Sera is pushed over the table, her clothes catching light as well.

Dagult is pushed from his chair, to the ground, licked by flame as his bodyguards rush forwards.

S'Olaa is pushed to the ground, vanishing in a flash as his contingency spell is triggered by the damage.

Patches rolls under the table, avoiding the flames entirely as everyone else in the room is burned by the fire.

Fey is not caught off guard and registers the attack - Two fireballs hit the Dining Hall from the outside, but the house has been struck multiple times.

The Estate begins to burn, the protective wards seemingly doing nothing...
