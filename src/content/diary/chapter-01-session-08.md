The group finished searching the shrine of Orcus and found nothing else of value. Moving back to the room with the ladder, they discovered several pearls embedded in the fleshy folds of the walls. Climbing up, they emerged one floor above and came face to face with JmJm and an unknown barbarian, both unconscious.

JmJm woke with a start and immediately showed signs of insanity, compulsively biting down on a gold coin. The barbarian was freed by Tark, who swept the halfling into an enormous hug.

## The Gauntlet

Scouting ahead, the group encountered a pack of zombies. They trapped the hallway and lured the undead back into the kill zone, destroying them easily. During the fight, a massive trap in the center of the room slammed down and crushed a straggling zombie flat.

They entered the first hag's chamber, narrowly avoiding another trap. Inside they found gold, a spellbook, and 500 gold worth of spell components. After harvesting the room's trap for later use, they pressed on and spotted a second hag meditating in the next chamber.

Once again, they trapped the hallway and positioned themselves behind the crushing mechanism. Lothli shot the hag and retreated, luring her through each trap in sequence. The combined planning and preparation destroyed the creature, though not before she gouged a massive claw wound across Tark's chest, tearing down to the bone. He drank a healing potion to stay alive.

From the hag's room they recovered gold, two healing potions, a Potion of Cat's Agility, a Longbow +1, two keys, and an old priest's journal detailing his descent into madness. The longer the group lingered in the room, staring at the flayed faces decorating the walls, the more their sanity frayed. Patches went mute.

## Recovery

Using both keys on the door the fat hag had been guarding, they found two large chests inside. One held all their stolen gear. The other was a mimic — they killed it and looted a 200 gold diamond and a Potion of Fire Giant Strength.

Re-equipped and armed with their proper weapons, the group descended the spider-locked stairs using the key from the flesh room. Lothli accidentally triggered a wall-crusher trap in the corridor below and was nearly killed. Tark yanked her free just before the wall slammed home. They used one of their two healing scrolls to save her life.

Beyond the trap, they found a room where blood rained perpetually from the ceiling. They skirted the edges and sprinted through. Past it lay a large chamber filled with pews. As they approached a heavy door at the far end, fleshlings attacked — the group cut them down with quick assassinations and spellwork.

## The Heart

Behind the door was the lair's heart: a massive fleshy beast growing into the walls, screaming at the group to kill it. Among the creature's folds they found the jewelry from the mummy they'd burned and dropped down the pit. The group obliged the creature's request and destroyed it.

## Awakening

The party awoke in the Phandalin inn. Buumi and Doctor Breakfast rushed over as the others sat up — the two of them had managed to drag the unconscious group from the fields outside town to safety but had been unable to wake them.

Patches, still disoriented, reflexively reached into her pack and grasped the cursed sacrificial dagger. Dark energy flooded into her as the weapon attacked her soul, feeding on her life force. Only Buumi's healing magic kept her alive long enough to bring the dagger under her mental control. She subdued it — and in horror realized the full extent of its evil power. She threw it on the table, but the dagger puffed into mist as it left her hand and reappeared at her side. The Reaver was bound to her now.
