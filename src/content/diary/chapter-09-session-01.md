Patches stands atop the Demon Prince, flips her blades over in her hands and plunges them both home.

The group Watches as Demorgorgon Roars in anguish as she stabs both heads in the soft temple.

The Prince of demons falls to the ground in a heap, throwing stone chips and rock dust up in a plume, it’s tentacles twitching and writing in death.

The city is in chaos.

Up at the shut gates between Laduegers Furrow and the Darklake District, the Duergar guards retreat back toward their fortified defenses, proving to be all but annasailable by the automated weapons, metal arms wielding weapons unfolding from the doors.

Around the great gate, balls of Adamantine with lances at their center begin to lash out, rods of metal striking out almost forty feet, striking the stone with thunderclaps, sparks and a shower of gore where they connect.

Fey notices that each weapon is not targeting an individual enemy, but a strike plate buried in the surrounding stone.

The weapons strike numerous times and the friction cases the metal rods to begin to heat up.

East along the furrow, a column of Duergar one thousand strong hits the eastern edge of the massive Derro riot, encountering numerous demons amongst the ranks of the insane creatures.

At the head of the Duergar march two magnificent Golems, one depicting Ladueger god of the Duergar and his daughter, Deep Duerra.  

The massive constructs surge forward laying waste to all in their path.

South, across the bridge, another Golem smashes into the Derro there, looking like an 20ft unfinished maquette of clay, but created from Adamantine.

The creature reaches forth both hands and liquid metal rains from its outstretched fingers, spearing all before it.

Demogorgon stirs, the rocks shifting underneath it.

Tark rushes over and begins to smash at him, desperate to keep it from rising again.

In shock that the thing they killed is beginning to regenerate, Tark attempts to understand it and reaches into the twisted soul of the demon as Fey attempts to ascertain information on a technical level.

Fey realizes what he’s seeing; Demons are essentially Discorporated entities, they build their own bodies while on the Prime Material.  Divine law and limited magic normally force limitations on Extra Planar entities.  The Divine law weakened, and as for magic, it saturates the underdark with abundance - Abyssal energy to be harnessed by the Demon Lords.

Demogorgon refusing the pull back to the Abyss and is consuming the ambient energy and reforming his body, even as he dies.

But what caused the barriers between worlds to weaken so badly that the very laws of the universe can be resisted?

Tark finds out.

Tark sees the great Brass throne of Demogorgon atop a jagged stone spire, a roiling sea of dark waves and shattered stone churning beneath.

The waves rise and fall, showing massive tendrils coiling and twisting around one another; great Krakens of the depths.

Demogorgon sits on his throne.

He looks bored, flaying some unfortunate soul and casting it into the Great Maw that lies beneath his throne.

The sky brightens and flashes, a great tear ripping it apart and a chitinous arm reaches forth, dwarfing even the tower.

It pushes into Demogorgon and casts him from the pinnacle, pushing him through the barriers of the multivers, cracking and smashing them apart.

As the Prince of Demons falls, he sees his peers surrounding him, pushed from their layers within the Abyss, his most hated rivals.

He lands like a comet in the Underdark, Abyssal energies flowing from the wounds in the walls of reality and permeating the Underdark.

As Demogorgon regains his consciousness and shunts Tark from his mind, the last thing the monk feels is a thought: “How DARE Lolth do this! How DARE she cast him out from his own domain!  But no matter, it must have cost her dearly to do this, possible even the fragment of the Weave she stole so long ago…”

Demogorgon rises, and lashes out at Tark, desperate to grab at the lithe monk.

The rest of the group is already backing away, still seriously wounded and in no position to fight the Demon Prince again.

The Golems are still over a minute out, long enough time for Demogorgon to kill them all.

As Tark flips over a grasping tendril, the Demon calls out, asking if he still has “it”

Tark has no idea what he’s talking about.

North, at the gate between districts, the stone wall 60ft away from the gate erupts, a thirty foot section exploding out.

From it, an icy gale erupts, forming ice across every surface within a hundred feet.  Demons pour forth.

The unmistakable minions of Orcus attack the nearby Duergar, hitting the automated defenses like waves crashing on stone.

Until a larger form steps through the hole.

Even hunched, it’s massive, its back arching at least fifteen feet.  It glides forward, gossamer robes flowing around lithe armor-clad limbs and wielding two blue glowing blades.

Atop its head is a circlet of gold and a series of bladelike bars form a mask over a void where it’s face should be.

Snorbul recognizes it from childhood fairytales of demons; a Hierophant of Annihilation, one of Orcus’ barons.

As the creature glides forward, its gaze falls upon the nearby Duergar and they simply drop.  Dead.

As if the group needed any more incentive to leave, Fey moves to putting the finishing touches on his teleportation circle just as Patches rushes up, patting her bag of holding and saying she has the prisoners.

Tark dives away again as Demogorgon halfheartedly reaches for him, but his attention is on the Hierophant.

With a howl of insane rage, Demogorgon vanishes in a thunderclap, reappearing two hundred feet away, unfurling from the reflected image in the eyes of an unfortunate Duergar that caught his glare.

The duergar is promptly torn asunder and the Prince of Demons wades in to battle, lashing at the Champion of Orcus.

Fey finishes the teleportation circle and the last thing they see before the singularity draws the party in, is Anduriel the Narzugon rushing to the aid of her squad, smashing into the Chasme demons flying up from the chasm below…


The light fades and the group finds themselves in Fey’s Teleportation room, the little Moon Elf attendant looks up from her book and stares in shock.

Everyone is covered in gore, their own and Ronts.

Buumi quickly begins a prayer of healing, trying to get everyone back on their feet.

Buumi, Tark and Gundren simply sit.  Exhausted and unable to quite process everything that happened.

Cirrus flips out.

They cannot even be killed now!? What the hell do we do!?

Fey and Tark relay what they saw below - if the Demon Lords could be brought to one place, not only would their hatred for one another cause a battle royale, they would quickly consume the ambient magical energies and kill each other for real, banishing one another back to the Abyss as they deplete the magic.

All that would then remain, would be mopping up “The Winner”.

There’s a healthy dose of skepticism that goes around, and moods are still dour after such a serious battle.

Patches opens her bag and lets out Hemeth and Vilka who reunite with a very shaken Veygar.

The three of them head to the docks to head to Over The Moon.

Cirrus, still in shock, wanders with them, finding Li and demanding she help take him “home”.

After about fifteen minutes, there’s a large group waiting for the auto-boat to ferry them across the lake.

Patches long since slipped into one of her tunnels though and heads to the Tavern herself.

After a solid nap, Gundren, Buumi and Tark head from the tower (Fey long since having retired to his private chambers) to go to the keep.

It take the trio a little bit, Gundren heads through the Dwarven made fortress directly to his massive workshop, a red glow emanating from within.

Ever since dropping unconscious in the battle, he has had a burning NEED to craft something.

The Artificer gets to work.

Buumi takes Tark into the keep, into the baths; a small recreation of the wonderful spa they all enjoyed in Neverwinter.  There, they sleep through the rest of the day.

Over at the Fane of Selune, Cirrus prays in his inner sanctum, yodeling his praise to the goddess beneath the perpetual twilight of the eclipse.

He feels the presence of his goddess and is infused with more power, his pact strengthening for the tasks ahead.

Snorbul heads over to his mining claim and sits down in the dirt, rolls over and goes to sleep.

The Dwarves see he needs a nap and shovel a little gravel on top of him, letting him sleep it off.

Many hours go by and one by one, across the barony, the team begins to awaken from their much needed rest.


Tark awakes in the cool air of the marble chamber, a pool of clean water inset into the floor.  He bathes and the magical waters remain pure and clean.  He cleans his clothes and then cautiously leaves, unsure where he is (though not on edge as Buumi sleeps nearby).

He is reassured as he comes across a servant and she tells him he is within their own keep.

He heads out into the main courtyard, sun beaming down from a blue sky and witnesses the bustle of the castle.  Though he notes they seem a bit understaffed.

Tark looks over Gundrens workshop for the first time an is impressed.

The aqueduct drawing water up the cliff from the river, the waterwheel, the massive peaked roofs and huge panes of glass to let in the light.  A manufactory.

Tark heads over.

The forge and furnace are impressive, as are the many workstations and benches.  Tark greets Barthen and Nundro, Gundren’s two brothers and is directed over to the finishing bench.

He sees gundren putting the finishing touches on two new inventions - A massive Iron Gauntlet (to punch the ground) and an underslung grenade launcher for the Thundercannon.

Tark is impressed, however he recoils in shock when he looks at the Dwarf’s face.

On his forehead is a glowing sigil of metal; a ring, with a dot in the center and another dot transfixed by the ring.

The symbol of Hydrogen (though Tark does not recognize it as that), and the Symbol of Primus, God of Order.

Gundren and Tark then head to the Tavern.

Buumi follows shortly after


Patches finishes up in her rooms, having finished constructing a new set of bombs from the more advanced components that have finally arrived.

She then heads up to the Tavern.


Snorbul awakes under the comfortable dirt.

He informs the Dwarves of his desire to make a fighting pit down here and then heads topside.

He marks in the stone that the mining claim is his home now and then heads to the Tavern.


The group all meet up in Over the Moon to discuss next steps.

Doc B joins them.

The group proceeds to cast a scrying spell, focusing on the other half of the crystal key to Gravenhollow - supposedly in the Deep Gnome “city” of Blingdenstone.

The scrying is a success, but the image is strange, they see the Crystal shard, but it appears to be floating in a mass of viscous liquid, bubbles and detritus suspended within.

Fey puts some information together and when the Scrying ends, he sighs in frustration: He thinks that the crystal lies at the heard of Juiblex, Demon Lord of Oozes.

Terrified that the Demon Lord has laid waste to his family and ancestral home, Snorbul asks for a dreaming and he contacts his uncle.

Still alive, his uncle **Gruttag **greets him within the dream.  After a quick explanation, he accepts the spell for what it is and they begin to talk.

Gruttag, his family and most of the extended clan fled to Blingdenstone after the upheaval of the Winter Solstice and the arrival of the Demon Lords.

The flight was difficult and many did not make it, including **Beltran**, Gruttag’s eldest son and a close friend of Snorbul.

The clan arrived at Blingdenstone two weeks ago and although the ancestral home is not without danger, so far it is a haven from the wilds of the Underdark.

A melancholy seems to be spreading throughout the Deep Gnomes of the settlement though, gripping each person it takes in a strange daze of sadness.

They do their work, but they socialize little.  It concerns Gruttag greatly as the Deep Gnomes are normally extremely social within their clans.

The dreaming ends and Snorbul relays his experience. The group anticipates that the Demon Lord Juiblex is in Blingdenstone and they intend to head there as soon as Aurinax has collected The Artifact.

Needing to determine the state of her son before another detour, Patches asks for a Dreaming and Cirrus obliges.

A new dream forms and resolves itself, Patches choosing the Moondancer Village where Finn lived for the last twenty years, covered in winter snow, pristine, but devoid of life.

Standing in the center of the main clearing, the great trees of the forest rising around them, Patches sees her son, standing and looking at the Moon Elf village.

He turns slowly, a young Drow man with a striking similarity to Patches, clad in Drow Noble attire and his hair newly cut to denote his station.

As Finn spots Patches, his face contorts with a range of emotions and he marches close to her, stopping a few feet away and yells into her face: “LIAR!”.
