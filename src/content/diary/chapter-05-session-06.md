## Ashes and Standing Stones

The group stood at the top of the small hill where the Old Bonegrinder had once turned grain into flour. Now it was nothing but a burning corpse of a building. Fëanon found a bag of holding on Morgantha's remains and tied her severed head to his belt — a trophy or a warning, perhaps both. Tired and hurt and the sun long since gone, they scanned the mist-choked landscape for shelter. The burning windmill was a beacon they could not afford.

Near the treeline, a ring of ancient megaliths offered a defensible perimeter. Patches had an ulterior motive for wanting the stones — she hoped to use them as the focus for a ritual to cleanse her cursed dagger. But when the group arrived, they found a pile of children's teeth heaped in the centre, shed by every child the hags had consumed. The desecration had fouled the site beyond use.

Cyrrus saw the teeth and something inside him snapped. He lunged for them, hands grasping. Fëanon, thinking he was helping, began scooping teeth into the bag of holding. Buumi was having none of it. He seized Cyrrus bodily and dragged him back until the warlock went limp, claiming he had blacked out. Buumi then took the bag from Fëanon, marched back up the hill, and dumped its grisly contents into the burning wreckage before returning the bag without a word.

The group was confused by Patches' urgency about the stones. They had assumed she had long since dominated the sentient evil trapped in her blade. Patches told them the truth: since arriving in Barovia, the hag spirit inside the Reaver had been growing stronger, making attempts to possess her body and consume her soul. For now she held it at bay — but she could not cleanse the weapon here.

## The Fortified Camp

The group dug in at the standing stones, building the most defensible camp they could manage. Fëanon and Cyrrus shaped earthen ramparts and a small moat with magic while Patches strung five tripwire alarms across the approaches. The mounts, children, and bedrolls went inside the perimeter. It was not elegant, but it was solid.

Ireena and Buumi took first watch. Zombies drifted through the mist at irregular intervals — shambling shapes visible for a few seconds before the fog swallowed them again. None approached the camp. After counting several, the group realised the dead were all heading in the same direction: toward Vallaki.

## The Ruined Tower

In the dark hours before dawn, Buumi shook Fëanon awake and pointed into the mist. A will-o-wisp hung in the air, pulsing with cold light. Fëanon, never one to leave a mystery uninvestigated, woke the others. Buumi stayed behind with Ireena and the camp followers while the rest slipped into the fog. Patches breadcrumbed a trail of faintly glowing stones to mark the way back. Tark wrapped the group in darkness.

The wisp led them to an ancient tower, mostly collapsed, half-buried in the earth. Patches circled wide while Cyrrus sent his owl familiar overhead. The owl reported two treasure chests inside the ruins. Fëanon and Cyrrus shrugged at one another and summoned unseen servants to retrieve them.

The moment the first chest was disturbed, the ground erupted. A score of zombies burst from the loose earth at the group's feet.

Patches found herself surrounded by five. The other fifteen closed on Fëanon, Tark, and Cyrrus. Everyone took hits in the initial rush — then Fëanon judged the range, dropped a fireball practically at his own feet, and turned the horde to ash. A section of the tower crumbled and a patch of earth fused to glass. Patches hurled a smoke bomb, disengaged, and assassinated several zombies on her way back to the main group. Cyrrus took a rusty spear to the ribs and responded with a scream of holy light that disintegrated the offending corpse. The owl, trying to be helpful, picked up a large stone and dropped it at a zombie fighting Tark — nearly braining the monk until he ducked beneath his opponent and let the rock cave in the creature's skull instead.

A second fireball into the smoke cloud finished the stragglers. They opened the first chest. Fëanon found himself staring at his own corpse, crushed and crammed inside. He stumbled backward, babbling, eyes wide — the vision driving him briefly to the edge of madness. Tark peered in, saw only a normal skeleton, and fished out a potion of diminutiveness and a gold incense censer. Once Fëanon recovered his wits, he determined the censer could summon an air elemental with the correct incense.

The second chest was pinned under rubble — and turned out to be a mimic, which devoured the unseen servant sent to free it. The group collapsed the rest of the tower on top of the creature and followed the glowing stones back to camp.

## Into Vallaki

Morning came as it always did in Barovia: mist, drizzle, and a pale suggestion of sunlight. The group broke camp and took the Svalich road toward Vallaki, keeping to the path. Through the trees they caught a glimpse of a vast dark lake at the foot of the mountains. Ireena said she had heard tales of dark things beneath those waters.

The sounds of battle reached them before the town did — the clash of weapons and crack of muskets. Cyrrus sent his owl ahead and it reported a horde of over fifty zombies pressed against the main gate. The defenders had the situation in hand, pouring musket fire from the stone walls while pikemen stabbed through the bars, well beyond reach. The real threat stood apart from the carnage: Gowain, the Shadow Abbot, preaching the glory of Strahd to no one in particular.

Gowain turned as the group approached and smiled. Tark came running up the road waving Gowain's wolf-skin hat, calling out to him. In his arrogance, Gowain assumed the halfling had come to return it out of fear. He held out his hand. The instant it extended, Tark shadowstepped away — and a lance of explosive fire streaked past where he had been standing. Fëanon's fireball detonated behind Gowain, turning the zombie horde to ash and flash-drying the mud outside the gate. Gowain was knocked forward by the blast but teleported to safety, choosing not to engage.

## The Prisoners

The group approached the gate with as much fanfare as they could manage — cantrips and holy light blazing. The guards were astonished, having just witnessed a single spell annihilate a small army. Seeing Ireena of Barovia among them, and the three children they escorted, the captain of the guard — Boris Borison — swung the gate wide and insisted the group meet the Burgomaster.

Ireena took her leave at the gate, heading to her uncle's house. She thanked the group and promised payment if they visited the toymaker's shop in the coming days, then departed with the rescued children. The group continued past the stockyard and the coffinmaker's shop to the town centre, where a large plaza stood adorned with wilting decorations proclaiming the "Wolf's Head Jamboree." In the centre of the square was a stage with five figures locked in stocks — men, women, and a child — wearing oversized donkey-head effigies and left out in the rain. Some of them had clearly died from exposure.

The group asked Boris why these people were being punished. He replied that they were malcontents spreading ill cheer. Buumi's face went dark. The group stormed the stage. Patches and Cyrrus picked the locks in seconds. Boris panicked but had no desire to cross swords with what appeared to be extraordinarily powerful heroes. Fëanon put an arm around the captain's shoulders and whispered into his mind not to resist.

Izek, the Burgomaster's enforcer, arrived with five soldiers and demanded they stop. As he spoke, a creature of pure flame erupted from a nearby brazier — coaxed forth by Tark using the power of his ring. The guards froze. Not knowing what to make of a being of living fire, Izek and his men backed away. Tark leapt forward and began play-fighting the elemental — badly — to buy time for the prisoners to escape the plaza. The moment they were out of sight, he dismissed it with a theatrical flourish, pretending to deal the killing blow.

## The Burgomaster

Izek, impressed despite himself, demanded the group accompany him to the Burgomaster. They had already been heading there. Not appreciating the escort, the group made it clear that his five guards would not be enough and he should adjust his tone. Put in his place, Izek led them to the Burgomaster's manor, pausing to point out the Bluewater Inn before continuing on.

Izek left them in the foyer and went upstairs to announce them. The group immediately began snooping. Cyrrus disguised himself as Boris and opened every door on the ground floor. Patches crept upstairs to eavesdrop on Izek's conversation with the Burgomaster. Cyrrus stumbled into a tea party — eight women enjoying pastries — and bluffed his way through a brief exchange with the lady of the manor before finding the kitchens and convincing the cook to bring a full dinner to the den for "guests of the Burgomaster."

From her hiding spot, Patches overheard the Burgomaster expressing eager interest in these powerful newcomers as potential allies. She returned to the den ahead of him. Vargas arrived moments later, bright-eyed and babbling about fighting Strahd and an upcoming festival of the sun. While he talked, Patches excused herself to the rest room and instead slipped up to the library, where she pocketed several spell scrolls and a handful of rare books.

It was immediately obvious to everyone that the Burgomaster was unhinged — a man grasping at straws to save his town from a threat he could not comprehend.
