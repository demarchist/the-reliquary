Tark awakens in his Tree Fort, in the predawn light to the sounds of shouting and screaming

He leaps to his feet and scans the Valley, seeing dark shapes of giant bats circling the town, their undersides illuminated by flashes of hurled Alchemist's fire from their riders.

Goblins.

Tark calls on Vaketh and with his prosthetic arm and eyes glowing red, leaps into the night sky, flying toward the conflict.

Cirrus is awoken by Topsy and quickly given a report.

With his network of acolytes Cirrus begins to get a steady stream of information on the attack and the disposition of the enemy raid

The town is currently assaulted by several dozen Goblin batriders though reports quickly begin to arrive of boulders being hurled at the Orcs from the darkness of the Evermoor by unknown assailants; likely giants

He gets a report that the Dwarves are locking down the Keep and gunning down Bats from the walls and the Paladins are mustering to charge to the town in support

He has no word of Feanon but hears of a red streak of light coming from the forest near Tark's Dojo and guesses his friend is on the way

Cirrus keeps the acolytes moving and the information flowing and summons Criserrei, his Planetar ally in her Seraphim form

The Celestial destroyer begins shooting the Goblins from the sky with her radiant bow

Patches is awoken by Mr. Pickles informing her there's some kind of attack in town. 

He also warns her that a group of patrons came in the night before and didn't get rooms, they stayed in the Common Room.

Patches sprints from her Sanctum, through her secret tunnels and up into The Establishment

She races through the Common Room and sees the group of Patrons

Two seem to be sleeping while two others are rolling dice to pass the time, except one of the sleepers has a good view on the backroom doors and stiffens slightly as Patches rushes through them.

One of the dice rollers has eyes on her too and they go a little wide in recognition

She spots them spot her spotting them

The seemingly sleeping Gnome bolts up, flipping the table over as she grabs a huge and exquisitely crafted crossbow from underneath and the human with her leaps from the booth pulling daggers from her boots

The two dice players spin out of their booth, swinging their weapons in practiced unison; the human going high with a spear and the dwarf low with a flail

Patches flips between the attackers and they miss their target

Jackie, behind the bar, pulls out a Rockseeker 200 - the simple Boomstick model kept behind the bar and unloads a blast into the face of the dagger wielder

Jackie then cries out in shock at the powerful weapon and proclaims he "really likes it!"

Enchanted bolts clip Patches and embed into the back wall

The rapid-firing Gnome assassin is then surprised when Mr. Pickles leans out of his trapdoor in the wall and garrotes her with a wire, pulling her back with him into the recess and out of view.

Patches hurls a smoke bomb to the ground and vanishes

The two remaining assassins turn back to back in the smoke, ready to keep fighting

Meanwhile in his tower, Feanon is alerted to the attack and gathers his two combat apprentices,

The new third; Sinya, is told to remain behind as Feanon has yet to interview the young elf lady

Feanon, Ruthir, and his young cousin don their battlemage equipment and teleport to the center of town

They find themselves in the thick of a Goblin Raid and they waste no time beginning to blast the attackers from the dark pre-dawn skies.

The city guard was warned the night before that *something *was coming so the guard are not caught unawares and bows hum with rapid shots

The occasional crack of a thundering Dwarven arquebus splits the air.

Most of the noise is from shouting and coordinating within the city guard and civilian support brigades

JmJm rides from his Theater with a cadre of supporters that engage the goblins and attempt to put out fires, rescue people and add dramatic sound effects at critical times (the work of foley artists)

Tark flies in above the town and spies movement along the Trade road at the East and West gates

Both gates are manned by guards and engaged in fighting the flying raiders

Tark spots a flash of light and then another in front of the gates as dark figures appear flanked by hulking forms

He cannot see who the figures are from this distance but there are flashes of green light from each and the East and West gates are disintegrated to dust

From the twilight shadows ride dozens upon dozens of Goblin Warg Riders, right through the holes in the gates

The dark caped figures vanish in another display of powerful magic, leaving their Armored Ogre allies behind to charge through the gates with the Wargs

Taking up the rear of the whole assault are two Hellhounds that stay to secure the open Gates

Tark realizes his friends in the town square will be pincered

he knocks a Goblin rider from his bat and then grabs the beast, snapping its wings and rides it down in a tumble to the ground where he can see JmJm and Feanon fighting

Tark quickly warns the Wizard and Bard about what he witnessed and asks where everyone else is

Feanon notes the fires being spread by the bat riders and messages Doc, asking for rain

Moments later, clouds begin to form and the first drops of rain splash down

They look over and see the first floor of the Establishment filled with smoke and they rush over

Tark shoves the door open with his powerfully glowing hand and the heavy oak doors slam wide, dispersing what was left of the fast thinning smoke

The two assassins, back to back, see that their window to assassinate Patches has closed and they throw smoke bombs of their own and flee

Patches slinks back into view

A corpse falls out of Mr Pickles trapdoor in the wall - the gnome.

Another corpse is on the floor, headless from the double barreled shotgun behind the bar

Patches goes to Jackie and demands to know how he knew to use the shotgun, he placates her by confirming that he is just a regular human and the device was similar to a Crossbow so he guessed (correctly)

The group exchanges quick words and takes stock of what is happening as patches quickly pats down the corpse

Someone put a very pricey hit on her and she recognizes the gnome at least as a Zhentarim assassin of some renown.

Gibmaker Gibby.  She also recognized the human spear wielder as Patch Cassidy, a hired killer

Both Zhentarim

Patches thinks this attack was opportunistic and not related to the Goblins and says as much

Just as they turn to rush back to the town square to meet the Warg charge, Patches hears a wet cough in the walls and pokes her head inside

She sees a badly wounded Mr. Pickles

She pulls her trusty valet from the wall and calls over medics to get him patched up and sent to the Fane hospital

She rushes into Claudine's Alchemy shop and grabs a healing potion, feeding it to Mr Pickles as he's carted away to safety

Horns blow from the attacking Wargs and the stomping Ogres shake the ground

The group stands in the town square as they are assaulted from both sides and above by the Goblin war party

The raiders are met with the well organized city guard, JmJm's militia, a horde of woodland creatures sent by Doc and the core of the Faerun Defense Force

Civilians that find themselves pressed by the attackers are quickly backed up by charging deer, or find their attackers shot by the hovering Seraphim, or deftly slain by a passing Patches, pummeled by Tark, slashed by JmJm or blasted by Feanon

Tark leaps forward, his prosthetic arm blazing with red energy and punches one of the Ogres through a nearby building

The other 7 bear down on the Monk but find that their heavy strikes are far too slow to hit the nimble halfing

Patches rushes in against the Wargs, hurling lightning and stun bombs and vanishes into the fray in a flurry of blades 

Feanon and JmJm turn to meet the other charge

Two dozen Wargs and 7 Ogres rush forward, screaming battle cries that quickly change to cries of surprise and anguish as Feanon causes an Ice Wall to erupt in their path, immediately stalling the charge

JmJm pulls on a mysterious glove from his past and begins crushing and hurling ogres and wargs

The Seraphim continues it's thrumming assault of searing arrows and it appears that the Batriders taste for battle breaks.

With a triple blast from one of their horns, the flock breaks and flees south, to the Evermoor

The Paladins charge into the town

The Wargs and Ogres are being slaughtered and with the horn blasts from the bat riders, they too turn and flee back out the destroyed gates before breaking south to the Evermoor, harried by the pursuing Paladins

Tark, JmJm, Patches and Feanon breathe easier in town and quickly turn to assist their civilians in putting out fires and finishing off the last of the raiders

Cirrus receives a report that his friends have met the charge and stopped it cold and the Paladins are charging down from the Keep

He is also told that both gates were disintegrated along the Trade way and then covered by Hellhounds

This piques his interest

He knows his friends have the raid in hand and the Warlock heads out to investigate who may be behind this assault

He ambushes the two hellhounds at the back of the retreating pack, killing them and then True Polymorphs himself into one of the nearby slain Wargs and rushes after the fleeing raiders

The pack swings wide of the Orc settlement and heads south as fast as they can, deep into the Evermoor

Despite his Warg-shape, it's hard going for Cirrus and he can hardly keep up through the fetid marsh, leaping from fallen tree to waterlogged island and splashing through the shallow waters

Eventually though, the marshy ground solidifies somewhat and the pack arrives at a large island in the moor with an ancient ruined watchtower atop it

He hears the name "The Withered Hill"

Gathered around the decrepit place is a large force of Goblinoids

Several hundred goblins with dozens of Hill giants, Wargs, Giant Bats and armored Ogres are assembled here, far, far more than just attacked the town

The returning raiders filter back in to the main force but Cirrus spots three Goblin Booyaghs/bosses with their personal warriors head past the small hill, to the far waters edge of the island

Cirrus follows as a respectable distance after being snapped at by some of the other wargs and he slinks around the long way with his tail between his legs

He gets close enough to listen to the conversation and then spots *who *the Goblin leaders are talking with - a great Black Dragon laying in the water of the swamp like a great crocodile

Cirrus recognizes the dragon's name spoken by the Goblins: Ancalagon

The same dragon that attacked patrols in the Evermoor some months ago

Cirrus discovers that the Dragon and his forces are working with another, commanded by a Devil named **Beucephelus **and that the Dragon's raid was to keep the barony's attention on the south, and potentially lure defenders out into the swamp for easy pickings

Cirrus decides to take a gamble and shifts his form into that of a Devil and approaches the conversation to try and pry out some more information

The Dragon is cautious but ultimately convinced that Cirrus is working for Beucephelus and asks why the Ziggurat in the north has not been completed as it is past the appointed time - The Wizard (Feanon) is not dead and has been spotted in town (much to the dragon's confusion)

Cirrus answers truthfully that they do not know and that he needs the Goblin leadership to come with him for that very reason.

The dragon is suspicious but ultimately agrees, not wanting to fail in their mission

Cirrus walks away from the conversation with more questions and leads the Goblin Booyaghs and their bodyguards to a secluded spot at the foot of the Withered hill

There he casts Demiplane and opens a door into the hill and the curious goblins follow

As he opens the door, he feels a pull on his soul and pressure on his magic and sees the door in front of him twist and crack and a skull can be seen pressing against the door, but then vanishes... 

Once inside, he closes the door and Planeshifts away just as one of the Booyagh's gets wise and shouts at him to stop his spellcasting

He leaves the Goblins trapped in the pocket dimension

The warlock appears in the center of the Barony, just outside the Establishment, looking like his normal self

He feels another pull and the pressure increases and he staggers a little, heart beating faster...

Meanwhile, back in town the city guard has been fully mustered and the gates quickly re-fabricated by the Dwarves (not as good as before, but Iron is Iron)

Patches has spent over an hour in disguise as the homely human woman Nora, helping around the barony and investigating the band of assassins that accosted her

She determines that the band filtered in one by one the day before and took up in the common room of the Establishment, not renting rooms

One of the assassins (and survivors) - Patch Cassidy was bragging at a Zhent outpost in Nesme that he had picked up a contract for a "boatload of silver" to take out a Herald, though at the time the listener thought he meant a literal herald for some lord.

Tracking this further, she gets a name - the contract came to the Silvertongues of Baldur's gate, but commissioned from a human Rogue named Morik, in Luskan.

The contract is still active and Patch and one other, a Dwarf named **Irehide **survived

She returns to her friends and reveals the intel

The FDF gathers in the Establishment, including the B team of Maximus, Bohd, Chani, Gneiss, Ezmerelda, Jin and Ruthir while they receive a message from Li that she is coordinating efforts from the security of the keep

The Paladins are gathering the dead to cast Gentle Repose and revive as many as they can with the hoards of Diamonds being purchased from the Deep Gnomes of Blingdenstone

Bohd wants to lead a pursuit into the Evermoor with 30 veterans, 100 orcs and the two Giant allies of the Barony but Feanon stops them, pointing out that whoever is behind these attacks seems be intentionally keeping the Barony's attention South

JmJm agrees and points out that the woodland creatures Doc has been speaking to are avoiding the woods to the north because of "the bad rock that grows"

This convinces Feanon that the North is the true threat and he thinks about the Chair/Person trapped in Cirrus' demiplane.

The FDF has their forces stand their ground and reinforce their defenses and they send Chani off to the north to scout

Chani the monk speeds from the Establishment, past Cirrus as he Planeshifts to town.

The group sees the Warlock appear, and stagger in pain and the group moves out of the Establishment to their friend to inquire

Cirrus brushes it off, but asks if anyone else has been feeling this strange pain (no one has)

Cirrus then tells the group everything he discovered

At the mention of the Devil Beucephelus, Feanon perks up.  He recognizes the name and flicking through a book on the 9 Hells, finds the passage he's looking for

Beucephelus is a Narzugon Commander in the Doomstar Legion, the mercenary army of the Archdevil Mathias Doomstar, lord of Dis, the 2nd layer of Hell.

They have powerful foes arrayed against them, and Feanon laments their lack of coin(or souls) to pay off the mercenaries

As they talk with Cirrus, Patches hears two civilians calling out, looking for their loved ones - a fairly common occurrence right now

But the perceptive rogue hears the two women find one another and talk about **Bob and Chez**, their sons

Apparently both had been training for the High Sun Foot Race and after the attack was thwarted, ran off to the north to do the festival race regardless of the current circumstances

The group moves over to the women and after a quick exchange, scrys on the two boys and sees them running through woods to the north, a Wood Elf in pursuit

Feanon recognizes the Wood Elf as an ally - Menriel Boughrunner, from the groups time in Silverymoon

Feanon says the group will retrieve them shortly and questions Buumi why they would do this race to begin with

It is a local religious festival with locals running to the top of the Red Hill and then cliff-diving into Lake Selunia to show their courage and vigor to the Morning Lord

Cirrus laments again that he is *tired *from the morning attack and needs to rest but the group finds themselves pressed for time

They send runners to the Orc town to NOT pursue into the Evermoor and Chani and Menriel are already heading north but the group decides to head north themselves to ensure the kids safe return

Cirrus remembers, and says that the Dragon mentioned that the Ziggurat was primed or overdue for a cataclysmic event

At that moment, Cirrus suffers another episode, but this time the whole group witnesses it.

They see a shimmering in the air and reality itself seems to crack as a screaming human skull seems to try and break through the barriers of reality

Everyone turns to the spellcasters and demands "what was that?"

It begins to click into place for Feanon

Feanon sighs and asks if Cirrus has checked on the Chair/Person

Cirrus says he has not

The group notes the burns, cracking flesh and marks on Cirrus' fingertips and they question the injuries, but he brushes it off

Feanon read the Zhengian Tome of Creation and then shunted the curse from himself to the Chair Person and then imprisoned the person in a Demiplane

(the group questions if cursing the "person" is any different than smashing a chair)

The creation of the Ziggurat consumed the life force of the Chair Person, slowly turning him into...something and now that the Ziggurat is complete 

The attack was to ensure its undisturbed completion

...but *something *didnt happen that the attackers were expecting and now they are waiting, confused.

Feanon goes over everything he has ever heard about Zhengyi and his Tomes of Creation and what they are seeing with the Demiplane

Only one creature matches the information at hand

There is a feral Demilich trapped in the pocket dimension and it is trying to get out…
