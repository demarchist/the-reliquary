The group battles the massive Psionic Turtle-like creatures.

Liara manages to affect one with a Fear spell, allowing the rest of the group to gang up and surround the other, slaying it in short order.

The other, still fearful of the Cleric of Zalaam, flees into the surrounding scrub desert.

They then gather and butcher the creature - a Musulhuf - for it’s bones, armor plates, meat and organs.

The group figures that someone would likely pay good money for this thing, or at the very least, provide the group with some raw crafting materials.

They then push on.

It becomes evident that they will not make it to the city that day and the group begins to look for shelter for the night.

Cirrus actually seems to accept what is happening and decides to sleep.

He refuses to go down naturally though and Snorbul is forced to choke him out.

The next day, the group makes it to the outskirts of the city, a ramshackle looking place along the coast of the scrub plains here.

At the heart of the city though is a grand citadel of ancient stone and brass, clearly of ancient saurian make.

While the place has clearly been kept up with well, modern constructions and modifications abound.

It is obvious that no Saurians have lived here for some time.

On the outskirts the group spots a wandering Khonsfa beetle mount with a palanquin atop it.

Moving in, they find a teenage girl waking up from a slumber.

Her mount apparently wandered away from her fathers trade/marriage convoy to the south.

The group endeavors to help the girl and return her to her family estate (for a hefty reward).

Her name is Humdia

There’s something strange about her story and no one thinks she just wandered away.

The group pushes through the slums, Dust Town, and make it to the walls of the citadel.

The group notes a distinct lack of guards in this part of town.

At the head of a small convoy of Beetles and bringing in the Musulhuf to trade, the guards let the group in without issue.

They head through the city, stopping for some Soup at Stew’s Stews in the Souk district.

Moving through the ancient but expertly made saurian streets and past great buildings of stone and bronze, the group finds themselves in the nice part of town.

Surrounded by estates and villas, the group is led by the wealthy girl to a beautiful walled house.

The guard outside is convinced to fetch the lady of the house.

Once she arrives, the group presents her daughter back to her.

She is quite surprised.

The annoying daughter is welcomed back into the house and the group is offered a dinner in the villa as well as a deal on lodging elsewhere in the city and a monetary reward.

The group looks at one another smiling, thinking their luck in this place might be turning.

They head into the estate to go to dinner.
