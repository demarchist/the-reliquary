The group takes some time to recover from the explosion.

They debate attacking The Lady in White, but decide against it, not knowing her purpose and not willing to take the fight into the sky.  They postpone assaulting her for now.

They know that they are in a trap, and that the Non-detection spell from Cirrus wont hide them forever.

Feanon decides that now is the time to try something he has been working on - The Spell Advanced Contingency.

He pulls out one of the remaining enchanted emeralds looted from Baba Lysaga in Barovia and uses it to fuel the powerful spell - casting Teleport with a contingency to save them if the criteria are met.

Feeling much more secure with a lifeline, the group relaxes a little.

They decide to finish checking out this floor of the facility before heading deeper into the factory and head out after a short rest.

They make it back to the large diamond shaped chamber with the strange crystal coating and begin to thoroughly inspect it, anticipating some kind of trap.

They are not disappointed and Gundren is almost vaporized.

They realize that the entire room is some kind of trash disposal system, releasing a gas which causes a flash disintegration of anything non-metal or magical

The strange crystal coating over everything is soft to the touch (it is plastic) and unlike anything they have ever seen.

They scavenge a decent amount of metal from the incinerator as well as a magical box containing a 4 sided spell-rune.

They move on from the incinerator

They backtrack back to the first chamber of this level; checking the room that had the Beholder Alghouls (and finding their eggs).

The group makes short work of the Alghoul Beholder hatchlings

The group then moves to the stairwell down to the lower levels

Here they come across the strange dark entity in the stairwell and it calls to them, attempting psychic manipulation and fear projections.

Feanon is dropped catatonic by a psychic assault but the others realize what is happening and attack the dark entity.

Though it is indistinct at first, as magic corrales it, the creature takes a vaguely equine shape.

With the creature identified, the group focuses their fire and the thing is summarily destroyed.

The dark staircase down is no longer supernaturally ominous and the group descends.

They descend far farther than any of the other staircases and after a good hundred or more feet, they make it to the next level.

They find a large derelict hallway, its ceiling hanging strangely in places but shored up with recent construction and repair efforts.

The ground shows a great deal of recent traffic and the group follows some of the tracks to the back corner of the hall, a seeming dead end.

On closer inspection, they find a section of the wall has recently been removed and replaced and they remove some bricks, finding an alcove behind.

They determine that *something *is in the alcove, but it is invisible.

The group spends their time dispelling the magic until finally, they make the thing in the alcove appear.

It is a huge and intricate work of artifice.

They pore over the thing until they come to the conclusion that it is a very large bomb.

Based on the size and how it utilizes the alchemy, Patches determines that it was likely supplied by chemicals from the store-room above.

Based on the size of this bomb and the store room, this bomb is likely 1 of 3.

They get the scent of the bomb and then head deeper into this floor, intent on at least finding all the bombs and then deciding what to do about them (several theories are floated, like teleporting the bomb away).

They move down the hallway until they come across a grand set of Brass doors.

They open the grand set of doors and find a huge automated foundry

The walls and ceiling of the place are covered in machinery and equipment and it's clear that it has seen recent use.

Braided cords of precious metals snake from the machinery to the center of the room where something massive is obscured by a twisting mass of ferro-fluid.

The group tentatively moves forward, intent on inspecting the space but not wanting to alert the strange blob in the center of the room.

They realize that the thing is an amalgam of Sourcework cores and the same strange black “fluid” that several other things have been made of in this dungeon.

As the mass shifts and begins to notice their presence, Feanon thinks to pull out the Lodestone and he opens it.

It is ripped from his hand and pulled into the mass of ferrofluid where the Lodestone “clicks” into place into something.

The Ferrofluid immediately starts to grow and react as whatever it was engulfing is turned on.

The thing is feeding on something powerful the group can't see.

Cirrus moves in and touches the creature, Planeshifting a huge amount of its mass to another Plane.

The thing immediately reacts, attacking the group.

They counterattack, finding Sourcework cores within the ferrofluid and destroying them.

The group gathers around the abomination so that Cirrus’ Nondetection covers them. This means that every core that's destroyed, blows up and showers the group with debris causing some minor injuries.

Before long, the amalgam of ferrofluid and Sourcework cores is destroyed and the strange dark material turns to dust revealing a huge Machina underneath.

Laying in the center of the Sourcework forge is an ancient Saurian Colossus, its massive Sourcework Power Core having been re-ignited by the Lodestone.

Feanon retrieves the Lodestone, powering down the energy core.

Gundren and Feanon spend the next two hours working to remove the Sourcework Core and after some delicate operations, they manage to separate the Beach-ball sized power-plant from the intricate machinery.

Gundren laments that they cannot take more of the Colossus but alas, they are nearly overburdened with the salvage gathered from the place.

They look around the Foundry, inspecting it.

They discover another grand set of doors leading to yet another large chamber, as well as molds, smelters, forges, conveyors and crucibles all automated to produce machina parts.

It appears that the current configuration is to mass produce Power Cores and Gate pieces.

They find another alcove and another invisible bomb in this room, hidden behind a newly constructed metal wall.

In one corner, Feanon finds an Obsidian Crystal “tome”.  It operates like a small library complete with filing and ordering systems, but appears to be empty.

He takes it with him and the group turns their attention toward the large set of doors to the next chamber.

They open the intricate metal doors, showing a depiction of the Ringed Veil and Saurian empire.

Inside this room, they see a vast hangar with row after row of intricate looking obsidian machina covered in arrays of precious metals and glowing sourcework gems.

Around the room are dozens of pedestals that look like something large was once attached - Feanon realizes these are the docks for the Stasis and Cloning vats moved from the place.

And across the hangar, disassembled on the floor into radii, is a Ringed Veil

The group cautiously moves through the hangar as a clump, investigating and checking for traps.

They find no traps, but determine the Obsidian Machina to be some kind of database.

The group is all on edge.  Why haven't the bombs gone off? What is the Lady in White waiting for?

Feanon connects the crystal from the previous room as an interface and after a short search, finds the Address to Faerun in the system and commits it to memory along with 4 other addresses on the Prime Material Plane.

With the address home secured, they turn their attention to the Ringed Veil.

Patches spots some movement in the previous chamber and warns the group.

They rush to the main door and heave it closed, unwilling to take any chances with whatever may have slipped in behind them.

Gundren moves in to begin looking the Veil over.  He does a first pass and everything looks ok, though with the gate partially disassembled he can't be sure.

The group smells burning and they look to the metal doors of the Hangar and note the center beginning to grow red hot and smolder.

The group moves into position, each person grabbing a piece of the gate to prepare to teleport, not wanting to wait for whatever is coming through the door.

Gundren reiterates that he can't be sure the Veil is safe and Feanon turns to talk with him, but notes that all of his companions are frozen mid action.

Feanon looks to the doors and sees that the center has slagged away, revealing a gaping, molten hole.

On the other side of the door, Feanon sees Vecna watching him.

Realizing that he is in a Time Stop, Feanon activates his contingency.

Vecna calls out “Feanon, this is your last chance.  Join me or Die!”.  But the Wizard, his companions, and the Ringed Veil are gone…

The group arrives with a flash of light and thundercrack of displaced air to Iyum and the Golden Tower.

Patches leads the group in a rush out to a Southwest facing balcony.  A few minutes later, the shockwave of a blast reaches Iyum, causing the city to tremble and the clouds to be pushed away.

The group looks to one another in awe, sure that the shockwave they just felt was the blast from the bombs in the Machina Factory…
