Snorbul and Thorna arrive, having seen the plume of dust and smoke from the Barony proper

Snorbul appears to be healed of his dismemberment - the limbs replaced by roots and stone

The others begin to question the gnome, but the shifting stone from the massive creature in the hole gets their attention

The group looks down into the crater and watch as the smashed ziggurat slowly begins to crawl from the crevasse with a thousand arms and tentacles

They quickly discuss their options, estimating far less than an hour before the Dragon gets to the Barony from the Evermoor

As they talk, Tark feels a pull from his hip; A faint heartbeat.

He focuses on it and realizes something is calling to him from within his Bag of Holding.

He opens it an looks inside and see the Flint knife he took from Li Xian when he slew the Oni

The knife that killed his parents

He removes the knife from his pouch and tells the group what he feels

He feels the will of Zhengyi nearby, wondering if the Red Robed entity (Corpsetaker) may somehow be within the blade…

Buumi offers to smash and smite the knife, feeling the evil emanating from it

Feanon picks up the knife and feels the transplanar power within it and wonders if he could maybe cut his way into the Shadowfell with it

Patches recognizes the blade as something akin to her old cursed weapon; Stabby

With the atropal creature below providing insight, prayers to the gods and the arcane knowledge of the group, they know they must go to the Shadowfell to truly fight this thing; where the bulk of the entity resides

But they have no means to get there, their power is spent.

JmJm steps forward with an idea

He proposes that they free the Aldjinn they rescued from Al’askar, the one trapped within the slab of crystal

They group is hesitant, they do not wish to unleash a greater evil upon the world just to stop this thing

They talk it over and eventually decide upon a plan.

JmJm brings forth the crystal and calls to the Aldjinn

 After a brisque negotiation, Cirrus pulls out his Well of Many worlds and opens a portal to Hades for the Aldjinn to be freed into

The Aldjinn, happy simply to be freed of its prison and into a plane that matches its own alignment, adheres to the deal and revitalizes the magic users (though not completely)

The last they see of the ancient Al’Askarian spirit is the horned, serpentine, fiery, rune-covered looking creature addressing a pack of nearby mephits and proclaiming itself their new god

Cirrus picks up the Portal, closing it

Revitalized by the powerful entity, the group turns their attention back to the approaching Ziggurat 

They plane shift to the Shadowfell.

The necrotic cold of the place immediately begins to gnaw at their life force and Buumi enacts an Aura of life to counteract it

Below the group, in the Earthquake caused crevasse, a fleshy monstrosity can be seen where the Ziggurat would be, its true nature revealed fully in this dark world

The Gargantuan thing is a mound of flesh, limbs and tendrils with a huge umbilical cord reaching into the sky to the far image of Atropos in the sky, the dark planetoid wreathed in an orange fiery halo

The flesh of the ziggurat pulses and undulates and several distinct creatures can be seen at the center, grafted together into an abomination

A Storm Giant, White Dragon, Demilich and Atropal are all conjoined into the massive entity that presents itself as the Ziggurat in the material world.

Not fifty feet away from the group around the edge of the crevasse in the dark realm are three figures looking down upon the fleshy monster.

Two huge many-armed monstrosities and a ghostly floating figure they recognize.


The servant of Zhengyi; the ghostly Corpsetaker


Focused on the Atropal abomination, the Grafted monsters and Corpsetaker do not notice the group

Patches hears the ghostly form cast a sending spell and then speak

It says “It has no mind, it is feral.  What should I do?”

The group does not let the moment pass and do not wait for a response and the group quickly attacks Corpsetaker and its two minions, taking them by surprise

The trio was not expecting to be accosted in the Shadowfell and the group proves to be far more mighty than the last time they crossed paths

Half go for Corpsetaker while the rest go for the Ziggurat

The group quickly slays the two many-armed monstrosities: Oni that have been grafted with other beings to increase their power and bound within porcelain masks (which the group shatters)

Their power was nothing compared to Snorbul’s new blade, taken from the Deathlord of Vecna, its edge burning through flesh and severing limbs with ease.

Thorna calls down lightning blast after blast on the Ziggurat, burning the Atropal flesh away

Corpsetaker fares no better than its grafted Oni minions and is pummeled apart by Tark and his Veketh empowered arm

The Flint blade no longer has a heartbeat, but can feel the presence and direction of its owner

Corpsetaker’s essence flees to the far east, to its waiting phylactery.

The group turns to the Grafted monstrosity,and focus on he amalgam of Giant, Dragon and dead flesh

The thing births forth a deluge of wyrmling-shaped abominations made from writhing atropal but the things are quickly destroyed before they can get near anyone

The Storm giant of the Grafted hurls blasts of lightning at the group while the grafted Dragon breathes sheets of ice and the many fleshy arms of the ziggurat hurl boulders and swipe with foul claws.

As the Umbilical of the Atropal is finally burned away by a Disintegrate from Feanon, the Demilich becomes visible, moving amongst the sea of twisted flesh.

Its eyes flash and it teleports one of the group into its pocket plane “stomach” to be digested

The group see the Demilich and focus their fire just as it scoops up another of the group, “consuming” them

The Demilich however, is overwhelmed and the skull shatters

The two group members in the pocket plane find themselves deposited back into the shadowfell.

The entire Ziggurat begins to shake and the grafted Storm Giant and Dragon wail in agony

Thousands of screaming mouths appear over the flesh of the entity and the Atropal Umbilical can be seen beginning to grow back down from the sky

Patches spots it first - a small black orb moving amongst the flesh of the Ziggurat near the center

She points it out and looses a volley of enchanted bolts from her new crossbow, scoring a hit and throwing a shower of sparks

Feanon realizes that they have found the Phylactery of this *thing *and calls it out* *and they unleash everything they have into the Phylactery

Many strikes have no effect as the powerful orb shrugs off all but the most intense blows

Under the unrelenting assault of the group though, the Orb is shattered and the Phylactery destroyed

The wailing ceases and the massive grafted Dragon and Storm Giant atop the ziggurat of flesh fall limp and dead and the Umbilical turns to ash in the dark sky

The gargantuan mound begins to slump and turn grey and rotten and the group backs away with the fragments of the Phylactery in hand.

They all gather around the life aura of Buumi, shielding themselves against the necrotic darkness of the Plane

A cursory inspection reveals a Black Sourcestone shell engraved with runes with a small chunk of Prismeum in the core.

Sourcestone is somehow making it from Al’Askar to Faerun

The group knows of only two sources of Prismeum: Netherese Mythals and a long lost Svirfneblin/Selunite ceremony that only they know of.

They have no time to dwell on this mystery with an ancient Dragon and its servants bearing down on their keep.

Thorna calls upon her divine power and opens a gate back to the material plane and the group leaves the Shadowfell…

**Part 2**

Warmth rushes back to them on the Material plane

the flesh of the ziggurat is rotting fast and crumbling back into the crevasse

The group rushes from the Red Hill back to the Barony, racing to get to the keep before Ancalagon gets there

They can see the Black Dragon flying over the Evermoor toward their castle, it is not alone and a cloud of indistinct forms can be seen flying with him

The group call upon their mounts just as they get to the base of the hill and then gallop across the farmland and past the outlying settlements

As they make the main settlement, they come across a group of their own outriders

The guards say they are conducting one last sweep for civilians - everyone is sheltering in the keep proper

With no civilians to shepherd, they continue on through town and to the switchback road leading up to the Keep’s gate.

Just as they begin the ascent, the ground forces of Ancalagon reach the Barony wall and quickly scale it

The first Goblin gets a Crossbow Bolt for its trouble and the next a Thundercannon shot, but they keep coming and the group retreats to their keep atop Thunder Bluff.

The portcullis slams down behind them as they enter and they see their full guard arrayed for defense with Bohd at its head, his Wyvern nowhere in sight

Dwarven arquebus wielders and archers are on the wall and the veteran melee and Bolg the mountain giant hold the gate

On each major tower, a Delzoun Fire Cannon is manned by a team and each begins to track the approaching dragon, the rotating wand-barrels beginning to spin

Down below, on the edge of the Evermoor a tribe of Hill Giants and Ogres strides forth into the river, crossing it quickly to get to the far bank where the Orc village is

The Orcs leap from cover, roaring challenges and unleashing volleys of javelins and arrows into the giants.

The massive creatures cannot resist the challenge and become embroiled in a battle to get out of the rushing river but the Orcs hold them there, forcing them to stay in the difficult terrain where they are cut down one by one, but at tremendous cost.


In the keep, Surtr the fire Giant waits in the Courtyard for where he’s needed while the paladins and clerics of Helm and Selune rush around ensuring their medical supplies are ready to be doled out

The great Dragon swoops over the last stretch of the Evermoor surrounded by a cloud of Goblin Batriders creating a moving shield to protect him

Patches and Gundren both note that the Dragon is wearing a framework of metal armor, embedded with dark gemstones.  They recognize the artifice: Hollow Armor

The same design of armor that Jareem’s mate was cursed and enthralled with in Al’Askar by Vecna…

Ancalagon roars, shouting that his second assault will far far better than his first conflict with the group and the dragon vanishes, turning invisible

Down in the town, the ground forces of the Dragon gather at the road to the keep and begin to charge up the switchbacks, quickly tiring of the back and forth and climbing straight up

The group arrays themselves to defend their keep, with Patches and Gundren taking the main wall overlooking the Gate and everyone else taking to the top of the Keep proper to repel the Dragon

Tarks prosthetic glows red and he leaps into the air, taking the fight to the Batriders, breaking limbs and leaping from bat to bat, leaving them tumbling to the ground in his wake

Feanon unleashes a Deep Slumber in the flocks path, causing another dozen to tumble to their deaths, fast asleep

Cirrus unleashes a wall of force and dozens more smash into the invisible and unyielding wall

The dragon becomes visible again, having seen his fodder get caught and goes around, bypassing the spells and breathes a line of acid into the spellcasters melting flesh and stone

The gun crews see their target and open up on the Dragon and lines of fire blaze across the sky and smash into a shield surrounding Ancalagon

The gems of his armor shine brightly, the Hollow Armor taking the damage rather than his flesh

The dragon then dives, lunging at the spellcasters with tooth and claw

Cirrus tries to shield them with a Dome of Force but is counterspelled by the powerful dragon


On the wall, Patches gives orders to the nearby teams, having them boil oil and prepare bombs she hands out

She spots a single figure in the midst of the assaulting pack doing its best to hide and she shoots its mount from under it

The Doomstar Devastator falls to the ground and rolls to his feet just as Gundren unloads his Tundercannon into it, the shells exploding on the arcane shield of the Devil

A volley of crossbow bolts and other shots hammer down into the pack, many hitting the shield of the Devil

Gundren preps a surprise of his own and just as the Goblins, Ogres and Wargs make the last switchback, he hurls out a small grey bead.

The bead hits and erupts into a tidal wave of water, slamming the attackers to the ground and damn near drowning the lot

As the water cascades down the hill, the Goblins and Ogres struggle to their feet, peppered by shots from the wall, only to have firebombs and boiling oil hurled down onto their heads, killing all the Wargs and Goblins and horribly wounding the surviving armored ogres

The Doomstar devastator Thundersteps from his dead fodder to the wall near Gundren and unleashes a Disintegrate at the Dwarf, who hurls himself prone to avoid the beam, obliterating a section of wall instead.

All the nearby allied forces turn their weapons on the Devil and Patches rushes in to slay the enemy wizard, only to be stopped by a teleporting second Devil

 a Doomstar Legionnaire backs up the Devastator on the wall

The keep’s veterans rush in with shields and pikes to press the devils, but the Devils are otherworldly and immensely strong

Gundren and Patches focus on the spellcaster and Gundren makes a shot past the legionnaires shield, taking the head from the Devil mage.

The new devilish arrival clashes with Patches and Gundren, smashing both from the wall with his thunderous hammer while laughing about “Beucy” getting a new smile from Patches

A roar from the keep roof gets everyone’s attention and they see the Dragon assaulting the spellcasters, Gundren tosses an Iron Horn to Buumi and tells the Paladin to get up to the spellcasters and blow it

Surtr strides over to the Keep wall and begins to climb up to face the dragon

Buumi rushes to the roof with his wings just in time to see Feanon tossed aside like a ragdoll and the bloody forms of Cirrus and Tark on the ground

Buumi blows the Iron Horn

A ghostly Longship descends from the cloudy sky, oars moving and crewed by over two dozen ghostly berzerkers

As the ship coasts by the Dragon, dozens of spectral warriors vault over the side of the ship and assault the shocked Dragon

Buumi makes it to Tark, healing the bloody warrior just as Cirrus crawls over to the unconscious form of Feanon and heals him

The dragon is immediately put on the defensive by the sheer number of attackers and it rears up on its hind legs, its Hollow Armor letting out a dinful thunderclap that cracks the stone of the roof and staggers the ghosts

The tower guns let loose another fusillade into the shielded dragon and Ancalagon, seeing Surtr gain the roof, dives from the Keep and swoops down the bluff, using the Keep walls to shield himself from all but one of the Dwarven guns

Tark leaps in pursuit, falling on to the back of the Dragon and striking it

Ancalagon rolls, buffeting the Monk with his armored wings and knocking him out

The monk falls limp to the rocky cliff some sixty feet below…


Gundren, flat on his back in the courtyard from where he was thrown by the Doomstar Legionnaire, unloads his Thundercannon into the Devil just as the tower guns take aim and unleash a torrent of fire into him

The Devil roars in glee as the scorching rays do nothing to him but the roar cuts off as Patches makes the wall and dashes past, cutting his throat

On command from Captain Bohd, the castle gates open and the Veterans, Paladins and Bolg storm forth into the bloodied and reeling Ogres and Goblin foot soldiers 

Gundren and Patches both then rush to the keep to help against the dragon


Cirrus and Feanon limp to the edge of the keep and look down at the bloody body of Tark amongst the rocks

The dragon turns in mid-air, unable to resist and cackles with glee and reaches forth a clawed hand, sending out magic missiles to slay the unconscious Monk

Feanon counterspells the cruel attack and the dragon screams a frustrated curse, acid bubbling in its throat

Cirrus leaps from the battlement, farstepping to his unconscious ally and calling upon the healing light of Selune to bring him back from the brink of death.

Tark blinks blood encrusted eyes open, just in time for the great dragon to unleash an acid breath attack on him and Cirrus

They take cover amongst the rocks but are badly burned, Tark falls unconscious again

Down at the river bank, the Giants morale breaks as the Tower Guns that cannot hit the dragon turns on the brutes and unleashes a volley.

The river runs red with Ogre, Orc and Hill giant blood and more of the Giants are cut down as they flee, their massive bulk splashing into the red waters.

The Orcs let loose a“Waaaaaagh!” warcry that echoes across the Evermoor

Ancalagon screams in anger and denial seeing his assault completely stopped 

Just as the group arrays themselves against the Ancient Black Dragon, he wheels in the air and races away as fast as he can, vanishing into invisibility moments later

A calm falls over the Barony, broken only by the occasional dying scream of a Goblin, Giant, Ogre or Warg…
