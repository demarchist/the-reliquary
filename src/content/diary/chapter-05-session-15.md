## The Court

The dining hall of Castle Ravenloft was full of monsters dressed as nobility. The vampire adventurers from the Feast of St. Andral were all present — Beerna the half-orc barbarian, Kenga the dwarven cleric, Lelrin the moon-elf ranger, and Growland the battlemaster — minus Balthazar, whom Patches had killed. Among the rest of the court: Ludmilla, a dark-skinned noblewoman in white and gold; Anastrasya, a vampire in a red silk gown; Volenta, a tiny, milk-white woman in a gold dress behind a platinum skull mask; and Escher, a gaunt fop with golden hair who could not keep his hands off Gertruda — Mary's runaway daughter, barely sixteen. Several humans attended as well: Boris the guard, Lady Wachter, and a man named Ludwig from Krezk.

Strahd told them no business until after dinner. JmJm made the mistake of approaching Ireena with a drawn cutlass — Rahadin telekinetically stopped the draw, and when JmJm persisted in his charm, Strahd lashed out with dark energy that nearly killed the bard. Cyrrus begged mercy. Strahd released JmJm, who was promptly slapped by Cyrrus and told to leave.

Patches used the commotion to slip inside and pulled Boris onto the dance floor, her graceful movements easing the tension. Tark got Ireena away from Strahd for a dance. Outside the hall, Ludmilla followed JmJm and began to feed on him before he snapped out of her charm and pushed her away. Strahd, apprised of this, apologised for his household's behaviour. Ludmilla returned to the dinner, pouting.

## Bargains and Revelations

The group worked the room. Kenga, the vampire dwarven cleric, sat with Tark and Gundren and quietly begged them to kill him — to free him from Strahd's enslavement. The group learned that every vampire in attendance was a thrall, bound against their will. The adventuring company was not evil — merely enslaved.

Gundren, examining the massive obsidian-headed axe belonging to the giant barbarian vampire Peytr, was surprised to find it light as his own weapon. Peytr called it to his hand with a smirk and told Gundren he hoped to taste his blood. Gundren summoned Gwen, who bumped Rahadin aside on her way past the head of the table. Strahd remarked that the clockwork lion was superior to their own Piddlewick II — a technological curiosity he could not control.

Fëanon received word from Mordenkainen: Rahadin had taken Strahd to the Amber Temple while the count was still human, and the next two pages of the journal were missing. Mordenkainen warned them to keep sunlight at the ready. Fëanon asked Strahd how many times he had found Ireena reborn. Three times — once already old and dying, once murdered by villagers before he could reach her. Fëanon noted she should have appeared more often.

Lelrin, the moon-elf vampire ranger, leaned close to Patches and asked whether she was a Moon Elf pretending to be Drow, or a Drow pretending to be a Moon Elf. Patches answered cryptically and mentioned the Moonwood. Lelrin's eyes went wide. She began signing in Drow hand-sign and pressed a locket into Patches' hand — asking her to return it to her people. Patches agreed.

## Blood in the Water

Cyrrus publicly accused Lady Wachter of trying to kill Ireena. Strahd heard both sides and, as lord of the land, sided with his vassal in a case of word against word. As Lady Wachter left, Patches asked her quietly how her husband was doing. The woman froze, stared daggers at the Drow, and departed.

When business finally came, Strahd laid out his offer: the artifact shard in Buumi's shield, in exchange for freedom. He and Rahadin needed it to break free of Barovia and would bring the group with them when they left. The group whispered among themselves. An army of vampires suddenly appearing in the mortal world seemed profoundly unhealthy. Gundren blurted out that Rahadin was a dragon in disguise. Patches asked the chamberlain pointed questions about the other Dusk Elves. Neither Rahadin nor Strahd reacted.

Tark held up Ysera's golden scale to see if it provoked a response from Rahadin. Nothing. Volenta, however, decided Tark was more interesting than her current companion, shoved Ludwig from his chair, and tried her vampiric charm on the halfling. He shrugged it off.

Then something pricked every member of the group simultaneously — a small pinch, their fingers coming away bloody. Every vampire in the room inhaled. Their eyes went black.

## The Escape

The dining hall doors slammed shut with an ominous boom. Cyrrus screamed at Rahadin to do something. The chamberlain looked around in panic and blasted a ten-foot section of the back wall away, creating an exit. Buumi shoved Ludwig through and took a defensive position. Patches dropped a globe of darkness over Strahd, Peytr, Rahadin, and Anastrasya, then sent Boris running for the exit. Tark snapped a chair leg, dropping Beerna to the floor, and shadowstepped to Ireena — throwing her over his shoulder and leaping off the back wall to clear the room, her upper body smacking the floor as she was roughly twice his size. Gundren and Cyrrus took defensive positions in the corridor.

Strahd's voice called from the darkness: he could only hold the blood-thirst so long and implored them to flee. JmJm screamed as Ludmilla transformed from beauty to fanged horror on top of him and bolted for the exit with Steven on his heels.

The passwall expired and the group found themselves in a dark, dusty corridor — a spiral staircase behind them leading up and down, a large dark room ahead. Ludwig called out that he saw something in the darkness. A ballista bolt speared him off his feet. A monstrous undead frost giant was loading another shot. Tark rushed to the dying man, pulled the bolt free, and saw the damage — there was no saving him. Fëanon ran for the stairwell and stepped on a trap, pin-cushioned by crossbow bolts. Buumi healed him. Gundren and Cyrrus collapsed the ceiling to block the giant's line of fire.

## The Catacombs

The group fled downward. JmJm reached the bottom first, drew his cutlass with a flourish, and proclaimed *"Come and get me, monsters!"* A massive footfall answered. A living marble golem — an Adonis in stone — rounded the corner. JmJm squeaked, turned invisible, and ran.

Tark shadowstepped to the golem with a rope to trip it. The golem tore the rope apart and clubbed him. Patches webbed behind it and drove her blade into its back. Gundren opened fire. Fëanon and Cyrrus laid down a magical barrage. Ireena and Boris watched from the doorway as the seasoned adventurers dismantled the golem in short order — Gwen leaping off a wall to knock it down, Patches dodging a backhand, the final volley reducing it to broken marble and strange black sludge.

Beyond the wreckage, the corridor opened into the lightless depths of Castle Ravenloft's lower levels — dark, dank, covered in mould and cobwebs, with only a few flickering torches to mark the way. JmJm reported skeletons in ancient rotten cots ahead. The group looked at one another, breathing hard, bleeding, and trapped in the bowels of Strahd's castle. Above them, a court of starving vampires. Below, whatever horrors the catacombs held.

They pressed on.
