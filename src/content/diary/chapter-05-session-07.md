## Inside the Manor

The group sat in the Burgomaster's den, studying the obvious madman across from them. Cyrrus chose tact — he leaned in and placated Vargas, agreeing with everything despite the visible discomfort of Tark and Buumi. He went further, offering the group's services to appraise the town's magical and monetary assets. Taken aback, Vargas excused himself to consult his wife.

The moment he left, the group scattered. Patches slipped from the shadows, handed off the scrolls and books she had stolen to Fëanon, and headed to the Bluewater Inn to secure rooms. Buumi stayed in the den to receive the Burgomaster's return. The rest explored the house through a combination of magic and stealth.

Tark went through the kitchens. Cyrrus, now disguised as Izek, headed to the second floor, noting the many landscape paintings lining the hallway. A maid spotted him and asked if he had misplaced his key in a drunken stupor again. Playing along, he let her unlock Izek's door and shuffle off.

Inside were hundreds of dolls. Every one of them looked like Ireena.

Cyrrus searched the room but found nothing else of interest — just empty wine bottles. Moving on, he checked Victor's room and found only a book on basic wizardry. The next door was locked, but peering through the keyhole he saw a man chained inside a closet, horribly beaten and tortured.

## The Shoemaker and the Mage

Cyrrus reached out telepathically to Fëanon. Within minutes, he, Tark, and Fëanon converged on the closet and broke the prisoner free — a local shoemaker who had spoken out against the Burgomaster. They contacted Buumi, who extracted himself from conversation with Vargas and positioned himself below a second-storey window. The group lowered the shoemaker on a rope, lost their grip halfway, and dropped him squarely onto the paladin in a clatter of armour and limbs.

As Buumi hauled the man toward the Bluewater Inn, Fëanon spotted Izek — the real Izek — follow him inside with two guards. Then footsteps behind them. The group turned to find the Burgomaster at the top of the stairs with two guards, flintlocks drawn and aimed. Vargas had been informed of their interference with the prisoners, and with the shoemaker now freed, he was convinced they were agents of Strahd — but Cyrrus was still wearing Izek's face. He pulled Vargas aside and convinced him this was all part of a grander plan. Skeptical but persuaded, Vargas departed but left two guards and ordered "Izek" to take the group to the attic, where his son Victor — a mage — could assist.

The group put the guards to sleep the moment the Burgomaster was out of earshot. In a side room they found a heavily enchanted vanity mirror capable of summoning a spectral killer, though it might kill the summoner in the process. It went into the bag of holding.

## Victor's End

The attic was cluttered with antiques and dust, a clear path leading to a wooden door carved with a skull and the words "ALL IS NOT WELL!" Tark's enchanted eyepatch revealed a glyph ward on the threshold. Fëanon and Cyrrus knocked and announced themselves as powerful spellcasters come to speak with the fledgling mage of Vallaki.

Victor was arrogant at first, then excited when he realised someone might actually help him with his spells. He disabled the wards and opened the door — screaming at "Izek" to leave before eagerly inviting Fëanon and Tark inside. The room contained several dead animated cats, three disturbing dolls dressed as students that Victor claimed were for "leadership practice," and an unfinished teleportation circle with a bloodstain at its centre.

Both Fëanon and Cyrrus noticed the spellbook clutched in Victor's hands was far too advanced for the young man to have written himself. They stole it and replaced it with an illusion at the first opportunity. Through conversation, they found Victor to be as unhinged as his father — and learned he had murdered two family servants, using them as test subjects for the circle, where they had been torn apart.

Seeing no further use for a dangerous murderer and wanting his spellbook, Cyrrus charmed Victor and had him step into the circle for a "lesson." Fëanon empowered it. The circle activated and tore Victor apart.

Tark, who had been playing with the undead cats, turned at the sound and stared in horror. He could not comprehend the magic, but he could feel that something terrible had just happened — that this young man, murderer though he was, had been murdered in turn. Exasperated and shaken, clutching a purring undead cat under one arm, he turned to leave.

## The Bluewater Inn

The group rushed to the inn, expecting trouble from Izek. They found the common room in disarray — scattered tables and chairs, two unconscious guards, and Izek out cold on the floor. Buumi sat calmly at the bar while the proprietor, Urwen Martikov, tended his minor wounds.

Cyrrus walked in disguised as the Burgomaster and berated the unconscious Izek, declaring that in his drunkenness the enforcer had picked a fight and should have his demonic arm cut off. Buumi and Tark played along with objections while Urwen looked on aghast. Tark picked up Izek's limp body and hurled it through the nearest window into the alley. Cyrrus dropped the disguise, walked outside, re-entered as himself, and sat down as if nothing had happened.

Urwen brought free food and ale and introduced himself properly. He asked who the group sided with and what they intended to do in Vallaki. The group was noncommittal, but Urwen offered a deal: if they would investigate why shipments from his father's winery — the Wizard of the Wines — had stopped arriving, he would consider them allies and assist however he could. The group studied him closely. He was not entirely human, that much was clear, but they could not determine what he was.

Before they could rest, another patron entered. A tall, stately middle-aged woman approached their table and introduced herself as Lady Wachter. She congratulated them for antagonising the Burgomaster and offered her friendship, pressing them to topple Vargas and install her family in his place. She claimed no enmity with Strahd. The group refused the alliance but told her they did intend to remove Vargas — the succession was for the people of Vallaki to decide. Lady Wachter rose, thanked them coolly, and assured them the town would choose her regardless.

As the tavern settled, the group noticed a figure on the guest balcony above — a half-elf in a fine suit, grey-haired, with an exquisite wide-brimmed hat and a cane of ebony and mother-of-pearl. He regarded them with open curiosity, then made for the stairs.
