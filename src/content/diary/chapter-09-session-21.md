The great column of demonic ooze gazes at Patches.

Juiblex speaks, its voice thrumming in the Drow’s mind, only her separation in the Ethereal plane protecting her mind.

The Demon Lord asks who she is and why she bypassed Hisesophax (Who Patches determines was the Balor Demon she ran past).

Patches decides to go big, and calls out with confidence, raising her celestial weapon Eclipse before her.

She proclaims that The Celestial Army that slew Demogorgon is now here for him, unless he makes himself useful to the greater cause against Lolth or Atropos.

The great ooze lord is taken aback by the proclamation and then surges forward, moving to surround and engulf the Ethereal Patches.


Meanwhile, the battle of Blingdesntone rages around The Dome.

In the northern tunnels, Take and Snorbul surround and gang up on the remaining Barlgura, but the tough Demon proves to be hard to kill.

Until Thorna rushes past, smashing the demon with both her hammers and in a flash of sparks and spray of frost the demon falls dead and Thorna hurls an icy spear at the two nearby Oozes.

Stunned by the furious assault, it takes Snorbul a moment to collect himself before roaring in glee and rushing onto the nearby oozes.

The firing line down to the south appears to be destroying anything that shows its face and Gundren grins.

Feanon calls out though that the Oozes are pulling back and sure enough, the massive number of Black Puddings, Grey Oozes and Gelatinous Cubes all begin to head to the north east, leaving the Demons behind to fight.

From within The Dome, the group and Gnomes all begin to hear the start of gutteral abyssal chanting and the Demons begin to summon more of their own kind.

Suddenly, as one of the Barlgura’s by the southern line is thrown aside and slain, it splatters across a Wall of Force.

Cirrus calls it out and they then notice a small, ooze covered Gnome has walked from The Dome and is spellcasting in their direction.

The group looks north and sees the Deep Gnome army surging from the main entrypoint and hitting the retreating Oozes and steadfast Demons, Elementals leading the way.

As the Gnomes come into view though, two Red oozes come out of The Dome, flanking the strange little Gnome wizard and each releases a blast of arcane energy; a Fireball and a Lightning Bolt.

Both blast into the Gnomes, the Elementals taking the brunt of it, but many Gnomes calling out in pain.

Diggermattock counterspells another blast and repositions his troops just as Gundren finishes repositioning via an Elemental Earthglide.

Circumventing the Wall of Force, the Gunslinger begins to blast away at the Ooze covered Deep Gnome.

Cirrus and Feanon both resposition, Earthgliding past the Wall of Force just as the Druids seal their flank from attacking Barlguras with a Passwall enchantment.

Feanon and Cirrus open up on the little Oozing Deep Gnome wizard.

The thing tries to disintegrate the Warlock, but as the green light flashes from his hands toward Cirrus, Feanon Counterspells and breaks the attack.

The oozing gnome is slain shortly after as a shell from Gundren hits it square in the head…


Tark, Snorbul and Thorna all rush down from the north, spotting the fleeing mass of oozes and demons about to be caught between themselves and the attacking Gnomes.

Tark summons a wall of fire to seal off the Oozes escape to the north just as Trisks warriors set up on the other side to kill any survivors.

Pressed from behind, the Oozes are then forced into the Wall of Fire and burned, any survivors then being hacked apart by Trisk.

Thorna calls a Lightning cloud above her in the caverns and flashing lightning begins to strike down at the Demons defending The Dome.

Hearing the sounds of summoning from within the main chamber of The Dome, Thorns calls on the power of Winter and summons a sleet storm within, pummeling the area with heavy ice.

It has the desired effect and several of the summoning voices are disrupted.

The three adventurers join the fray of battle in full.


Patches is surrounded by the Demon Lord, but completely safe in the Ethereal plane, the creature is just trying to intimidate her.

Not having any of it, Patches reminds it that she slew Demogorgon and he’s next.

Juiblex chuckles, saying his minions will test this “Army”, but that it is interested in a deal.

Patches asks what kind of a deal and the monster responds that its nemesis, Zuggtomy lairs nearby.

It wants the groups help in slaying her, and banishing her properly.

Patches inquires further than Juiblex tells Patches that the Queen of Fungi is seeking to infect and spread her spores throughout the Underdark somehow.  He seeks to assault her with his army of oozes and demons and wishes the group to help.

Patches thanks the creature for its time, and then flees, rushing back up the natural tunnel to return to the rest of the group as quickly as possible.


Patches rushes up the tunnel, returning to the Prime Material plane as she nears the opening to The Dome.

She goes through her pack, grabbing gemstones, bombs and anything else she thinks she will need and then sneaks the rest of the way to the battleground.

Entering The Dome interior, Patches takes note of the enemies.

She sees the Chasme Demons on the ceiling, undulating weirdly and regurgitating bubbling ooze over the eggs clumped to the ceiling.

She watches as one of those eggs hatches, like runny yolk being poured from an egg, it splashes down to the ground, and then rises into a vaguely humanoid looking ooze creature.

She watches as three more of the things drip and drop to the ground, then rush out to join the battle.

Additionally, the Rogue spots three ooze-covered Glabrezu demons, these with crablike carapace and proportions, each is flying nearby an exit to The Dome.

Through the north rushes Snorbul, Thorns and Tark close behind as the Deep Gnomes rush the Southwest Entrance.

The Balor rushes forward to meet them and their Elemental allies.

Seeing the crux of the battle finally reveal itself, Patches, Snorbul and the Deep Gnomes rush in with Feanon, Gundren and Diggermattock’s men pushing up the stairs into the building.

The flying Glabrezu let loose a volley of Power Word Stuns, hitting Gundren, the Wererats and Cirrus just as their respective lines clash.

Cirrus staggers, though is surrounded by allied Elementals and backed up by the healing Druids and Priests of the Gnomes.

Good thing too, as the Barlgura Demon he now faces is backed up by the two Arcane wielding oozes.

Indeed, the red creatures summoned Sulfurous impersonations that attacked both Feanon and Cirrus, draining their memories.

The battle rages across the cavern, the Balor of Juiblex showering the area with burning acid and lashing out with corrosive appendages.

It smashes apart an Earth Elemental and burns at the Deep Gnomes, the fury of the Greater Demon a terror to behold.
