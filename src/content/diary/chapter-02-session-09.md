The group forms up, casting numerous spells to prepare for the onslaught of the spider horde.  Buumi and Tark both meet the spiders on the ledge as they crest, but two phase spiders warp past the perimeter guard, attacking Budder, killing and devouring him.  The second phase spider heads for Kangaxx, but using her web gauntlet, Patches drops from the ceiling, assassinating the beast with ease.  Myria and Lester hold the back tunnel against giant spiders and Lothli cuts down many spiders with her hail of arrows.  Fey'Anon supports the group with haste and enchantment spells and Kangaxx shoots out a number of magic missiles and even charms one of the spiders.  The massive spider crests the ledge, only to catch two fireballs in the face, one from the Ruby earring from Patches, and one from Fey'Anon.  The earring ruby, when thrown, hatches into a ruby firefly obeying the mental commands of Patches (lasts 24 hours before reverting to a Ruby).  The massive spider lets out a shriek, calling more of it's underlings to it as Buumi strikes a powerful blow, enchanted with the power of Helm.  As the spider re-enforcements swarm, Lester is brought down in a press of legs and fangs, Myria too taking many wicked bites but surviving…barely.  The large beast is downed in a flurry of blows from Tark and a sizzling lightning bolt from Fey (clipping Buumi in the process).  The remaining spiders are easily mopped up.  Buumi quickly rushes to Myria's aid, healing her wounds and poison, but she's still in a rough state.  The group searches the area, gathering a large amount of spider venom - with Patches tearing off one of the large fangs of the gargantuan spider, now wielding it as a dagger (1d4 +4 Poison dmg).

   The group heads deeper into the crevasse, eventually getting to the bottom but are met by a wall of fog and mist, Myria breaks out the torches and the group steps into the mist and are immediately assaulted by waves of insanity.  Fey'Anon is rendered mute and Patches, in a rage, lashes out for Tark only to be restrained by Buumi and his enhanced strength.  As Fey and Patches recover, the rest of the group is having a hard time staying lucid.  As they head into a labyrinth of tunnels, the clinking of bones and ancient armor echoes through the too-still air of the tunnels and the group is met by animated skeletons, coming at them from every tunnel.
