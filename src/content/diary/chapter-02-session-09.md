The group formed up along the ledge, casting every protective spell they had as the spider horde surged upward through the webbing. Buumi and Tark met the first wave as they crested the edge, cutting down giant spiders in quick succession. Two phase spiders warped past the perimeter guard — one materialized on top of Budder Glint and killed the gnome mage before anyone could react, devouring him where he fell. The second phase spider lunged for Kangaxx, but Patches dropped from the ceiling on her web gauntlet, assassinating the creature mid-pounce.

Myria and Lester held the rear tunnel against a stream of giant spiders while Lothli cut down wave after wave with her arrows. Fëanon bolstered the group with haste and enchantment spells, and Kangaxx contributed volleys of magic missiles — even managing to charm one of the spiders into turning on its kin.

## The Matriarch

The gargantuan spider crested the ledge, legs spanning wider than a wagon. It caught two fireballs in the face — one from Patches' ruby earring, and one from Fëanon. The earring's ruby, when thrown, hatched into a ruby firefly that obeyed Patches' mental commands for twenty-four hours before reverting to a gem. The matriarch let out a piercing shriek, summoning reinforcements from the webs below. Buumi struck a powerful blow enchanted with the power of Helm, but the spider reinforcements swarmed the rear line — Lester was dragged down in a press of legs and fangs, and Myria took many wicked bites before barely surviving.

Tark hammered the great beast with a flurry of blows while Fëanon loosed a sizzling lightning bolt — clipping Buumi in the process — that finished the matriarch. The remaining spiders were easily mopped up. Buumi rushed to Myria's side, healing her wounds and neutralizing the venom, though she remained badly shaken. The group harvested a large amount of spider venom from the corpses, and Patches tore off one of the matriarch's massive fangs to wield as a dagger.

## Into the Mist

The group pressed deeper into the crevasse, eventually reaching the bottom — only to find their path blocked by a wall of roiling fog. Myria broke out torches, and the group stepped into the mist. The effect was immediate. Waves of insanity crashed over them — Fëanon was struck mute, unable to form words, while Patches flew into a blind rage and lunged for Tark. Buumi restrained her with his enhanced strength until the madness passed.

As Fëanon and Patches recovered, the rest of the group struggled to stay lucid. They pushed forward into a labyrinth of tunnels, the air unnaturally still and heavy. Then, from deep within the passages, came the clinking of bones and ancient armor — growing louder from every direction. Animated skeletons emerged from the tunnels, converging on the group from all sides.
