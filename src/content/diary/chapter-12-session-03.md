Tark rushes down the small canyon to the ambush location, noting the position of the boulder.

He stays just far enough to be out of charging range of the creatures, but not so far that they give up the chase.

He rushes into position and the group springs the trap.

The boulder tumbles down the cliffside, smashing into the beasts and laying two out flat as the rock comes to a halt.

Gundren and Feanon begin blasting with the firelances and Tark leaps into combat.

Cirrus rushes down the hill with a tired yell, but trips and tumbles the last ten feet.

Snorbul rushes over to pick him up before charging on into combat.

Buumi tries to follow, but stumbles as well, falling and clattering down the cliffside with his armor before getting to his feet and rushing to the fight.

As one of the creatures is killed, Liara raises the corpse of one to fight for the group, startling Buumi and Tark.

They make short work of the strange beasts, slaughtering them.

The group is more or less unharmed, having resisted the psychic attacks of the beasts.

They look to Liara, who releases her spell and the corpse falls inanimate once more.

Tark freaks out, about the use of necromancy and Buumi even is concerned.

They demand to know which god Liara serves; Zalaam, god of death.

The group is startled and come on guard, afterall, the cult that led them to this world was doing horrific things in the name of Zalaam.

Liara calls them heretics and says that their way is a false way and they must be destroyed.

The group agrees but Tark still doesn't know if he can trust her.

Buumi recounts a cult that sprung up in his own order, in a group of Paladins at Helm’s Hold.

They were led astray by a Devil that had killed the Grandmaster and taken over a few years back.

The cult was rooted out and destroyed.

Liara confirms that the cult they have faced is very similar.

The group lets it go, for now, but Tark endeavors to keep an eye on her and the group agrees.

Liara sanctifies the corpses of the beasts - which were once human.

The group then heads back to where Tark had found the ruined wagon and begin a salvage operation.

As the bodies are once again seen to, they note that many of them are armed and armored.

The group recovers a shipment of alcohol and a wagon that their Khonsfa beetle can pull.  

They load it up, put Cirrus in the back and head the last few miles to the Stone Spire.

As they approach the place, they see numerous caravans parked outside the walls, their crews all gathered around campfires and tents.

The group is stopped by the guards as they approach and are told that if they have no goods to trade, it’s 200 Durhams a person.  If they have goods to trade, it’s free entry.

The group shows the guards the alcohol (who are surprised at an exhausted Cirrus in the back) and usher the group inside, toward the tavern.

Inside the walls, the group avails themselves of the Oasis, refilling their water supplies. 

Shockingly, no one goes for a swim, likely due to the number of distractions, which includes concern for the exhausted Cirrus.

The group meets with the leader of the Oasis by the Tavern - turns out a number of her guards stole this shipment of alcohol meant for the Oasis.

She thanks the group for returning it and offers 2,000 Durhams up front, or 1,800 and a followup job.

The group elects to take the lump sum, keep on reaching Ras Alkan and not wanting to deal with hunting down monsters in the nearby hills.

The leader, Chrysalis, says she always has work and the group heads outside the wall to make camp.

They settle down for the night and the group springs their plan to get Cirrus to sleep.

Feanon casts his deep slumber on his friend, intent on shielding his mind from nightmares and allowing him to get some rest.

He resists.

Cirrus spins, sees Liara nearby (waiting in case she was needed with her lullaby) and he lunges at her with a knife.

Snorbul and Buumi who were nearby, both tackle him to the ground and quickly subdue Cirrus, knocking him unconscious as Cirrus pleads.

They make the warlock as comfortable as possible and settle in for an uneventful night.

Cirrus meanwhile, dreams of a floating in a vast body of water, a starry nebula filled sky above him and the moon of Al’Askar visible.

He is terrified and begins to distress but a great voice tells him not to worry, that he is safe here and can rest and that he pushes himself too much.

The entity says that he has great power within, if he would only accept it.

Cirrus rejects the entity, worried that this is a dark nightmare trying to lure him from Selune and into another dark pact like he was in before.

The entity leaves, stating that it wishes no harm on him and Cirrus rests for the remainder of the night in dreamlessness.

That night, Liara goes into some of her backstory, mentioning she is part of a larger group called the “Usurpers of Rudjek”.

Buumi points out that their group name is the Faerun Defense force, but some call them the Heralds of Woe.

Liara mentions that they overthrow the ruler of the Iyum named Rudjek. She calls him a Shaa’barid - The Cold One. and says that she followed his Vizier (a member of the cult of the Black Skull) out to where she met up with this group.

As she says what it took to kill Rudjek (being stabbed in the heart by a magic weapon while in Sunlight) and her other descriptions lead the group to think he muast have been some kind of Vampire.

He awakes and finds himself surrounded by a concerned group.

Furious at his treatment, he storms away, Buumi in close pursuit apologizing profusely.

Cirrus blames Buumi for what amounts to assault and Buumi accepts that, saying he didn't know what else to do to save his life.

As Buumi and Cirrus return to the group, a rough looking vagrant asks to tell their fortune, but they refuse him.

The group packs up and continue north, toward the city of Ras Alkan.

The group makes good time, putting many miles between themselves and the Oasis.

The Scrublands and sage-desert is much easier to travel over than the Red Hills and the mountain.

Near the end of the first day though trouble finds the group.

The group stumbles across two creatures attempting an ambush.

Massive turtle-like creatures appear on the trail and attack, teleporting around the battlefield and unleashing psychic attacks.

As the group rallies to counterattack, they realize that the creatures are extremely tough and little damage is getting through their thick shells…
