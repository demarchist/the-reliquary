The day prior:  Cirrus addresses the adoring masses, healing the sick and making his presence known before heading to his Fane (kissing babies and whatnot)

He meets up with his top acolytes - Temura, Topsy and Turvey

Cirrus takes them to his inner sanctum and then has Magistrate Li summoned to him

It takes her some time due to her briefing the others at The Establishment, but she arrives and gives Cirrus the same report

Cirrus is delighted at how well things have been going and proclaims that he has brough Selune to a new world. 

The festivities of High Sun will be immediately followed by a week-long festival of the Moon - paid for by Cirrus out of pocket

Li is happy to oblige and leaves to begin preparations

Cirrus and Temura talk a little theology and Temura mentions that with the advent of Selune on this far world, Shar has also gained a foothold.

Cirrus denies this and dismisses Temura, who bows without question and leaves

Topsy leaves to assist Li and Turvey remains

For her devotion, Cirrus True Polymorphs her into a being of pure silver and chrome, radiating a soft light

The Svirfneblin - no longer - is delighted and leaves to praise Selune in the Fane proper where all can see and hear her

Cirrus, exhausted by exulting in his goddess, goes to the highest point of the Fane and begins his evening prayers (yodles)

He awakens the next morning and reaches for a glass of pure water

Unfeeling fingertips bump the glass and almost knock it over

Cirrus looks at his hands in confusion and see the skin, ashen and flakey

He communes with Selune for answers and finds out that the ritual they used to flee Alaskar and bring Selune to that world has wounded him.

She did all she could to shield him, but it has taken a heavy toll

He asks how he can be healed and he is told to come to Selune via “The Towers of Twilight”

He hides his affliction with his illusions and goes to visit Doc B

Doc happily casts a Heal over the Warlock without question and Cirrus thanks the Druid with no explanation

He then heads toward The Establishment to tell his friends of the wonderful celebrations planned


That morning, the rest of the group are refreshed and glad to be home.

The familiar noises and smells of Faerun in Summer provides a pervading calm that was lacking in Alaskar

The biggest difference? Birdsong and the smell of plants

Everyone begins to converge on The Establishment


Patches awakes and heads through the tunnels of *Over the Moon*, checking out the gambling Den for Lo Dan

The drow there say he’s gone, but just as she turns away, she recognizes the speaker and pulls back the hood revealing a smirking Lo Dan

She needs information on the current power plays within house Faen Tlabbar

Lo Dan nods in understanding and Patches heads upstairs to the main floor for breakfast

She finds Gundren, Buumi, Tark and two unknown people sitting at a table, talking

Tark introduces the two monks, forgetting both their names and needing to be corrected; Minnow the Blue Dragonborn and Goro, the small asian human lady with blonde hair


Buumi takes Patches aside and tells her that he needs to know two things before he can marry Patches.

Does she want kids? Because Buumi does

And he needs to know if his feelings for her are genuine or simply because of proximity

For propriety's sake, he must at least date Lady Aldencroft a little

Patches understands and begins to plot to have Lady Aldencroft…removed, she sends Mr Pickles to spy on both her and Lodan


Feanon and JmJm arrive together, Feanon looking rather exhausted and disheveled

Cirrus arrives a few minutes later and joins the table, already laden with food and drink

When questioned, the Monks relay that they are in the west to seek Tark and ensure he did not fall to darkness and now that has been cleared up, they seek allies to take east to help them battle Zhengyi

Tark tells the group in no uncertain terms that he intends to leave in 7 days for the Bloodstone Lands.

He MUST deal with his family’s killer.  Buumi swears that he will assist his friend in seeking retribution against the Lich.

Patches then agrees to help Tark if he will in turn help her with her Mother.

Tark agrees

Cirrus then informs the group that they can't leave before the Moon Celebration ends!

Tark, exasperated, reiterates his intention to leave *as soon as reasonably possible*

Gundren then points out that all the rare materials he needs to forge Patches Crossbow have arrived - all save the Bloodrinker Wyvern Bone, which he now has a solid lead on.

A 2 day journey tops and he can craft a masterpiece

Gundren takes out his map and points to the High Plateau of the northern Anauroch Desert

Cirrus is a bit reluctant, but his Moon celebration cannot begin until High Sun is over, which it will be in two days, so he decided to go along with it

JmJm perks up at the prospect of a journey to the country of the old Netherese Empire, as does Feanon

Journeying into the Anauroch is often a profitable, though potentially deadly excursion


The conversation then turns to why Feanon looks so bad

The situation with the book is explained and Tark is aghast when JmJm mentions that this was once the MO of Zhengyi from centuries ago

The two Vaasan monks confirm the stories; tales they have heard of the Lich Zhengyi “The Witch King of Damara”, trapping and consuming spellcasters with cursed tomes.

The learned and wise among the group then begin to discuss how they may remove or sever the curse consuming Feanon.

The speed of the curse seems to indicate they have several days to find a solution, but Feanon does not want his strength sapped daily

They need another target to shunt the connection to

The more moral members of the group indicate that no one in the Barony is a suitable candidate and protest the whole idea really

Feanon laments that the prison only has a single thief and he is unwilling to subjugate the person to this curse for such a trivial crime.

Gundren suggests *finding *a target and Cirrus suggests *making *one…

Gundren leaves the Establishment and spots a nearby group of guards talking with a rather distraught looking human farmer

He heads over and discovers that this farmer was raided last night by Goblins

The Guard were about to send out a Patrol but Gundren stops them - he will handle this personally


Gundren finds the farm easily and begins tracking the Goblin raid out to the foothills

Some 15 miles from town, Gundren finds the raiders camping in a dale and resting

Among them is an imposing looking Hobgoblin, covered in intricate black plate and with a crimson cape

The goblin guards spot the Owlbear and its rider and the camp begins to come alive

Gundren opens fire on the clear leader

The Hobgoblin throws out a hand and two shots explode on the Shield spell

The third clips the target

The Hobgoblin summons a Dimension door, steps through and vanishes

Gundren then proceeds to annihilate all the Goblins, scattering survivors into the hills

He flies down and manages to tourniquet off the legs of one Goblin thats barely alive

Gundren throws the prisoner onto Arkto and heads back to the Barony


Tark is shaken by the realization that Zhengyi is projecting power far across the world and excuses himself from the Establishment, needing a walk to think

Cirrus and Feanon retire to a private room, not wanting to alarm the common folk

There, they true polymorph a chair, into an old man - an approximation of what Feanon *thinks *Zhengyi looks like

The elderly asian man with wispy white hair is then smacked in the face by Feanon (who hurts his hand doing so)

The newly created person looks around, dazed and confused - a completely blank slate

The wizard then pulls on the threads of magic surrounding himself and Wishes for the Curse to be shunted to this man.  With the most powerful Dispel magic the Wizard has ever unleashed, the Curse is pushed to the nearest unprotected soul - the chair that has become a man

Cirrus then opens a Demiplane and they unceremoniously shove the now exhausted, confused newborn through the portal and close it, trapping him inside. Alone.

Feanon feels his exhaustion immediately lessen and he sighs in relief

Cirrus and Feanon then return to their table in the bar below, though Feanon feels a twinge of….shame?


Tark walks along the forest paths of the Barony, heading up to the top of the nearby Red Hill

He needs answers

He finds a secluded spot to meditate and focuses on his Staff and his missing hand.

The connection to Bahamut is strong here back in Faerun and Tark finds himself in communion with the Platinum Dragon, or one of his agents

Tark asks of Zhengyi

He finds that the Lich’s power is stretching out and harming people even here

Tark suspects something dark is growing and has a bad feeling about the near future

He then focuses on his arm and feels an unexpected connection

The Alaskarian god of Power - Vaketh, is with him

As per their agreement, Vaketh has left Alaskar

He hitched a ride on Tark and now offers the Monk power

Tark asks the price and is told that the god merely wishes to come along for the ride after an eternity of imprisonment by Vecna

With the nascent god of Power and the focus of Bahamut, Tark begins to change his staff

The white wood molds and contorts and threads of reddish metal thread the masterwork wooden prosthesis that forms to heal the wounded Monk

As he meditates, Tark watches two youths run a footrace up the hill and then leap from the hundred foot cliffs into the summer water below, youthful laughter then echoing up the cliffsides


When Gundren arrives back at the Barony, he gives the wounded Goblin over to Feanon who takes him to be healed at The Fane. 

He will be questioned later.


It's time to head to the Anauroch

The group convenes at the Druid Grove and Doc performs his Windwalking ritual, speeding the Team across the landscape many thousands of miles, past dunes and ruined castle Ravenloft, to the high plateau of the Anauroch desert.

They set up camp - Gundren throwing out his renovated Instant Fortress and setting up inside

Feanon and JmJm go for a walk, hoping to get a good lay of the land, they find the place to be desolate and devoid of interest

JmJm bends and picks up a beautifully ornate ring worth many thousands of gold that he *wishes *into existence.

They return to the tower and the group rests for the night

They are awoken in the darkest hours of the morning by the howls of Winter Wolves, but the great beasts do not go near the great Adamantine Tower

The next morning, they have a hearty breakfast and then begin the trek across the desolate landscape, heading north toward the glaciers.

The sun blazes and dust swirls - not unlike their recent time in Alaskar, but somehow not quite so awful

They are hoping to spot sign of their quarry and begin to scan the skies

On the northern horizon, Gundren spots another step up in the plateau and points it out

With Gundren’s guidance, Patches then notes a draconic form of a creature flying in that direction

It has the telltale lack of forearms that mark is as a Wyvern

The group gives chase toward the great Plateau
