Following the Balgura demon deeper into the forest, Patches arrived at the demon stronghold. There she negotiated — in full Drow priestess regalia — with a Glabrezu and a Chasme demon. Gaining their trust through sheer audacity, she convinced them to hand over their key. In return she would signal them to attack the devils. She left the stronghold breathing considerably easier and rendezvoused with Lothli and a strange elf and dwarf the ranger had encountered in the woods.

Across the forest, Fëanon was escorted to meet a Malbranche devil. Acting as though he were a servant of Asmodeus, he delivered a performance convincing enough to get one of the bearded devils executed on the spot. He struck the same deal as Patches — the devils' key in exchange for a signal to attack their enemies.

The two groups met back at the inactive archway portal, leaving demons and devils waiting for signals that would never come.

## The Tomb

Stepping through the portal, the group found themselves in an ornate marble tomb. Four sarcophagi of exquisite craftsmanship stood in the center of the chamber. At the far end sat the next archway, flanked by two ancient thrones in which rested armored skeletons. An altar lay before them, four metal keys resting upon it.

As the group approached, a ghostly glow suffused the skeletons. The ancient bones took on the spectral forms of what they had once been — vibrant and glorious paladin kings. Nebuchadnezzar and Azrael told the group that one key opened the portal; all the rest were trapped.

The group attempted to discern the correct key. Fëanon chose incorrectly and was blasted with a jolt of electricity. Patches, characteristically, simply grabbed the next one — and it was the right choice. The portal blazed to life.

## The Paladin Kings

The moment the correct key was chosen, the group was teleported to the far end of the chamber. The paladin ghosts rose from their thrones, hoisting massive greatswords. The sarcophagus lids crashed to the floor as four ancient mummies began to climb out.

The group attacked immediately. One mummy was set ablaze within its own sarcophagus. Another was pummeled with fists and steel while arrows and spells hammered the paladin kings. But the ghostly champions fought with devastating skill — dealing heavy damage while healing, resurrecting, and buffing their mummified allies. Tark was struck with a curse that prevented all healing, and the accumulated wounds soon dropped him unconscious. Finding a second wind through sheer willpower, he surged back to his feet and smashed into Nebuchadnezzar, bringing the first paladin king down.

Azrael and his remaining mummies pressed the assault, nearly felling several members of the group, but they could not prevail against the combined onslaught and were destroyed. The moment both kings fell, the remaining mummies went inert.

Battered and drained, the group rested in the tomb — healing, mending, and steeling themselves for whatever lay deeper inside the vault.
