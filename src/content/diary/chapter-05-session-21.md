## Baba Lysaga Falls

The group fought for their lives around the animated hut as Tark sailed through the air from the destroyed skull. He caught himself in the branches of a tree and looked back to see Baba Lysaga split into hundreds of oozing, flying insects. Patches spotted the blur of the Genoskwa circling them and cast faerie fire — the magic flickered out, and a low guttural chuckle answered from no direction. She hurled throwing knives into the mist. Both missed. In her head, the Reaver begged to be wielded. Patches told it to shut up, then drew the spectral blade anyway. To her surprise, Mordenkainen's Mind Blank was shielding her from the worst of the curse.

The Genoskwa called out that the group had failed to kill it the first time, that it had learned their tricks. A boulder sailed in and struck the hut, the impact knocking everyone from their perch. Cyrrus tumbled — Buumi caught the warlock one-handed and set him down. Cyrrus dove under the hut and fired eldritch blasts at Lysaga's insect swarm. The druids, thrown from the shuddering structure, scrambled upright and summoned a bank of fog over the witch as another rushed to heal her with emerald light.

Tark dove from the tree with a yell, Ashbringer in both hands. Lysaga spun and raised a wall of force — the blow showered the area in sparks. Buumi saw the fog cloud and his friend about to be overrun. He began to glow, turned into a golden streak of light, and rushed across the battlefield to Tark's side, an aura of vitality knitting the monk's wounds.

Cyrrus, sheltering under the hut, was nearly crushed by a massive root. He rolled, taking a clipping blow that broke ribs, then snapped his fingers and banished the hut entirely — the thing shrinking away in a swirl of distorted limbs. On the far side, Gwen pounced on the Genoskwa as it flickered into view. The beast threw the mechanical lion aside — and Gundren put a concussive round through its skull. Patches sprinted in, sliding through the mud and planting her blades in a flurry of stabs. Gwen darted back in with teeth and claws. Even as the wounds healed, Patches drove her dagger deep into the creature's neck. The Genoskwa squealed.

Inside the fog, Tark battered Lysaga until he shattered her shield and stabbed deep into her side. The witch scratched him and released a pulse of transformative energy — Tark flopped into the mud as a small swamp eel. He slithered to Buumi and contorted his body into repeating shapes. In a flash of divine insight, Buumi understood and stamped a boot onto the eel, killing it and breaking the enchantment. The restored monk grinned. Buumi smashed the skull of a druid rushing at his back and the fog dissipated.

Cyrrus, scrambling in the mud, sent out a cascade of calming energy that flooded over the nearby enemies. The druids and zombies stopped fighting. He commanded the druids to heal him and Buumi, and turned the zombies against the twig-blights. Across the battlefield, Fëanon went down under a mass of biting insects. Tark screamed and shadowstepped to his friend, diving atop his body and forcing a healing potion down his throat.

Lysaga cackled and hurled a searing blast of flame at Gundren. The fire caught the dwarf full in the face. His skin blistered and his beard caught fire. With a cry of rage over his burned beard, Gundren shot the witch. Buumi bounded over and smashed his hammer into her. Sixty feet away, the rejuvenated Fëanon pointed a finger and a bolt of flame detonated, exploding the witch's body and scattering gore across the swamp. The remaining zombies fell still.

Patches and Gwen had been making short work of the Genoskwa. Gwen hamstrung the beast as a charmed blight leapt onto its back. Patches rushed in, got clipped by a meaty hand, and sank her dagger into its gut twice. The Genoskwa fell to its knees, grabbed her by the neck and shoulders. She cocked an arm and drove her luck blade through its eye. The thing died with a wet squelch. Not content to let it regenerate, Patches reversed her grip and plunged the Reaver into its chest. The body shook and disintegrated to ash. In her mind, the cursed blade let out a contented sigh.

## The Spoils

Tark and Cyrrus finished off the remaining insects and blights. Patches shot one and crossbowed another. Silence fell over the swamp. Cyrrus yelped as he realised the banished hut would reappear — then reasoned that without a controller, it would be docile. The massive thing reformed in a twist of root-limbs and settled.

Tark climbed inside to check for the baby. No baby — just an illusion. But the green glow beneath the floorboards remained. He pried them up and found three fist-sized emeralds, which Fëanon received with a sharp intake of breath. Patches found a trapped chest under the witch's nest. Cyrrus sent one of the charmed druids to help — the man tripped the sleeping dart and crumpled. Patches picked the lock, handed Fëanon an ancient spellbook and scrolls, pocketed two rubies, two hundred platinum pieces, three diamonds, and a handful of potions. She shoved the sleeping druid out the window.

Cyrrus led both charmed druids aside. He thanked them warmly for their friendship, then offered a gift — motioning them to reach into his bag of devouring. Their screams reached the group and Tark woke with a start. Cyrrus walked out from behind a tree. Tark asked where his friends went. Cyrrus said they had left for Castle Ravenloft. Tark believed him.

## The Sanctum

Fëanon was spent — splitting headache when he tried to summon power. The group heard wings and several wereravens resolved from the mist. Urwen, his wife, brothers, and nieces approached in astonishment at the deaths of both Baba Lysaga and the Genoskwa. Mordenkainen had contacted them. Stick arrived through a dimension door, inscribed a teleportation circle, and brought the group back to the warm comfort of Argynvost's sanctum.

The sanctum was crowded. Where treasure had been piled, half a dozen cots held children. The wereravens thanked the group and went to their families. Tark and Cyrrus collapsed into armchairs opposite Ireena and Ezmerelda — Ireena gazing into the fire remembering past lives, Ezmerelda meticulously cleaning her gear. At the oak table, Mordenkainen worked on an elaborate alchemy set while Stick zipped across the room to his hand with a telepathic *"wheeeee!"*

The group had perhaps twelve hours before Castle Ravenloft left Barovia. Tark had no intention of letting Strahd escape his prison — until Mordenkainen explained the plan: adjust the teleportation spell to land the castle in a desert at dawn, destroying the undead army with sunlight. Tark reluctantly agreed.

As the group settled to rest, Fëanon felt the entity trapped in his ring reach out with images of devastation and death — and a promise of survival with its help. Even against his better judgement, the wizard could not ignore it. Meanwhile, Patches slipped into reverie and found herself in a desolate void. The Lenanshidhe smiled at her — crimson hair, cat eyes, delicate fangs. Lea thanked Patches for the Genoskwa's powerful soul and proposed an exchange: information on Rahadin for a future favour. Patches learned that the dragon was not alone — an Atropal entity shielded him from harm. She woke with a start and told Cyrrus, who cocked an eyebrow before returning to his book.

The group took a long rest. The drain of two weeks of constant battle left them still exhausted — until Mordenkainen handed each of them a potion of vitality. They drank and found themselves rejuvenated.

## The Briefing

Gundren poured the silver ewer and summoned a feast on the oak table. Over breakfast, Mordenkainen asked Fëanon to assist with a scrying spell. In the sanctum's fireplace, they saw Castle Ravenloft — every surface crawling with animated dead. Bats and spectres whirled in a vortex above. Atop the main gate, Lady Wachter surveyed the converging horde. Lightning struck in an almost constant curtain as the massive teleportation spell neared completion. Out across the valley, Vistani caravans fled toward the borders amid burning settlements.

The group examined two ways in: the castle sewers emptying at the Tser Pool, or a bat cavern connecting to the catacombs. They chose the cavern. They would fly up, infiltrate, and signal Mordenkainen to teleport in everyone else once they were inside.

They looked upon the castle and the lightning strikes and knew the end of Barovia was at hand.
