The group slays the Alghoul, though with great effort.

The Machina core of the thing detonates on its death, disintegrating what was left of the body.

The group relaxes a little and takes stock of the room.

It appears to be a derelict cafeteria, with splintered tables and chairs seemingly scattered by the Alghoul.

The nearby kitchen in arrayed mid-cook, however everything is decrepit and moldy, the food long spoiled.

A nearby metal door is badly gouged and scratched by the Abomination and the group moved to investigate.

They find the door locked, but easily bypassed.

The door opens, reveling a group of Mezzoloth fiends engaged in a gambling game, with one in the back working on a Titanium Lockbox.

The group instantly incapacitates them with a spell and they then tie them up for interrogation.

Looking back at the kitchen, Feanon determines its setup works as a shrine to these fiends, providing sustenance to them.

They discover that “The Lady in White” controls this facility and that her and her forces pulled out a few days ago.  

These Mezzoloths were the last to pull out, but thought to loot the place instead, running afoul of the Alghoul and were forced to take shelter in this pantry.

The Mezzoloths confirm that this is indeed the Machina factory.

The group then leaves them tied up, take the Titanium Lockbox (which Feanon quickly deciphers) and jam the door so it wont easily open again.

Back in the ruined Cafeteria, the Silver man appears to be suffering from severe chest pain.

They watch in horror as the man falls to his knees, clutching his chest.

Having seen several Machina explode recently, Cirrus contains the man in a globe of Force.

Moments later, the Silver man explodes, filling the chamber with blinding light, but otherwise causing no damage due to the globe of force.

The group looks to Talley, the other survivor of this place, who looks terrified at the prospect of exploding.

The group looks her over, and as far as they can tell, she’s fine.

With nothing more to do, the group presses on.

They check the other door from the Cafeteria, finding a prison.

Inside they find the remains of someone else that had clearly detonated.

Feanon finds a fragment of a Sourcework core embedded in the wall and Patches finds a fragment of Titanium in the ceiling from the same detonation.

Whatever The Lady in White is doing here, it seems to be quite volatile.

Feanon manges to crack the Lockbox the Mezzoloth had and finds a smaller puzzlebox inside as well as a Scroll of Cloning (identified later).

Feanon cracks the smaller Titanium puzzlebox, revealing an immensely powerful magnet - a Lodestone.

Back in the Cafeteria, they give the chamber another thorough look and discover a hidden door.

Behind it is an arcanist’s study and they believe it belongs to The Lady in White.

They investigate the chamber, finding that it connects back to the main chamber and a small set of stairs spirals up to the gun emplacement watching the door.

Gundren heads up there and begins taking detailed schematics of the weapon while the others ransack the study

They find a book of anatomical notes, detailing the Lady’s work in fusing Machina with humanoids, and that she is beginning to do the same with Shadowfell monsters.

Finding nothing else, they push on, returning to the main Foyer.

They take the south door, opening the metal portal and heading down a long stone hallway.

They find a large chamber filled with metal cabinets of varying sizes, all with a grid of crystal buttons on the front.

They determine the crystal to be keypads and work on cracking as many of the locks as they can.

They find numerous potions, ancient firelances and a newly constructed Flesh Golem run off of a Sourcework Core.

They very carefully remove the Core and Feanon stashes it.

Heading further, they find the long hallway continues and they follow it until they enter a large chamber with a metal mesh floor.

As they get near, a number of black tendrils/spike shoot out to attack and the group falls back to the Locker room.

There is one more door to check and they want to investigate it before dealing with whatever made the black tendrils.

They check the last door and find a Chemical storage warehouse filled with Sourcestones and alchemical supplies.

Patches fills all of her bomb supplies and as she does, realizes that there was a great deal more chemicals here until recently. 

The group knows this is a trap and the missing chemicals makes them think “bomb”

They return to the chamber with the black tendrils, which once again shoot out of the floor to attack.

They realize the metal floor is an illusion and instead is simply covered in some kind of black Ferrofluid.

Feanon realizes what he’s dealing with and takes out the Lodestone which repulses the black liquid.

He marches across the chamber to the hexagonal inset on the far wall and inserts the Lodestone.

A solid metal floor slides out from the walls, covering the Ferrofluid and opening a door to a set of stairs that lead deeper into the factory…


Before they head deeper, they realize they have left Gundren back at the weapon emplacement and return to get him.

Back in the Lady’s Study, they find Gundren fascinated by the back wall of the place

He pushes on a brick and the secret room, within the secret room, unlocks.

Inside, he finds two exquisitely made cloning vats.

One contains the corpse of a deceased young woman of Alaskarian descent.

The vats are so finely crafted that even Feanon is impressed.

It seems that the Alghoul from the nearby cafeteria may have broken free of one of these vats.  In which case, The Lady is cloning Alghouls…

They figure that the corpse of the young woman may be a clone of The Lady.  They look over the body until they find what they are looking for - a cubic inch of flesh that looks different from the rest under the armpit.

Feanon cuts it out to scry on The Lady later.

Gundren spends the next several hours dismantling and storing the parts of the Cloning vats in exchange for the Sourcework core that Feanon found.

Everyone takes a much needed break while Buumi stands on guard.

Near the end of the rest, he spots an Armored Shadowfell creature push open the front door and wander in.

Gundren, done with the cloning vat, rushes up to the gun and uses it to blow the thing apart (he does so with glee).

With the Front door closed again, the group heads to the stairs down to the lower levels.

Patches descends first, discovering a moldering barracks that smells like the foul Mezzoloths.

The place is deserted of fiends, but a shattered Mezzoloth statue makes her think there may be a Medusa or Gorgon.

A strangely perfect hole can also be seen in the wall, through which mud has slid and piled up.

She informs the group and Tark returns with her to check the place.  The group readies themselves on the stairs in case of an attack.

In the Barracks, Patches spots something in one of the corners of the room just as Tark cautiously moves in to investigate the too-perfect hole.

Patches points out the dark corner, and they *know *something is hiding there.

As they both turn to look into the corner, they turn their backs on the mudslide and the too-perfect hole, and something shifts the mud, leaping from hiding.

Two Alghouls attack, one in ambush.

They are covered in eyes, with extra orbs covering their heads and even tipping the ends of strange tendrils hanging from their heads.

From the eyes comes a destructive array of energy blasts and rays - some disintegrating the stone around them.

Tark is mauled badly and forced to dodge a series of eyeblasts

Patches drops an orb of Darkness on one Alghoul, blinding it and preventing it from shooting its eyebeams.

The res of the group then rushes down the stairs to assist their friends.

Tark is horribly wounded and the Alghoul, smelling blood, howls and presses its attack.

Tark is taken to the ground.

Flanked by powerful Alghoul abominations, things are not looking good until Cirrus banishes one.

Patches sees Tark go down and rushes to assist, veritably gutting the Alghoul, but sprays the area with its acid blood.

Tark screams and thrashes, near death.

Feanon grabs his friend with Telekinesis and gets him out of harm's way just as Cirrus heals the Monk.

The group then rallies, destroying the remaining Alghoul, but taking eye-blast after eyeblast (though Feanon returns the favor with a Disintegration beam).

Gwen is badly damaged in the battle

The group prepares for the other Alghoul to return from its banishment and as it reappears, they unleash their fury on the creature, tearing it apart and blasting the remains.

Those abominations were absolutely deadly and the group barricades themselves in the barracks for a rest, re-activating the trap the level above for some security.

During this short rest, Feanon scries on the owner of the cube of flesh.

He spots a thin, tall woman, covered in white robes with a white veil covering her head and a wreath of white roses. She floats amongst the clouds, high above the Machina factor, hand raised mid finger-snap.  Though she does not move, nor snap her fingers.

It appears to be the same woman from the cloning vat, though it is hard to make out anything underneath the veil.

He watches for a while, seeing nothing but air and the floating Wizard.

Feanon ends the scrying and communicates what he saw to the group.  He thinks that he has scried the Lady in White.  The artificer/wizard who was running this facility and that she floats, high above, ready to snap her fingers and blow them all up.

The group agrees and they wonder what to do about it.  

As they heal up and rest, Talley re-appears from her invisibility, sweaty and pale.

Its clear that something is wrong with her.

The group attends to her and she recovers enough to continue through the Factory,

The group pushes forwards in the hope of finding some of The Lady’s Medical facilities so they can maybe help the large woman.

They find a T junction leading to a strange, crystal covered chamber with a metal mesh floor and a number of small metal detritus scattered around.

Its not an infirmary, so they ignore it and push on.

They almost find what they are looking for in the next room - bloodstained beds scattered around, clothing piled up in one corner, but its no medical facility

They are just about to give up, tearing up soiled sheets to make bandages, when Patches returns from scouting.

She’s found the Surgery room.

Talley is in a bad state at this point and they rush the large woman down the ancient stone hallways to a massive metal door that folds in on itself when unlocked.

Within the chamber, everything is made of steel and a steel table gleams under a large crystal hanging from the ceiling.

Medical tools are scattered about the room and a book can be seen amongst them.

They get Talley on the table and Gundren begins to organize the medical equipment.

In doing so, he grabs the book and is cursed…

Pulled to read the book, Gundren flips through until he finds a page showing exactly what he needs for the surgery - a detailed anatomical dissection of a human chest cavity.

The cursed book is noticed by the attentive group though.

The delicate surgery begins

They cut open Talley and see that she has numerous machina implants throughout her body.

The hub of the implants is a Sourcework core implanted into her heart.

The surgery goes on for a while and Patches moves out to the hall to keep watch.

She finds herself drawn to the hallway to her right, and the stairs down to the next level.

A voidish darkness looms in the stairway and she finds herself involuntarily moving toward it before Buumi comes out to ask her a question.

Feeling uncomfortable, Patches leads Buumi back into the Surgery room.

Gundren manages to separate the core from the implant and just as he’s about to place it in the Bag of Devouring Cirrus has, it explodes.

Talley is killed in the blast instantly

The group recovers and looks over the destruction, distraught that they couldn't save yet another…
