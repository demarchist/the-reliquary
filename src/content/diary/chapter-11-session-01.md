The group presses on, through the labyrinthine Underdark.

The day is relatively uneventful, until Feanon senses some lingering magic and leads the group to a strange sight.

They see a dead Grell being dragged across the ground, toward a vent, by a Mechanical spider, very similar to the ones from the Troll Hills.

Gundren is fascinated and moves to investigate the thing.

Feanon theorizes that the strangely well mainainted ruins here are probably the doing of the mechanical spider, a Janitor of sorts, and gestures toward the Grell being “cleaned”

Feanon wants the Grell brainstem though and has the grell disemboweled, giving the spider much more to clean and giving Feanon a window to swipe the organs of his choice.

The group decides to otherwise not invoke the ire of the mechanical spider and they move on.

After a good day of travel, the group finds themselves in well maintained ruins, far more intact than those just a day away.

Feanon sets up his mansion and the majority head inside to rest, leaving Tark, Veygar and Patches outside.

Tark goes looking for mushrooms and comes across a strange jelly-fish like creature the size of a large almond.

It introduces itself as Marge and is a Flumph.

Tark has no idea what that is but greets the being and offers it nourishment.

The creature accepts and drains some Ki from the monk.

A little surprised, Tark grumbles a bit about it, but would never let another creature go hungry.

Marge then mentions that the Elder Flumphs in the area might have more knowledge of these ruins.

Buumi exits the mansion for his watch at that point and begins praying to Helm to protect the camp.

It takes Patches too long to rouse from her Reverie to stop him and the sound of the spoken prayers echo off into the tunnels.

A roar responds as six Quaggoths rush into the cave, attacking Buumi.

Despite the sudden onslaught, they are hard pressed to get past the plate armor and shield and are held off long enough for the group to be roused.

Rushing from the mansion, the battle is quickly joined and the ape-like creatures are quickly destroyed.

The group moves the corpses off a ways, cleans the area enough to disinterest any predators and then finish up their nights rest.

The next day, they head deeper into these ancient Saurian ruins, Veygar disarming traps with his skeleton key as they go.

Veygar begins to grow discomforted and mentions that they should have met his guards by now.

The group exits the now fully carved tunnels into a large chamber of ancient design.

Constructed all around the floor of the grand cavern they find themselves in, are ancient ramparts and defenses. 

At the heart of the cavern sits a grand ancient Pyramid of black marble threaded with quartz, a pure cap of silvery metal gleams atop the pyramid in Green-hued sconce-light.

The group stands in awe for a moment and then silently they head off into the now abandoned defenses of this underground fortress.

The defenses show sign of ancient battle and the doors and smaller debris have long been cleaned away by the mechanical spiders.  Only massive damage and rocks too large for the spiders to move remain, giving the damage a “missing” feeling of detail.

Despite this, the signs of battle are extensive, though ancient.

Veygar stops the group as they are moving through a section of the fort and he says there’s no way they would not have seen his guards by now unless they were dead.

The group fans out a bit to search for clues.

It takes a while and they head deeper into the Ancient fortress.

They head through the last stretch of cavern to the foot of the grand pyramid and the single large door they can see on its surface about 20ft up a set of grand stairs.

They head inside, wary of traps but come across none.

They do finally find sign of Veygar’s guards.

A body, being dragged away by a Mechanical spider.

Not wanting to incite the spider, the group hangs back but can tell the Duergar has been dead for at least a week.

Veygar mentions he knew the fellow.

The group comes on guard, now fearing they are not alone in this place and see something gleam in the dim light of the Pyramid.

Up ahead, the tunnel is covered with cloying black, oozing webs which Cirrus burns away with a flaming sphere, revealing archways to other hallways within the pyramid.

Dead ahead though the tunnel opens up.

Heading down the entry hall, the group eventually comes into a large interior chamber within the pyramid.

Octagonal and with a large dais in the center, atop which sits two Ringed Veils - portals of ancient Saurian design.

Both gleam and glow with energy, their mirror-like gateways active, possibly to other worlds.

As the group stares at the ancient, active gateways, they move into the room, beelining for the artifacts.

Suddenly the group finds they cannot hear anything, this queues them in and they look around.

Dark robed cultists rush from the shadows, weapons drawn and attack the party.

They kill the cultists quickly, but one of them does not go down so easily; one of the creatures climbing across the ceiling.

It takes a considerable effort to down the last of the black robed enemies and leaves the group breathing heavily, surveying the battlefield.
