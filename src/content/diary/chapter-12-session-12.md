As the group walks aboard, the Captain fetches a drinking vessel as the group challenges him for free accomodations.

The captain returns moments later, grinning a confident smile.

The group pushes Tark forward to drink

Buumi riles up the crew to gather around and cheer on the competition and they set up on a barrel in the middle of the main deck.

They both start out strong, downing shot after shot of the milky white liquor

Tark is making faces, but its due to the flavor, not the alcohol.

As Captain Drizzle becomes more and more affected, the Elf asks “Are you resistant?” to Tark.

Buumi grows immediately uncomfortable because indeed, Tark is immune to the effects of alcohol.

Buumi slaps Drizzly on the shoulder, hiding the small flash of light with his bulk and cleansing the effects of the liquor on the captain.

Thinking he got himself a second wind, and now second guessing his accurate accusation, he returns to the drink reinvigorated.

Tark shrugs at the strange display and just keeps on drinking.

The crowd begins to gather and people look on from the dock as the pair drink their way well past what should physically be possible.

As the group looks on, they note the apparel of the captain, seemingly covered in trinkets and they suspect a little magic resilience.

The Captain, though clearly getting drunk, is putting back far more than he should, even after the reset by Buumi.

Eventually though, the Captain simply cannot compete against someone physically incapable of getting intoxicated and he falls off his stool.

Tark catches the man and eases him into the arms of the second mate, a Water Genasi lady with short cropped green hair and pale blue skin with a thin scar across her jawline.

As the captain is taken to his quarters to recover, the second mate;** Naima** takes over

The ship heads out of port and the group is shown below decks to the main living area to stake a claim to a hammock or spot.

The whole crew is wearing an assortment of hot weather gear so the group does not look too out of place.

Feanon finds a secluded spot to set up where he can study his spellbook without alarming the simple pirates.

Snorbul approaches the same area but the closest hammock is occupied.

Snorbul approaches the person and simply lifts them out of the hammock, intimidating the person into silence as this jacked, tiny, dark skinned and glowing red-eyed gnome lifts the pirate into another hammock.

The pirate whimpers in fear, but otherwise doesnt make a sound…

Feanon takes his time to read the **Tome of Al Azif**, the dark book he pulled from the cultists in Faerun and plies another dark spell from its pages.

Snorbul watches this and shivers as he looks at the book, but doesnt get in the Wizard’s way.

The others have all managed to find a decent spot and sleep through the night.

Save for Cirrus.

The Warlock heads to the captain’s quarters and after knocking incessantly, the door is answered by Naima.

Cirrus badgers her to wake the captain and a groggy Drizzly Dawg makes an appearance.

Cirrus pushes past into the room and as Drizzly protests and then moves to remove Cirrus, the Warlock simply Farsteps into the plush bed in the quarter.

Naima and Drizzly both try repeatedly to remove Cirrus from the bed, but the Warlock simply farsteps back into it.

Eventually in frustration, Drizzly pulls something from his ear and tosses it at the ground beneath the bed, the Portable hole dumping both the bed, and Warlock, out the overhanging back of the ship and into the ocean.

The Warlock sputters as he flounders in the cold ocean, but then Farsteps to the deck of the ship.

Dripping saltwater and shivering, he then prestidigitates himself dry.

The deck crew have all stopped and are staring at him, wide eyed.

A few mutters of “Ifrit” can be heard before they go back to their business.

Cirrus spends some time talking to the more receptive crew members, mentioning the Moon, Selune and the power of the goddess.

Cirrus then heads to a hammock, happy that if he cannot get the bed, no one can…


The next morning, the group awakes and they begin their voyage in earnest, the intense sun glittering off the ocean as they head north to round the tip of the peninsula, before heading south along the coast to Iyum.

The sun is intense, and reflection from the water turns the ship into an oven.

Buumi tries to stay below deck to stay out of the sun, but still ends up exhausted.

Some of the others stay below too, while others help out on deck.

Tark incessantly coils and organizes the ropes while Gundren actually ties the knots.

Snorbul makes himself and his incredible strength useful by hauling lines while Cirrus speaks words of encouragement to the crew (about the Moon obviously).

Liara watches the Warlock with incredulity but does not interfere, simply shaking her head.

The peaceful, though oppressive stillness of the heat is broken by a hit on the hull of the ship, then another, and another.

The hits begin to splinter wood and Naima rushes to the helm, demanding a report.

As sailors look over the side, the ship appears to be under attack from six massive, and very vicious looking Turtles.

The things seem to have confused the ship with a competitor, or maybe something they could prey upon, like a whale.

The group takes charge with Cirrus simply banishing two of them.

Buumi hauls one on deck in a fishing net and then restrains it.

Tark mans a nearby deck-gun, a larger version of the Saurian Firelance Gundren has

He fires the Cannon into the ocean, but the Turtle is underwater enough that the shot is dispersed

Eventually though, the ship manages to outpace the last turtles as Feanon makes the ship lighter in the water

Meanwhile, Buumi has been trying to slay the last Turtle on the deck...

On its back and mewling strangely, Buumi lost the will to slay this creature.

The pirates are hesitant to step forward to help after the thing almost bit the leg off one of the pirates.

Eventually though, a few come in with spears to help

Buumi finally manages to slay the thing with their help, though it takes far too long.

Unwilling to let the creature go to waste, they go about cleaning the thing for its meat to take down to the kitchen.

The shell is saved and Buumi hands the massive thing to Tark.

The halfling can easily fit inside the armored shell.

With the wildlife outpaced, the ship continues on down the coast.

On the horizon though, the clouds are growing dark

After a few hours it becomes clear, a Storm is incoming.

The pirates rush around, preparing for the storm and looking to ride the edge of it.

They put more distance between themselves and the shore.

During the storm, Feanon tries to manipulate the weight of the ship and the strain is too much on the hull.

Some of the damage from the Turtles begins to buckle and Gundren has to rush to fix it.

Several of the crew note the spellcasting and mutter about witchcraft.

With help from the group working the ropes and with Gundren fixing the boat, the ship manages to avoid the worst of the High-storm.

As the storm passes and the crew begins to breathe more easily and take stock of the ships condition, Drizzly Dawg comes on deck to survey the damage.

Seeing his chance and remembering what the group had said about trying to potentially seize the ship, Thirsty Fingers, the sailor accompanying the group from the Fiery Flower calls out the Captain for not being present for the last few crisis.

The crew gathers to listen to the new-crewmans grievances and a number of the crew do grumble in agreement.

Drizzly, smiling, says that he expected something like this from Thirsty, but he is surprised at the speed of it.

Thirsty looks to the group and gets encouragement from a few of them, though others look unsure.

Buumi especially seems to be anxious, looking around and whispering with the group against this course of action.

Let no good crisis go unused though.

Thirsty calls for a public vote and discourse.

Thirsty and Dawg take the stage and make their case to the crew

Thirsty puts forth that the Captain is a drunk and neglected his duties because of it

Dawg puts forth that he was hung over due to an illegitimate contest - espousing that he believes Tark was indeed resistant to the alcohol - something though that several of the crew find to be a stretch at best.

Seeing that his superstitious crew likely wouldn't understand poison resistance and magic items, Captain Dawg changes tactics.

He points out that Thirsty, while a well known scallawag in pirate circles, came aboard with this strange group of outsiders, one of which could very well be an Ifrit (he gestures at Cirrus).

Several of the grew grumble at that, muttering about witchcraft and spellcasting.

One even goes so far as to point out all the bad luck they’ve had since they came aboard…

Dawg then pointedly reminds his crew that many of them were once Serfs or other downtrodden folk and he has helped all of them find better lives.

This resonates with many and as the votes begin to be tallied, only about ¼ of the crew end up supporting Thirsty (mostly new crew) and the rest remain with the captain.

Drizzly smiles and offers a deal in gracious victory for Thirsty - he knows of a vessel, almost begging to be stolen.

Along the coast, in a natural bay is a large island dominated by a stone structure

There, a ship is moored in pristine condition and never moves.

Dawg says that he meant to steal it on this trip himself, but it’s Thirsty’s and any crew that wishes can go with him.

He holds out his hand to Thirsty, even asking if, when he gets the new ship, they might be the start of a fleet?

Thirsty grins and shakes Dawgs hand and looks back at the group.

He sees a mix of shock, anxiety and a few smiles of approval.

Buumi, looking pale and a bit sickly, visibly relaxes as the situation diffuses, the Paladin having been wrestling with the potential morality of the situation.

The crew breaks up, discussing the exciting event and the cleanup from the storm finally resumes…
