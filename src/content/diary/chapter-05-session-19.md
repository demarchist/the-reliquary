The Sanctum of Argynvost has not seen people for over 1400 years, but now it is veritably crowded.  Mordenkainen reclines in a plush chair, reviewing and re-reading his re aquired spellbook with stick leaning up against a nearby shelf while Ezmerelda sits at the large oak table, sequestered in one wing of the chamber, looking tired and unsure, glancing at the group occasionally.  Mr. Pickles has fallen asleep against the wall near the huge bed, his heavy crossbow across his lap and further along the wall.  Near the treasure, Chekhov is curled fast asleep at its foot, in awe of the mounds of coins and gems and behind him around the fire lay the great Wartigers.  The group settles down and rests, secure and safe in a chamber that has eluded Strahd for more than a millenia.

  The group takes stock of their situation.    Tark and Patches check on Buumi, but the injured Paladin does not stir and while breathing steadily, is pale and clammy.    JmJm sits silently against the far wall, staring at the corpse of Steven before falling into a deep mournful sleep.

Take long rest

Urwen takes his leave, saying he has to get his family out of Vallaki as the Wild Hunt was dangerously close to the city.  Says he will meet the group at The Wizard of the Wines and gets Fey to teleport him to Tsolenka pass using the ring (Morden is busy with his spellbook).

during long rest, Morden studies spellbook

Tark checks on Buumi again, he's looking better.  Buumi wakes for a moment, saying his arm itches, Tark gives him some encouragement and Buumi falls back asleep.

Stick detects strange emanations from JmJm

group investigates and Artifact is missing

wish spell from Strahd has taken it

Stick notes that he thinks he gets why Barovia is so strange

two previous wish spells interacting oddly with the demi-plane - causing time rubber banding and Ireenas seemingly random ressurections and deaths.

Strahd is powerful enough and The Amber temple has the spell, so why wouldn't he have tried to wish himself out before, turns out he did and it went badly.

Ireena freely admits that she thinks she is Tatyana, the evidence is just overwhelming at this point.

Group contemplates using their own wish to resurrect Sergei, Strahd's long dead brother

Patches wonders about using the Dream messenger spell to contact Strahd and present the evidence.

The group contemplates disguising themselves AS Sergei to talk to Strahd, but Stick points out that trying to con the Vampire lord might be counter-productive.

Morden also brings up that he doesnt know if what Vampires call "sleep" is close enough to actual sleep for the spell to work.

Patches debates this, saying sleep is sleep and Morden scoffs at her lack of knowledge, mentioning that he should have expected as much from a Rogue

Incensed, patches gets up in his face, pulling out Stabby and everyone gets nauseous, he demands she put it away which she does and uses the distraction to pick his pocket, taking his pipe.  Catching the slight of hand as it was happening, Morden tries to counter-swipe with a Mage hand, but Patches is too fast and she slaps the hand away.  Morden lets out a laugh and Patches hands the pipe back and they share a smoke.

decide to wait for now and deal with Baba Lysaga and the Crystal greatsword first (which Morden slots back together with the hilt and it clicks, but it's spark has expired).

ask again about the Celestial in Krezk and confirm that there is one there.

Fey uses his scrying spell, as he does the entity in his ring lashes out at him

Scry's the Celestial using the crystal greatsword as a focus, a beautiful young man of caramel complexion and glacial blue eyes, dancing with a woman that looks strikingly like Ireena.  The celestial notices the scrying and beckons to Fey to come see him.

Fey reports what he sees as it's happening, Ireena is just not shocked by anything at this point and accepts the likeness of herself existing.

Morden thinks that Ireena's memory could be restored by Fey doing a Deep Dive now that they have items connected to her past life (journals and Sergei's sword).

Take Ireena to the table and sit her down with the Sword in both hands.

Fey puts his hands on her shoulders and slides his mask onto his face and dives into her mind.

Proceeds to work backward through each death and resurrection - seeing dozens of deaths by Rahadin and monsters, going back more than a millennia

Sees the first death, of her first life, having been lured to the top of Ravenloft.  Rahadin throws her from the tower without a word, no explanation.  She dies confused, murdered by a man she considered a dear friend.

Ireena is overwhelmed by the memories, the trauma of the deaths and her mind begins shutting down and breaking.  Fey and Cirrus react quickly, calming her emotions and charming her to insulate her mind against the shock.  After many minutes of Fey remaining in her mind to insulate it and subtle castings from Cirrus and he, Ireena begins to recover.

She confirms Rahadin is her long time murderer, killing her repeatedly.  She's pissed, and quite damaged from the ordeal.

Group decides to get the greatsword fixed first, to fight Rahadin.

Tark mentions that he wants the sword for Strahd.  Despite Rahadins manipulation, Strahd has still done terrible things for which he must atone.  The group argues this, debating the innocence of even Rahadin as he was corrupted by the Atropal from the Amber Temple.  Is he too not a victim??

They decide to put the question of innocence on hold as having a powerful weapon against their enemies is too beneficial to ignore.

Morden announces that the group has forgotten one loose end he intends to go fix - Exethanter the Lich at the Amber Temple.

announces he will Invis, Teleport to Amber temple ring, time stop, permanent Storm Sphere to prevent new teleports in, find the lich and disintegrate, smash the phylactery using Sticks info, Wall of force the ceiling to ensure the structure remains intact, then exit the temple and drop thousands of tons of stone and snow over the entrance to seal it.

Fey is livid at this plan, hating the destruction of such a beautiful Arcane repository and structure and the loss of knowledge.

Morden appreciates the loss, but believes that leaving the possibility of such powerful enemies behind them, and possible returning to Oerth is too great a threat to leave alone. and opts for Overkill.

Morden turns to leave - teleporting to the Amber Temple but is stopped by Patches and Cirrus

Patches possession the night before is brought up, asking if Morden had heard of an entity called Lenanshidhe as that was the name Rahadin called out just before Patches was possessed by her weapon.

Morden has not heard of it, but Stick and Cirrus recalls that it is the name of an Arch-Fey, sometimes call The Hag Queen and is a noble of the Winter Court of the Unseelie Fey.

Cirrus and Patches are disturbed by this, and Morden casts Mind Blank on Patches to protect her from Stabby before he finally leaves The Sanctum. 

The group asks after Buumi, Tark mentions that he seems to be doing well

group then asks Ireena and Ez what they plan on doing - all NPC's and Aurora remain in the Sanctum rather than putting themselves in harms way after what they saw at the castle

The group gathers in the Teleportation circle and head to Morden's Mansion on the slopes of Mt. Baratok, from there they plan on heading to the walled village of Krezk.

They appear in Morden's Mansion, the place is deserted but is still brightly lit, a fresh meal has appeared on the dining table and peoples Bags of holding are placed in safe storage.

the group does not dally, and heads out immediately, as they head for the door, Cirrus hands Patches a Ring of Warmth as she frequently had the worst time with the cold

The group exits and finds themselves high up the mountain in the ever-present blizzard, they retrieve their bags of holding from the safety chest and head down the mountain on a mix of summoned mounts, Kitty and Tark simply leaping along.

Everyone braves the storm well except Fey, finding that even the brief time in the blizzard numbs his hands.

Making it down, out of the ever present blizzard, but above the tree line, the group gets a solid view of the Valley and what they see makes their hearts sink.

The Wild Hunt whirls over the city of Vallaki as it burns beneath them - the city is all but destroyed.

The huge bat form of Peytr can be seen flying above the city

Argynvostholt is gone, the mansion destroyed - but the pillar of light remains.

A dark vortex of storm clouds and whirling energy circles above Ravenloft castle in an inverted funnel.

All the dark things and monsters of the valley are being called to the castle, in preparation for its return to the mortal world.

Fey takes a moment to warm himself up and receives some blessings from Cirrus, the numbness in his hands leaves and the group begins their descent, heading west.

Making the tree line after another hour or so, the group heads into the trees, but stop short as off in the distance, they notice many spirits moving in the direction of the castle

Tark draws shadow around the group and they wait for the spectral procession to pass.  Just as they begin to travel, they almost run straight into the massive form of an undead frost giant, but let it go past, avoiding conflict.

Almost an hour later, the group makes it to the Edge of the Svalich woods and a small pond/lake with an old decrepit tower in the middle on a small island.  Intrigued, but with little time to spare, the group ignores it and heads down a path to the main road.

Arriving at the road, off in the distance they spot a single figure  - Growland, one of the Vampire adventurers, but the Vampires do not spot the group with Tarks spell around them.

The group veers off the path, and despite being mounted, the shadow and silence wrapped around them by Tark makes them all but invisible to the Vampire adventurers out looking for the group.

The group bypasses the Vampires and heads west to Krezk.

Heading west, an hour later the group leaves the trees for good, getting higher along the start of what appears to be a mountain pass out of the Valley.  Ahead of them is the walled Village of Krezk, built atop a rocky spur and the Abbey of St. Markovia high above on it's pinnacle.

Approaching the the village cautiously, the group heads to the main gate which is closed and guarded by a half dozen militia - they appear distressed and terrified as they see The Wild Hunt in the distance and the glow of burning Vallaki beneath them.

The group is spotted approaching the main gate, but are barred entry.

Having no time for such things, Tark leaps to the parapet to convince the guards he is no threat.

The guards draw their weapons and try to strike at Tark, but he keeps swatting their strikes away or pushing their swords back into their sheaths and the guards get exasperated.

Eventually, bows and guns are drawn on the group and the Burgomaster is summoned - with Tark leaping down to greet him

Still unwelcoming and demanding the group leaves, the group gives up and decides to simply bypass the wall entirely as Cirrus' own reports the Celestial is still in the Abbey above the village.

Tark begins leaping up the rocky outcropping and Cirrus transforms into a giant raven, carrying Patches and Fey up to the abbey.

Patches has Kitty return to the tree line and wait for them

As they are bypassing the gates, the guards open fire on the group, missing or only grazing their targets.

As the group looks behind them, they see an Einherjar patrol turn and gallop back to the main body of The Hunt - to summon Peytr to Krezk...

The group makes it to the Abbey and lands in the main courtyard - a desolate rocky place, dusted in snow.

The owl reports the Celestial coming to greet the group.

The Abbot enters into the courtyard, welcoming the group by first name, and warmly.

He introduces himself as Anduriel and welcomes the group

a figure darkens the door to the courtyard and the group sees a striking likeness of Ireena, but devoid of any emotion

On close inspection, the likeness appears to be a Flesh Golem or construct

When questioned, Anduriel says he created her as a more resilient vessel for Ireena, thinking that if he could return Strahd's wife to him, it might lift the curse and save the people of the valley - Lathanders faithful.

Anduriel reveals he is a Planetar of Lathander and reveals his wings, a set of six, cream feathered angel wings sprout from his back and his eyes glow a soft blue.

The group finds the Angels goals...odd, but ignore it.  Instead, bringing up the current issues in the Valley and Tark shows Anduriel the Crystal Greatsword.

Anduriel is amazed by the blade, thinking it long lost and laments it no longer holds any power

Anduriel shows concern about the current state of the Valley, but not overly so, still holding to his original plan

The group implores the Angel to help them empower the weapon

they discover that to do so would require the death of the Angel as it would need to be fully drawn into the weapon - something Anduriel is unwilling to do

The group continues to try and persuade the Angel unsuccessfully.

The angel turns from his contemplation to announce to the group that he will NOT surrender his grace to the blade and wishes to continue with his Golem plan

He sees The Wild Hunt bearing down on Krezk and his eyes go wide in shock and horror

Realizing the dire situation, that he and Krezk are about to be destroyed (Even a Planetar would be overwhelmed by the army he sees), he relents and offers to join the blade.

Presenting his chest, Anduriel tells Tark to impale him with the sword, drawing his essence into the blade.

Tark runs over and impales the Angel and glowing cracks begin to spread over the man as he is drawn into the sword (slowly).

Tark and Anduriel are buffeted by wind and energy as the process begins

The Wild Hunt bears down on the group, bypassing the fortifications of the town on their flying, spectral steeds.

Skeletons leading, but with Vampires right behind, the group finds themselves defending Tark and Anduriel while the sword is charged.

Fey, who had been inscribing a Teleportation circle as an escape route, finishes and turns to fight.

The battle above the walled village of Krezk begins.

Several waves of mounted skeletons and Vampire warrior-Thralls come charging in, backed up by two Vampire Champions and Peytr in his bat form.

They loose a large volley of arrows, with the skeletons wheeling off for another pass, while the Vampires charge straight in at Patches, Fey, Cirrus and the defenseless Tark.

Backpedaling from the front-lines, Fey forces the cavalry charge to break into two forces as he splits them with a summoned cloudkill - skeletal forms roiling in the summoned mists.

Patches steps forward and hurls one of her flashbombs in front of the charging enemies as they get near ground level, while dealing radiant damage, the bomb had also been rigged to spray out Holy Water and the detonation rips into the vulnerable Vampires, disintegrating their horses and throwing them to the ground with bone-breaking force. Where Patches then steps in to dispatch the survivors with her weapons.

Cirrus adds to the hazards by creating a Sickening Radiance, further driving the enemy force apart, catching the second wave of skeletons and destroying many, and catching the trailing edge of the already devastated first charge of Vampires.

The second wave of Vampires charges around the Sickening Radiance, not having seen what happened to their comrades and similarly bear down of the group, unleshing a volley of arrows at Patches and Tark, wounding them lightly.

Patches hurls the second of her flash bombs and takes out the entire contingents mounts causing them to crash to the ground before the group.

Seeing such a tempting target of prone, wounded Vampires, Fey unleashes a blast of fire and incinerates every enemy in the blast radius of his fireball - including the two surviving skeleton archers that got hit by the sickening Radiance.

One of the Vampire champions dashes past Patches, above her head and striking a glancing blow with his lance but she Ripostes, slaying his mount as he rides overhead, causing him to be thrown through the edge of Cirrus' spell and causing the Vampire to burn from the light.

Peytr and the other Champion have flanked, bypassing the Mist and Radiance, and another wave of Skeletons and Vampires charge in, but Fey unleashes a hypnotic pattern as they try, but Peytr shrugs it off, waking the Champion by him that succumbed.  The first champion however is dazed by it.

The flesh Golem of Ireena still stands in the doorway, oblivious as Anduriel is absorbed by the holy Greatsword.

Fey and Cirrus back up as far from the enemies as possible and using what cover they can, anticipating more bow shots and Peytr's whirling ax.

The unmounted Champion is hit by several Eldritch blasts from Cirrus, and he rushes to cover to let his regeneration heal him.

The Archers ride back in, loosing another volley at Patches and Tark, who take several more grazes despite Patches deflection and dodging.

Peytr transforms into his humanoid form, landing next to the second champion who has voluntarily dismounted.  As they do, Slippy, the Frog Golem causes what little plant growth is in the area to become overgrown and entangling, creating difficult terrain.

Peytr hurls his ax at Fey, and the whirling blade bludgeons the elf to the ground.  The ax embeds itself in the wall behind him and nearby archers loose upon the mage.  Arrows smash into Fey's protections, but the effort of maintaining his magic causes him to lose consciousness under the assault.

More Skeletons come riding in as the Vampires split, half coming in with the skeletons, and the others coming in with Peytr and the unnamed champions.

Cirrus calls upon his staff and a streaking pea of fire lashes out at Peytr and the supporting Vampires, detonating in a fireball.  Two of the charging warriors are knocked from their mounts and the others take serious burns.  Calling upon the moon Goddess, Cirrus motions at his downed companion and Fey's eyes flicker open as he returns to consciousness, invigorated by the celestial healing.

Patches and Tark are charged and surrounded by Vampires and the Archers keep up the pressure, hitting Cirrus and Fey when they cant hit Patches and Tark.

Patches ducks under one charging horse, slaying it and causing the vampire to tumble, and using her dexterity, arrives behind another to stab him in the back.

Anduriel is almost completely cracked and light is pouring from him.

Peytr and the second champion transform into bats and fly out of the difficult terrain, transforming back into humanoid forms as they touch down on the other side of the plant growth.

Another wave of vampires comes galloping in.

Seeing more enemies coming Fey casts Blur on himself and then rushes into the doorway, using the Flesh Golem as cover as two of the Vampires around Tark turn to strike at him.  One Vampire slays another as the blow is redirected by Fey's magic and the other strikes land on  the mindless Golem.

Anduriel explodes in a blaze of light and the beacon of Argynvostholt rushes from the distance, burning through the attacking army, and flows into the sword which glows with sunlight.  Patches hears a voice in her mind, warning her to look away just before the sunburst and she whips off her Piwafwi to shield it from the damaging light.  The sword names itself Ashbringer.

Blazing greatsword in hand and with the mind of Anduriel and Argynvost inside it, Tark swing the weapon with great proficiency, rushing Peytr and the Champion.  The light from the sword burns the vampires as Tark approaches and they flinch away, exposed flesh bubbling under the holy radiance.

Tark attacks Peytr, slashing and gouging the vampire with the holy blade. Peytr leaps back, away from the sunlight blade.

Tark turns and shadowsteps to a nearby injured Vampire, using the harsh shadows cast from the blade.  Slashing, Tark cuts the unfortunate creature in half, causing it to detonate in a flash of sunlight.  As the vampires ashes are blown outward, motes of the ash and the blistering sunburst burns another nearby skeleton, which in turn detonates.

A chain reaction begins, as each detonation causes more destruction and a cascade of brilliant sunbursts travel along the charging army and up into the night sky as hundreds of undead are destroyed.

Peytr is knocked from his bat form as he flew back in and the nearby champion and he recoil in pain and horror from the Sunbursts.  The second champion falls to the ground writhing under it's sunlight blistering skin, where Cirrus dispatches it with a quick Eldritch bolt.

Patches rushes at Peytr, dodging his blows and engages the huge barbarian as Tark is encircled by some charging Vampires.

Two more waves of Vampire warriors and a wave of skeletons charge down out of the ash-filled sky, the nearest circling Tark, the others charging in behind.

Patches is flanked by the first Champion that had long stood stupefied.  The two vampires, despite Patches incredible agility and swordsmanship, chip away at the Drows stamina.  After a few moments, one glancing blow and then another hit the lithe elf.

Seeing a wave of Vampires about to rush in at her, Patches drops a globe of darkness over herself and disengages from the distracted Vampires.

Patches darts into cover behind the well and prepares a healing potion.

Peytr growls in frustraton and turns, hurling his ax and gouging the Teleportation circle Fey had prepared as the groups escape.

Surrounded by enemies and despite the burning sunlight, several blows get through Tarks defense, hurting him badly.  He sees the darkness cast by Patches and Shadowsteps from his predicament to assault Peytr.

As Tark appears, leaping out of the darkness at the Vampire Barbarian, the searing light from from the blade burns the remaining champion to ash, detonating in a radiant flash.  As the light from the detonation burns all the nearby undead, it begins another chain reaction, wiping out every enemy nearby and rippling up into the sky.

Peytr screams in pain as the flesh is burned from his bones, which then too blacken, crack and are blown away into a cloud of ash.

Tark hears in his head "leave nothing but ash in your wake..."

The remains of the Wild Hunt turn and flee, unwilling to face the Ashbringer: the sword, and now Tark.

all that remains, other than a good six inches of ash floating down like a blizzard from the sky, is Peytr's vile Obsidian ax and in a pile of ashes...

The group hears cheering from the village below, and as they look over the edge, they see villagers below cheering up at them having witnessed the incredible
