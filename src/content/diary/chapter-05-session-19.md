## The Sanctum

Argynvost's sanctum had not seen living souls in over fourteen hundred years. Now it was crowded: Mordenkainen studying his recovered spellbook with Stick leaning against a shelf; Ezmerelda, tired and uncertain, sequestered at the oak table; Mr. Pickles asleep against the wall, crossbow across his lap; Chekhov curled at the foot of the treasure pile; the war tigers sprawled by the fire. JmJm sat silent against the far wall, staring at Steven's remains.

The group discovered the artifact shard was gone — wished away by Strahd through the power of the Amber Temple. Stick theorised that two previous Wish spells were interacting strangely with the demiplane, causing the time distortions and Ireena's seemingly random deaths and resurrections.

Ireena accepted the overwhelming evidence quietly. She was Tatyana.

The group debated using their own Wish to resurrect Sergei and present the truth to Strahd. But first they needed the celestial greatsword — reforged and whole — to fight Rahadin. Mordenkainen confirmed the celestial presence in Krezk and left to destroy the Amber Temple, casting Mind Blank on Patches to protect her from the Reaver before he went.

## Ireena's Memories

Fëanon sat Ireena at the table with Sergei's crystal sword in both hands. He placed his hands on her shoulders, slid on his mask, and dove into her mind.

He worked backward through each death and resurrection — dozens of them stretching back more than a millennium. Each time, Rahadin was the killer. Monsters, accidents, blades in the dark — all orchestrated by the chamberlain to prevent Tatyana's soul from ever reaching Strahd. The very first death was the simplest: Rahadin had thrown her from the highest tower of Ravenloft without a word. She died confused, murdered by a man she had considered a dear friend.

Ireena's mind began shutting down under the trauma. Fëanon and Cyrrus worked frantically to insulate her with calming magic and charms. After many minutes, she stabilised — damaged, furious, but herself. She confirmed Rahadin as her murderer across the centuries.

## Krezk and the Planetar

Urwen departed to evacuate his family from Vallaki — the Wild Hunt was dangerously close to the city. The NPCs, Ireena included, remained in the sanctum. The group teleported to Mordenkainen's mountaintop sanctum, then descended into the valley.

What they saw crushed their spirits. Vallaki burned beneath the circling Wild Hunt. Argynvostholt was rubble, though the pillar of light remained. A dark vortex of storm clouds spiralled above Castle Ravenloft. Every dark creature in the valley was being called to the castle — Strahd was preparing to return to the mortal world.

They crept west through the Svalich woods, wrapped in Tark's shadow magic, bypassing undead giants and spectral processions. At the walled village of Krezk, the militia refused them entry. Tark leapt to the parapet and tried to convince the guards he was friendly by swatting their sword strikes away and pushing blades back into sheaths. When bows were drawn, the group gave up and simply flew over the walls to the Abbey of St. Markovia on the pinnacle above.

The Abbot met them in the courtyard, addressing each by name. He introduced himself as Anduriel — a Planetar of Lathander — and revealed six cream-feathered wings from his back, his eyes glowing soft blue. Behind him stood a flesh golem constructed in Ireena's likeness, devoid of emotion.

When shown the crystal greatsword, Anduriel was amazed but saddened — it was powerless. To reforge it required the death of a celestial, its grace drawn fully into the blade. Anduriel refused.

The group argued. The angel held firm. Then he turned and saw the Wild Hunt bearing down on Krezk, an army of darkness that would overwhelm even a Planetar.

He relented. He presented his chest and told Tark to impale him.

## The Battle of Krezk

Tark drove the blade through the angel and glowing cracks spread across Anduriel's form as his essence began flowing into the sword. Energy and wind buffeted them both. The process was agonisingly slow.

The Wild Hunt attacked. Waves of mounted skeletons and vampire warriors descended, backed by two vampire champions and Peytr in his bat form. Fëanon split the cavalry charge with a summoned cloudkill. Patches hurled holy-water-rigged flashbombs that disintegrated spectral steeds and sent vampires crashing to the ground. Cyrrus laid down sickening radiance.

The second wave charged around the barriers. More flashbombs from Patches, more fireballs from Fëanon. One vampire champion was dazed by a hypnotic pattern. Peytr hurled his axe into Fëanon, dropping the elf, then archers finished the job with a volley — but Cyrrus healed him back to consciousness with celestial magic.

More waves came. Patches ducked under charging horses, slew mounts, and stabbed riders from behind. Fëanon cast blur and used the flesh golem as cover.

Anduriel exploded.

The beacon of Argynvostholt streaked across the valley and poured into the sword, which blazed with sunlight. In Patches' mind, a voice warned her to look away. She ripped off her piwafwi to shield it from the holy light. The sword named itself: *Ashbringer.*

Tark swung the blazing greatsword and charged Peytr. Every vampire flinched from the approaching radiance, their flesh bubbling. Tark slashed the barbarian and shadowstepped to a wounded vampire nearby, cutting it in half. The vampire detonated in a flash of sunlight — which ignited the next undead, which ignited the next.

A chain reaction of sunbursts ripped through the charging army and up into the night sky. Hundreds of undead were destroyed in seconds. Peytr was knocked from bat form by the cascading detonations. The surviving champion writhed under blistering skin until Cyrrus put him down. Tark heard a voice in his mind: *"Leave nothing but ash in your wake."*

Patches rushed Peytr, trading blows with the huge barbarian while Tark shadowstepped using the harsh shadows cast by the Ashbringer's own radiance. A final strike sent Peytr detonating in a sunburst that rippled outward, destroying every remaining undead in range.

The Wild Hunt broke and fled. Six inches of grey-black ash drifted down from the sky like a blizzard. From the village below, cheering rose up through the settling cinders.
