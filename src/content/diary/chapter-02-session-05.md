The group awoke to Fey'Anon's magical alarm - his time piece set for 7:30 am

Annoyed at being woken up, the group ambles around getting ready for the day.  Fey decides to sleep in

After the adventures of the night before, and Gundren is absent, but the ring of hammers sound from the forge room, The Rockseekers must be up to something.  Buumi is passed out on the couch, recovering from a hangover.

The group notices tark, sitting in the corner meditating and heads over to investigate.  Patches attempts to mess with him, but is astonished by his focus and discipline, and draws an intricate eye sigil on his forehead.  JmJm works to spike Tarks mohawk and beard.  Drunkenly Buumi wanders over and blesses him too.  Fearing for her tournament

Bout later in the day, Lothli requests a similar treatment, and receives several boons and buffs.

Tark awakes, surprised by the benefits bestowed upon him by his companions.  The group then heads off  to the festival to win both the Archery tournament and the Martial tournament.  Things are tense, as the Tark better his new magical ring that Lothli would win the Archery Tournament.  The group makes their way through the bustling city of Neverwinter, heading with the flowing crowds to the festival.  The group decides to take on the Archery tournament first and head over to the range.  Seeing a band of adventurers wishing to shoot, Elariel the elven proprieter asks if they would wish to compete.  Patches, JmJm and Lothli each participate, but when Elariel mentions the entry fee, JmJm was having none of it and beautifully rhymed his disbelief at such a stiff fee and convinced her to let us in free of charge!

The following tournament would have the citizens of Neverwinter abuzz with excitement.  Of the many participants, three stood out as exceptional, one was a flamboyant half elf with fuzzy boots, a strange cloak and a hand crossbow that he fired with exciting flair, at one point even shimmering like a hundred thousand sequins. Another, was a cloaked and hooded in secrecy, being followed by a smaller hooded figure who served her tea, near the end, the large figure threw off her cloak to reveal herself as a Drow!!  The third was a beautiful but road-dirty elven ranger, with a gleaming mythril breastplate with a worked Dragon relief.  Despite one or two missed shots, both the elf and drow performed admirably and had several spectacular shots.  The Half Elf Bard however hit every target and with incredible flair.  At the end however, JmJm declared that he in fact cheated! Getting disqualified and landing Lothli in the lead, winning the tournament, being asked to return the next day for her magical quiver prize.  The group also won their wager with the thieves guild and went over to cvollect their winnings from Benny the Halfling.

Benny laughed when he saw the group, mentioning he didn’t think we were so crafty as to rig the fight.  He respected the groups boldness and beckoned for a small wooden chest.  The group were initially cautious, but opened it after a second, seeing racks of gold coins, a number of platinum chits and two gold cards stamped with the guild mark.  Benny paid them 10,000 gold and two Black-Market tokens in exchange for us doing them a favor.  Benny mentions that the start of that favor could be shutting up Jesmond of Canderberry in regards to Raylen the Moon Elf…

The Group agrees and takes their reward and heads over to the Martial Arts Tournament.

Now 10,000 gold richer, the group heads to the tournament with springs in their steps.   Arriving at the tournament around noon, the group sees a large crowd gathering and the combatants are ushered to the waiting room.  There they see their opponents stretching and getting ready for their bouts.  Moot approaches Tark to wish him luck and claims he will see him in the final.  Gasciogne, Patches adversary looks pale and shaky on his feet.  Verith the knight appears calm and ready for combat against Tark.  Hendrell, champion of the moonwood, looks impassive as he goes through his practice attack routines with his two longswords.  The announcer comes into the back room to get the fighters for the next few bouts and the group steps out onto the arena.  Buumi is sulking that he missed the sign-ups, JmJm and Dr.B are down near the arena in the guest section trying to figure out how to help their friends.  Looking at the situation, JmJm attempts to rile up the crowd, but fails miserably and instead plans on casting some under-the radar spells.  Doc.B studies the fighters and notices a hawk circling overhead, cawing and calling to Hendrell of the moonwood, which gives her an idea.

Lothli faces off against Hendrell, Champion of the Moonwood, and a veteran of the War for the Silver Marches.  Tark against Verith, a human knight of the sacked Sundabar and Patches against Gasciogne, a human martial artist from Silverymoon.  Lothli battled valiantly, using her short sword to the best of her abilities, defending cunningly and landing many good, but glancing hits against Hendrell.  With Hendrell's skill, Lothli could never land a strong enough hit to truly damage him, but the hits he gave in return were precise and strong.  At a particularly dire moment, a frantic bird call eminates from above, thinking it's his eagle companion,Hendrell, distracted, glances around.  The moments distraction costed him and he got smacked solidly for his foolishness.  Returning to the fight with renwed fervor, he quickly ends the battle, knocking Lothli to the ground in defeat.

Despite the fake bird call, Doc.B could not distract Hendrell enough to give Lothli a fighting chance.  Tark and Verith exchanged savage blows.  Verith's shield work however was fantastic, and although he can't hit him, Tark cannot get past the shield either.  Cunningly, Tark centers himself and strikes powerfully against the wooden shield…splintering and cracking it, causing it to fall apart.  Panicking and backing up, Verith re-centers himself and charges right back in, Longsword in both hands.  Striking powerfully and quickly, Tark takes several wicked blows and looks to be in a dire situation.  JmJm strikes! Verith becomes afflicted with a madness spell and throws his sword aside, charging Tark with his bare hands.  Now unarmed, Gasciogne stands no chance. Tark takes him down in a full assault, pummeling Verith to the ground and defeat.

Patches charges her opponent, the one she got drunk the night before.  Having difficulty, Gasciogne strikes at Patches, but misses badly, patches twin weapons hammering into the man.  A few minutes of exchanges and one or two lucky hits landing on Patches, she finally takes the monk down in a flourish.

Hendrell helps up Lothli, showing a chivalrous and kind side.  The group relocates to the Combatant tent, where Moot and Lord Penterghast prepare to battle…
