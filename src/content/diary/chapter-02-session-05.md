The group awoke to Fëanon's magical alarm — his timepiece set for 7:30 AM. Annoyed at being roused, the group ambled around getting ready. Fëanon decided to sleep in. Gundren was absent, but the ring of hammers from the forge room suggested the Rockseekers were busy with something. Buumi was passed out on the couch, recovering from a hangover.

## Blessings and Preparations

The group noticed Tark sitting in a corner meditating and went to investigate. Patches attempted to mess with him but was astonished by his focus and instead drew an intricate eye sigil on his forehead. JmJm spiked Tark's mohawk and beard. Buumi staggered over and blessed him. Lothli, nervous about her tournament bout, requested similar treatment and received several boons and buffs.

Tark awoke, pleasantly surprised by the benefits bestowed by his companions. The group headed to the festival, tension high — Tark had bet his new magical ring that Lothli would win the archery tournament.

## The Archery Tournament

The group decided to tackle archery first. Elariel, the elven proprietor, offered to let them compete — but when she mentioned the entry fee, JmJm rhymed his disbelief in such beautiful verse that she let the group in free of charge.

The tournament electrified the citizens of Neverwinter. Three competitors stood out among the many participants. First was a flamboyant half-elf with fuzzy boots, a strange cloak, and a hand crossbow he fired with incredible flair — at one point shimmering like a hundred thousand sequins. Second was a figure cloaked in secrecy, followed by a smaller hooded attendant who served her tea; near the end, she threw off her cloak to reveal herself as a Drow. Third was a beautiful but road-dirty elven ranger with a gleaming mithril breastplate worked with a dragon relief.

Despite a missed shot or two, both the elf and the Drow performed admirably with several spectacular shots. The half-elf bard hit every target with incredible style. At the end, however, JmJm declared that the bard had cheated. Disqualified, the bard's removal left Lothli in the lead — winning the tournament and earning an invitation to return the next day for her magical quiver prize.

## Collecting the Winnings

The group headed to the thieves' guild pavilion to collect their 10,000 gold wager from Benny. The halfling laughed when he saw them, remarking that he hadn't expected them to be crafty enough to rig the fight. He respected the boldness. From a small wooden chest, he produced racks of gold coins, a number of platinum chits, and two gold cards stamped with the guild mark. Ten thousand gold and two black-market tokens — in exchange for the group doing them a favor. Benny mentioned that the start of that favor could be shutting up Jasmond of Canderberry about Raylen the Moon Elf. The group agreed and took their reward.

## The Martial Tournament

Now 10,000 gold richer, the group arrived at the tournament arena around noon. A large crowd was gathering and the combatants were ushered to the waiting room. Their opponents were stretching and preparing. Moot approached Tark to wish him luck, claiming he'd see him in the final. Gasciogne, Patches' adversary, looked pale and shaky on his feet — the effects of last night's drinking. Verith the knight appeared calm and ready. Hendrell, Champion of the Moonwood, went through practice routines with his two longswords, impassive and focused.

Buumi sulked that he'd missed the sign-ups. JmJm and Doctor Breakfast took seats in the guest section near the arena, JmJm planning to cast some under-the-radar spells while Doctor Breakfast studied the fighters. She noticed a hawk circling overhead, calling to Hendrell — which gave her an idea.

## Lothli vs. Hendrell

Lothli faced off against Hendrell, a veteran of the War for the Silver Marches. She fought valiantly with her shortsword, defending cunningly and landing many good hits — but Hendrell's skill was another level entirely. His strikes were precise and powerful, while hers were mostly glancing blows. At a dire moment, Doctor Breakfast mimicked Hendrell's eagle companion's cry from above. Distracted, Hendrell glanced around — the momentary lapse cost him a solid hit. But he returned to the fight with renewed ferocity and quickly ended the bout, knocking Lothli to the ground.

## Tark vs. Verith

Tark and Verith exchanged savage blows. Verith's shield work was fantastic — Tark couldn't land a solid hit, but neither could the knight get past Tark's defenses. Cunningly, Tark centered himself and struck powerfully against the wooden shield, splintering and cracking it until it fell apart. Panicking briefly, Verith regained composure and charged back with his longsword in both hands, landing several wicked blows that put Tark in a dire state. Then JmJm struck — afflicting Verith with a madness spell that caused him to throw his sword aside and charge Tark bare-handed. Now unarmed, the knight stood no chance. Tark pummeled him to the ground.

## Patches vs. Gasciogne

Patches charged her hungover opponent. Gasciogne swung and missed badly, and Patches hammered into him with both weapons. After a few exchanges and one or two lucky hits landing on Patches, she took the monk down in a flourish.

Hendrell helped Lothli to her feet, showing a chivalrous side despite their contest. The group relocated to the combatant tent, where Moot and Lord Penterghast prepared for their own bout.
