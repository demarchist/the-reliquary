The group soars across the darkening skies, carried by the Wind.

Breezing across the desert, the group eventually sees the standing stone on the Horizon that Samid directed Doc to.

The group lands and Doc has the group reform just on the other side of a ridge.

Slippy, the Jade frog and Patches head off into the night to scout.

Samid kinda mumbles a bit, only just now realizing the sort of powers he is dealing with.

Patches and slippy head over the ridge and close enough to the monolith to determine a great ruckus did indeed occur here - there are Bedine offerings scattered all over the place.

Pulling out her spyglass, Patches spots Slippy returning to the camp after spotting something.  

She looks at the same spot and sees it too: A massive centipede like Sandworm.

They return to the group and inform them.

Itching to blast something, Gundren takes a sniper position on the ridge and Patches takes out her crossbow.

They ask Samid how tough these worms are and he responds that they normally have to kill them with cavalry and lances and even then, their acid vomit is deadly.

Patches wagers for Samid’s alcohol flask that they can kill the creature in under thirty seconds.

Samid accepts that wager.

Gundren ignites the Thundercannon and lines up his shots.

The first detonates in the sand next to the beast and it writhes and coils in shock and terror.

The next two shots blow carapace and legs apart.

A heavy bolt soars in from Patches and she quickly reloads.

The beast dives into the rock and sand, chewing through the stone in an attempt to get away.

It reappears fifty feet later, and then begins to dive into the sand again.

Three more blasts hit it in the back, and another Bolt.

It’s backhalf stops moving and it flops weirdly and the two snipers finish it, blasting chitin, mandibles and legs apart from the segmented horror.

Samid hands over his flask, a little shocked.

The group heads down to the Monolith.

It is hard to get the lay of the land in the darkness of night, so the group takes refuge in Fey’s magnificent manor.

Samid loves the buffet.

Tark spends the night in the desert, enjoying the natural beauty.

Fey spends the evening in study and has a breakthrough with weight manipulation magic.

The next morning, the group awakes and begins to investigate the area for the Chardalyn.

They determine that the obelisk offerings were wrecked a few days ago, not by the worm.

Large footprints lead north, to the Sinkhole “mine”.

Getting to the Sinhole, it has been intentionally collapsed.

They find giant tracks and wagon tracks leading further north and identical tracks from the east.

Hopping into the sinkhole, Doc and Patches both try to get down, moving earth aside and blasting it with satchel charges.

Digging down a good thirty feet, Patches pulls a twisted corpse from the stone.

A pulverized Goblin and a Duergar made mining pick.

The group windwalks to the north, following the tracks until hours later, in the distance the group sees a large Mesa with ruins nestled at the foot.

Birdlike harpies wheel overhead, screeching and down in the ruins, behind another massive Menhir and guarding a well made tunnel into the Mesa - a Massive giant sits.

The massive creature sits around a cooking fire, chopping harpies into a bubbling stew and tossing the viscera to two large creatures - a pony-sized Hellhound and a strange catlike creature with an eyeball on the tip of its tail the size of its head.

The giant is unlike any the group have seen recently, though several recognize the telltale characteristics of a Mountain Giant.

Born one in a thousand, Mountain Giants are Savants of the Hill Giant subrace.

Born far more intelligent than their brothers and sisters, Mountain Giants frequently flee the simple culture of their kin for more cultured lives.

Far from good though, Mountain Giants frequently become warlords or tyrants over the smaller races.

Cirrus wants to chat with him.

The group takes up defensive positions around the area, keeping an eye on the Harpies overhead.

The sun begins to get low on the horizon.

Cirrus walks from the deepening shadow, Disguised under an illusion of a bedine traveler.

The guard-beasts instantly come on alert and the giant stands, his splint armor clanking and light catching on a diamond in the center of his bronze helm.

The behemoth palms a cannonball from a bag and deftly puts it spinning in a sling, loosing it a second later with a gunshot-like crack of air.

The cannonball hits the ground 10ft in front of Cirrus and sprays him with a shower of gravel and dirt from the impact.

Cirrus calls out for sanctuary.

The giant loads his sling again, about to watch a “human” explode.

But he hesitates, peering at the approaching “human”.

He recognizes an illusion and the giant stands a little straighter.

In rumbling common, the giant demands he drop the illusion.

Cirrus knows the gig is up and complies and introduces himself as Baron Sirrus Al-Kayan of Selunia.

The giant is a little shocked at the white robed, metal-eyed horned tiefling standing in front of him, unperturbed from his slingshot.

The giant introduces himself as Bolg.

Cirrus asks to join him at his fire and the Giant cautiously accepts, glancing into the ruins, looking for who this strange creature came with.  He sees no one.

Cirrus takes the next hour or so to persuade and butter up Bolg, giving him mayonnaise and even engaging in a contest of strength.

After the tomb of Levisticus melts and the cannonball thuds into the ground, the Giant relents, and welcomes the Warlock and his allies to the camp.

Meanwhile, Samid, Doc, Tark, Thorns and Snorbul all head due east, following another trail, intending to circle back in a few hours.

The remaining crew all head in from the dark and the Giant nods, he had a feeling the Warlock was not alone.

He glowers at the tiny elf though.  Patches gestures to her weapons and says “I stab stuff” Bolg cocks an eyebrow.

Negotiations continue and information is passed between the two groups.

The group asks if he knows the Fire Giant Surtr.

Bolg says he does not, but as a Fire Giant, Surtr is definitely higher in the Odrening than himself.

Hearing about Surtr, Bolg is intrigued and more open to the idea of working for the group.

For twenty thousand gold, and the deaths of his Duergar employers currently in the mines behind him, Bolg will head to the Barony and work as a mercenary.

The group agrees.

They head into the mine.


The main entry chamber has sustained a lot of damage over the years and is confirmed to be ancient Netherese from the architecture.

Gundren spots the telltale sign of new stonework though and after a quick inspection, finds that the entire entrance ceiling is rigged to drop from a lever pull.

No doubt Bolg was to drop the entrance.

Heading past, they see a ramp down that is filled with collapsed rubble, an elevator shaft with no elevator and then a second elevator shaft with a newly built Duergar construct.

Patches quickly descends the shaft with no elevator and gets to the bottom - it is filled with collapsed stone.

She returns to the group and they decide to bite the bullet and take the Duergar elevator.

They prepare for a fight.

What they get is a massacre.

As the elevator descends, they spot a barricade of Duergar soldiers, including a large cannon.

Fey unleashes a sleep spell, Patches throws her sleep bomb and cirrus releases a hypnotic pattern.

Only two of the guards don’t immediately go down and are beset by Gundren, Gwen and Patches.

The battle is short but fierce and although the Duergar get in a few good swings, they fall quickly - one in fact being pushed off a small cliff.

Cirrus feeds the remaining unconscious Duergar to his bag of devouring.

The group looks around, tense at the thought of the sounds of battle carrying.

The cavern is huge and stairsteps its way down into darkness.

The ceiling is about 45ft overhead and slopes at a 30 degree angle.

Two large carved pillars support the ceiling and the telltale signs of man-made stonework litters the area.

The ground is thick with dust and the truly ancient tools that remain are covered in cobwebs.

They may not have been disturbed for millenia.

The cavern rings with the sounds of mining and hammering.  It is noisy with Duergar industry.

Up ahead, the group spots a nest of Darkmantles on the ceiling and slip around them.

Fey triggers a tripwire and a bomb goes off, spraying the area with metal shards and a strange cloying liquid.

Where the liquid hits, it begins to turn to stone.

Luckily they manage to shed the Basilisk venom before it could really begin the process.

Cirrus pulls a key off of one of the dead Duergar.

Further down in the cavern, movement catches the groups attention.

A trio of Duergar move out from a large set of doorways, directly up to a shining deposit of Grey crystal - Chardalyn, though oxidized.

The lead Duergar, wearing black leathers and a metal cap, thrusts a hand forwards and around the top of the pillar a flaming sphere roils into existence.

The spell goes off amongst a nest of Stirges and many of the things ignite and fall dead to the ground.

The group rushes in as the spellcaster is distracted.

Patches throws a Tar bomb and Cirrus blasts the spellcaster off the small cliff.

As he falls, he shapeshifts into a Cave bear, and scrambles right back in to attack.

Gundren blasts away, as does Fey.

Patches engages both Duergar warriors in melee.

From behind though, Fey and Cirrus are scooped up by rock-like tentacles.

A Roper has snuck up from behind and it quickly reels them in.

Fey reaches into its mind and unleashes a Phantasmal horror and the thing drops him in shock.

Cirrus blasts at the thing with Eldritch power but it gets a good bite into him.

Worse, the Darkmantle nest drops onto the Warlock and begins to crush at him.

The shapeshifter is shot dead and Patches finishes off the Duergar.

They turn and assist their spellcasting colleagues and with the four now focusing their efforts, they make quick work of the Roper and Darkmantles.

Bloodied and breathing heavily, the sounds of many more Duergar echoes about the caverns of this ancient Netherese Chardalyn mine.
