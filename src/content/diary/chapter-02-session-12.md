The group is camped down in the catacomb, resting after the hard fought battle.  After several hours, Doc B. and JmJm come out of the ToD to the strange sight of the marble tomb. JmJm hear the escapades from the group and share short greetings with the new Elf and Dwarf in the group.   Deciding that they had rested long enough, and not finding much of use in the tomb, the group steps through the next portal.

   They find themselves in a wheat field, seemingly endless and in a perpetual dusk.  Up ahead, the group can see the next archway.  Suspecting something not right, Patches begins to flank the group, using the long grass Wheat as a visual blocker.

The group enters into a clearing, in front of the archway sits a massive Androsphinx.  The beast sits back on it's haunches, the humanoid face scrutinizing the group.   The group is told to answer several moral quandries to pass.  They answer the first incorrectly and are subject to the Roar of the Androsphinx, being terrified.  The answer the next two correctly however and the portal shines to life behind the beast.  As it dissolves into motes of light, it roars, summoning a heroes feast of which the group partakes.  The group steps through the last portal.

   They discover themselves in a massive cavern, spherical in nature with a massive solid gold Obelisk from floor to ceiling, a dozen feet thick.   Looking behind them, the group can see several archways, a rough hewn tunnel and the caverns they got to the vault through.  The group realizes they have not traveled very far in the real world, reinforced by Kangaxx jogging up to the group from down the tunnel.   He rests his hands on his knees, huffing and puffing but staring at the Obelisk.   The group starts to tell him what he missed but Kangaxx ignores, it smiling and says "So kind of you fools to bring me so far…"

  In an explosion of black smoke and orange lightning, the group is thrown to the ground and Kangaxx strides forth from the vortex, glowing flesh silhouetting his skeleton.  Cackling, he explains the group took him through the wards of this place, that he summoned the mists, and drove Venomfang to madness and undeath, that his master Orcus has been craving the artifact shards and will now have this one.  From the vortex steps two Glabrezu demons and a host of manes to attack the group.  Kangaxx begins an incantation on the obelisk and is immune from all damage.

The battle against the Glabrezu is intense.  Lightning bolts and fireballs fly.  Fey managing to subdue all the lesser demons in a flash of magical energy.  The Dwarf cleric was torn in half by the Glabrezu, Buumi was bloodied by the rending claws and Tark was even dropped from 60ft by the claws of a Glabrezu.  Arrow after arrow found their mark, fists of fury reigned down and the assassination and magic attacks managed to pound down the two great demons.

As the demons dissolved into smoke the group sees two more Glabrezu beginning to take form…

A flash of light and the golden pillar is no more, instead about 15ft in the air is a golden chit, maybe an inch in length, Kangaxx smiles and reaches for it…

A shrill whistled not splits the air and all the magic in the room is suddenly dispelled.  The portal to the abyss is gone, all the parties buffs and spell effects end, and Kangaxx's shield is no more.

Stepping from the air, Lo'Dan swings his massive sword directly into the faxe of Kangaxx and with a spray of blood and sparks, Kangaxx is tossed forty feet rolling and skipping along the stone ground.

Ten other drow warriors step from the stone, pulling swords and Lo'Dan turns to address the group.  "So kind of you to lure this beast into our trap, you played your roles marvelously Spellforged!" and he tosses the group the other thousand gold he owed them.  At that instant a scream rent the air and the "corpse" of Kangaxx leaps into the air and emits a massive pulse of light, blinding all in the cavern (dex save).  As the glow subsides everyone can see a solid gold skeleton hovering where kangaxx was, magical energy and light cascading from it's form.  Precious gems and jewels cover Kangaxx, making intricate magical symbols and glowing with inner light.  Kangaxx, the Golden Skeleton and Son of Orcus raises his golden hand to strike down the group…
