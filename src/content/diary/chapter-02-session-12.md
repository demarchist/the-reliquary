The group rested in the tomb for several hours. Doctor Breakfast and JmJm emerged from the Tavern of Doors to the strange sight of the ornate marble chamber, and JmJm listened eagerly as the group recounted their escapades. They exchanged short greetings with the elf and dwarf who had joined the party in the forest. Deciding they had rested long enough and finding nothing else of use in the tomb, the group stepped through the next portal.

## The Androsphinx

They found themselves in a wheat field — seemingly endless, bathed in perpetual dusk. The next archway was visible ahead. Patches, suspecting trouble, broke off to flank the group through the tall wheat.

In a clearing before the archway sat a massive Androsphinx, its humanoid face scrutinizing the group as they approached. The beast posed a series of moral quandaries they had to answer to pass. They answered the first incorrectly and the Sphinx unleashed its roar — a wave of primal terror that shook them to the bone. They answered the next two correctly, however, and the portal blazed to life. As the Androsphinx dissolved into motes of golden light, it let out a final roar that summoned a heroes' feast. The group ate gratefully before stepping through the last portal.

## The Golden Obelisk

They emerged in a massive spherical cavern dominated by a solid gold obelisk stretching from floor to ceiling, a dozen feet thick. Looking behind them, the group could see several archways, a rough-hewn tunnel, and the caverns they'd originally entered through. They realized they hadn't traveled far in the real world at all — confirmed when Kangaxx came jogging up from the tunnel, huffing and puffing.

He rested his hands on his knees, staring at the obelisk. The group started to fill him in on what he'd missed. Kangaxx ignored them. He smiled.

"So kind of you fools to bring me so far..."

## The Betrayal

An explosion of black smoke and orange lightning hurled the group to the ground. Kangaxx strode forth from the vortex, his flesh glowing to silhouette the skeleton beneath. Cackling, he explained everything — the group had carried him through the vault's wards. He had summoned the necromantic mists. He had driven Venomfang to madness and undeath. His master Orcus craved the artifact shards, and now this one would be his. Two Glabrezu demons and a host of manes stepped from the vortex to attack the group. Kangaxx began an incantation on the obelisk and became immune to all damage.

The battle against the Glabrezu was intense. Lightning bolts and fireballs flew across the cavern. Fëanon subdued the lesser demons in a flash of magical energy. The dwarf cleric was torn in half by a Glabrezu's rending claws. Buumi was bloodied badly, and Tark was seized and dropped sixty feet by the claws of the second demon. Lothli's arrows found their marks, Tark's fists rained down with fury, and Patches' assassinations and the group's combined magic finally pounded the two great demons into dissolving smoke.

As the demons faded, two more Glabrezu began to take form from the vortex. Above, a flash of light consumed the golden obelisk — in its place, hovering fifteen feet in the air, was a golden chit no larger than an inch. Kangaxx smiled and reached for it.

## Lo'Dan's Ambush

A shrill whistle split the air and every scrap of magic in the room was dispelled at once. The abyssal portal collapsed. The party's buffs and spell effects ended. Kangaxx's shield was no more.

Stepping from thin air, Lo'Dan swung his massive sword directly into Kangaxx's face. With a spray of blood and sparks, Kangaxx was hurled forty feet, rolling and skipping along the stone floor. Ten Drow warriors materialized from the walls, drawing swords.

Lo'Dan turned to the group. "So kind of you to lure this beast into our trap. You played your roles marvelously, Spellforged!" He tossed them the remaining thousand gold he owed.

At that instant a scream rent the air. The "corpse" of Kangaxx leaped upward and emitted a massive pulse of light, blinding everyone in the cavern. As the glow subsided, the group saw what Kangaxx truly was — a solid gold skeleton hovering where the halfling had been, magical energy and light cascading from its form. Precious gems and jewels covered every bone, forming intricate magical symbols that glowed with inner fire.

Kangaxx, the Golden Skeleton, Son of Orcus, raised his golden hand to strike.
