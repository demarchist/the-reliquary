The group quickly catches up to the Caravan, traversing the badlands with haste

When they arrive, they find that the Caravan is indeed the missing sailors, Thirsty-Fingers and Liara

They are acting oddly though, making for the **Volcano of Mt. Saqar**

As the group investigates and inquires, they realize that Liara, Thirsty and half of the rest of the crew are psionically dominated

Feanon hears creatures speaking with Telepathy - the things say that they have been forced from their home in the Volcano, but that these humans will make for wonderful new slaves and food.

Feanon lets the group know they are not alone and then responds telepathically to the creatures.

Great insectoids burst from the ground and attempt to dominate the group, but the group is not caught unawares and immediately retaliate.

Feanon immediately unleashes a Disintegrate on the closest one, burning away many legs and chunks of flesh, but the thing survives the deadly blast.

Feanon warns the group that these things are tough!

The battle is fierce, the Insectoids proving to be formidable, but the group manages to cleanse the domination from several of the crew (Liara and Thirsty first) and they all join in battle against the beasts. 

Some of the crew are not so lucky, and are killed in the struggle.

Near the tail end of the battle,** Djoser and his Medja**i catch up to the group riding their mounts and assisting in the fight.

The great beasts are slain, with the last trying desperately to flee the fight, but is grabbed and gutted by Snorbul.

Djoser names these things as **Psi’Shara**


With the **Psi’Shara** (insectoids) killed, the group begins to rest up and take stock of the situation.

Djoser mentions that the largest piece of the **Spelljammer was lost to quicksand**, but that he intends to return to **Iyum** and get a proper expedition sent out to excavate it.

Liara says that she will return with Djoser and report to **Sultan Bashir**

The group wonders what to do next, with the civilians now rescued; they decide to send them back with Djoser and Liara to the city, 

but not before taking their coin from the recovered chests (but giving a fair amount to the civilians).

As the party talks, their attention turns to the nearby Volcano, spewing light and ash into the air.

Feanon thinks that perhaps the **Cult of the Black Skull** might be behind these creatures losing their home and coming out looking for food as the Cultists that tried to capture Doc and JmJm were heading back to the Volcano, 

he questions how the Cult could have gotten to the Spelljammer so quickly...

Djoser and Liara mention that the **Temple of Vaketh** lies on the slopes nearby, but none have returned from it in centuries.

Snorbul notes this and mentions that at the **Temple of Carthus**, he was told great power awaits him at the Temple of Vaketh.

They also mention that there is a **Legend; that a great Titanic Forge** exists somewhere in the Volcano.

Gundren perks up at this, wanting to find it and see what secrets it may hold.

They look for a good campsite, away from the remains of the battle and settle down for a long rest before the others take their leave and return to Iyum.

The group talks and they mull over their options

Buumi prays to Helm and Carthus, the embodiment of protection and justice in this world and he hears a quiet, but strong voice - **“Save the Dragon within the gorge, he will aid you in your path to order”**.

Buumi turns to his friends and tells them what he just heard - that Helm has given them guidance.

JmJm scoffs and he and Buumi launch into a theological discussion over the entities and gods of this realm and Faeurun.


Feanon turns to study his dark book away from the group.

He does not glean a new spell, but when he takes his Reverie, he has another waking vision.

He sees a dream of a magical college, clearly not Al’Askar but other than that, it is hard to place

He is in class going over familiar magical theory and grasps it easily, but the other students seem to shy away from him 

Eventually the headmaster comes in asking for “**Val Cerdno**”

When everyone turns to Feanon, he realizes he must be this Val and goes with the headmaster

Arriving at his office, the headmaster admonishes Val for burning a boy outside the College with Burning hands, blinding the lad in their confrontation

Feanon finds himself being forced to say that the lad deserved it and was weak

The headmaster’s face then begins to ooze corruption and melt, with ominous, echoing words coming forth, asking why Feanon puts up with the weak and powerless, saying that all should be subjugated by the strong, by the magical.

Feanon then wakes, and finds himself looking over the camp, but the landscape is twisted and blighted and covered with death

Great striding beasts of shadow can be seen across the landscape and a ghoul approaches

It calls to Feanon, asking if he is alright

He snaps out of the vision and sees Patches concerned face.

She asks why his eyes were solid black just now and that Feanon looks quite pale…
