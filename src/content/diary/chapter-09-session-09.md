Engulfed in mucus and restrained by the Aboleth’s minions, Feanon is held fast as the monster reaches forth with catfish like tendrils.

They caress his head and an enormous psychic might begins to crush Feanon’s will.

Theodemir yells at Fea as the Iron Tome attempts to shore up its wielders defenses but both are overwhelmed by the vastness of the Sovereignty.

Feanon begins to change, the mucous of the Aboleth infecting and changing him at a cellular level.

Something tears in the back of Feanon’s head and he feels a flow of warmth to the area, as if a tendon had torn.

Suddenly the psionic pressure lessens dramatically and the Aboleth recoils, letting loose a pulse of raw rage.

All those in the water are hurt by the psionic anger.

In the depths, the Kraken begins to swim back to the surface, electricity gathering along its skin.

The Storm giant begins to swim to the surface.

Gundren watches over the scene from high above, unaware of his friends plight in the depths of the lake.

The Storm buffets him atop his mount and he decides its time to put down, firing at enemies as Arkto comes in to land.

Patches continues to snipe with her crossbow, hitting the minions holding Feanon who manages to break free.

Thorna snaps out of her stupor as thunder rumbles overhead, she looks over the water and sees the group rushing about, fighting and calling for missing friends.

A great commotion catches her attention deep in the lake and with a gesture and word of power, Thorna shifts the water to drag Feanon and the Aboleth closer to the surface.

Tark rushes into the water to assist his friend and shadowsteps into combat with the Aboleth.

Snorbul, who had commandeered a boat, leaps into the water, swimming to rescue his taken friends with a length of rope securing him to the boat above.

Snorbul crashes into combat with the Aboleth, swinging his mighty axe.

The mucous of the beast splashes across the Deep Gnome however and he quickly finds his flesh changing color and becoming more translucent as he is changed by it.

The thing recoils under an onslaught of blows from the halfling and Deep Gnome, its mucous having no effect on the resilient monk but quickly changing the Gnome.

Patches slips into the water and gets a bead on the Aboleth, loosing a poisoned bolt, striking the Aboleth solidly.

Feanon and Tark are grabbed by the Aboleth and it begins to drag them into the depths, summoning an illusionary duplicate off in the distance which is promptly destroyed by Cirrus.

Thorna reaches forth again and drags at the Aboleth with Control Water, slowing its desperate flight.

They know its trick now as it summons more illusions and phantasms, but the Aboleth makes it deep into the lake, the roiling surface now nothing but a dark void overhead.

Feanon panics in the cold water as a great tentacled beast rises from the depths ahead, lightning arcing across its skin; The Kraken.

Feanon teleports himself and Tark out of the fight and to his teleport circle.


High above in the tower, the two figures appear in a flash of light in the Teleport chamber soaking wet and with mucous dripping off them, splattering on the ground.

Feanon rushes down the hall, holding his breath and feeling the air beginning to dry out his now amphibious skin.

He calls the elevator, praying that it is quick.

Luckily, it opens immediately and he rushes with Tark down to the laboratory, where a tank was awaiting the visiting Aboleth.

Feanon rushes into the lab, directly to the holding tank and just as his lungs begin to burn from holding, he and Tark open the hatch and the wizard splashes down into the tank.

Gulping in a lungful of water, the changed wizard takes a moment to collect himself.

He communicates telepathically out of the tank to Tark.

Opening his eyes, Tark has already left though, heading back to the teleport chamber to leap off to the battle still raging below….


Cirrus swims down, desperate to find his friends taken by the Aboleth.

Despite being mad at Feanon, Cirrus would hate to lose his friend.

He begins to Farstep deeper into the lake.

Gundren unloads onto the remaining minions he can see until a blinding blast of lightning steals his sight.

The Kraken, deep below has fired its lightning, into the Storm Giant who then redirected it against Buumi - the Paladin hovering above the lake attacking minions.

The column of lightning illuminates the valley for a moment and smashes into poor Buumi.

He screams in agony and almost falls from the sky, barely catching himself and quickly landing on the docks.

Deep below, Cirrus sees the Kraken charging another blast.

Gundren targets the giant and begins blasting.

Across the lake, Gundren notes flashes of fire along the shoreline; Surtr fighting?

Coral and flesh are destroyed and the mutated Storm Giant reels in pain, diving back under the water and retreating from the reach of the Thundercannon.

The Kraken fires.

The Giant redirects it at Snorbul.

As it boils the water, the lightning blast illuminates the very depths of the lake and slams into Snorbul.

The Gnome is blasted backwards and flops weirdly, unconscious.

He drops his axe and the magnificent blade falls to the nearby lakebottom.

Buumi heals himself with a prayer to Helm and flies over to the drifting boat Snorbul’s rope is still attached to and begins to haul in the unconscious Gnome.

Cirrus has had enough of the Kraken and Farsteps next to it.

He jabs the Iron Fork into the mottled hide of the creature and with a surge of power and tearing of reality, the Kraken is ripped into The Abyss.

The water collapses in on itself and with a flash of cavitation, becomes calm again.

Above, Thorna has called down an ice storm on the remaining minions, now engulfed in Tar (Patches) frozen into the lakes surface (Thorna) and getting systematically shot by Gundren.

They are killed quickly.

Deep below the Aboleth is lost in the dark waters and the Storm Giant is not far behind.

Before long, the Giant too has disappeared into the lightless waters.

Snorbul gasps back to consciousness from a healing touch from Buumi but then gags, having to drop back into the water to breathe.

The group looks around, the sounds of battle fading over the lake and the storm beginning to immediately lessen with the Kraken gone.

A serene night begins to form as the magically calm weather of the Barony reasserts itself.

The stars gleam and the waning moon reflects off of the numerous puddles.

Across the lake and out of the Darkness comes a boat, laden with figures; Dragonborn knights, soldiers, Doc B and JmJm.

The group then spots a fiery comet fly out of the forest shoreline of the lake and begin to arc out toward Feanons island.

As it nears to crashing, there is a fiery burst and Surtr appears in the air, catching the hammer and landing with a running stop.

Tark lands a moment later, having descended from assisting Feanon above.

The group gathers and they inquire about the Wizard as they all head into the tower, the guards and soldiers taking up defensive positions.

Doc heads over to Snorbul and heals him of his mutagenic disease and they catch up with the others, heading up to the lab to confront Feanon.


Cirrus makes it to the lab first, closing the door behind him and bracing it with a chair.

He approaches the tank and admonishes the wizard for his arrogance.

He realizes that the Aboleth was called before their chat in the Tavern but this is not a good look.  Citizens are dead and taken.

Patches and Snorbul rush forwards, intent on smashing the door down but Patches takes out the keycard, unlocking the lab and then Snorbul smashes into the door.

The chair bracing the door is shattered to splinters and Patches rushes toward the tank, Eclipse forming in her hand.

She slashes the tank and sparks fly.

Snorbul gets in on it too, smacking the Tank with his retrieved axe, showering the area with sparks but not damaging the tank.

Feanon shouts for calm and Patches responds with calls to violence against the wizard for his arrogance and reckless endangering of everyone.

Tempers cool quickly as Feanon uncharacteristically admits to wrong doing and apologizes and agrees to summoning a magistrate of Tyr and calling The Mind Hunters in to act as a check against Feanon.

Feanon stops the conversation, telling the group (after initially lying) that the Sovereignty is contacting him.

The Aboleths are impressed by the groups power but they have 8 hostages; citizens of the Barony.

They wish to trade these people for access to Feanon’s brain - they wish to send a surgeon to find out *how *the wizard resisted absorption by the Sovereignty.

Feanon refuses, but promises another solution.

The aboleths cut off communication and the group settles in for a long, paranoid and much needed rest.
