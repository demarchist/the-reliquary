A vicious blow knocked the Goblin King from his shoes — and the demiplane broke. A deafening boom shook the bog. In the sky above, a titan-sized outline in the shape of the Goblin King loomed over the horizon, moving toward the group and Goblin Town. Mist rose. Portals flickered open across the landscape as goblins fled through them. Everything was running.

## Collapse

Doctor Breakfast was swept away in a tidal wave of panicking goblins. The drider-goblins leaped out for one last attack, but the group ignored them and fled. Zhink was flung from Buumi’s shield to the top of a wall and leaped onto his chocobo. Buumi prayed to Helm for guidance and received a single command: *flee this realm. The plane is collapsing.*

Cyrrus looked up and saw a winged creature emerge from a portal — gaunt and hideous, its neck and body draped in necklaces of teeth. Mediocris Dente, the Tooth Fairy, his patron. Something snapped in Cyrrus. He went into a frenzy, crushing two goblins underfoot and hurling rocks at the creature. Buumi summoned Aurora and rode to his aid with Fëanon. Together they brought the Tooth Fairy down — Cyrrus, still in ape form, smashed its head flat with a giant amethyst. The pact was broken. Cyrrus was free.

JmJm reached the Goblin King’s magical slippers and pulled them on. Whatever relief they granted, he did not explain — he communicated something to Fëanon and fled toward Goblin Town.

## Escape

The group scooped up their wormed companions and a small goblin worm named Glenn, and ran. The titan of the Goblin King obliterated everything behind them. In Goblin Town, a massive staircase climbed straight into the sky toward an open door. The group sprinted up the steps as the Goblin King destroyed them from below.

They burst through the door into Foxy Crazy’s tower, stairs leading up to the Tavern of Doors. Their mounts and allies from the Bog were already there — fading, turning insubstantial as they recovered from prolonged exposure to the collapsing demiplane. Three chests had been saved: a dancing hammer that Buumi claimed, ioun stones distributed among the group, bracers of defence for Cyrrus, and several hundred gold.

Exhausted beyond measure, the group collapsed into their beds. Gundren was dumped unceremoniously in JmJm’s room. Tark was laid in the bunk he shared with Buumi. They slept for eight hours straight.

## The Last Word

The group woke to find Patches and Archmage Amaram waiting in the common room. Patches had returned from investigating the Duergar who had impersonated Lord Faendral — the portal chamber beneath the estate was part of a larger network, and the Duergar band was a raiding force intercepting supply convoys between Menzoberranzan and Gracksulth. With the Bog expedition concluded, Patches dismissed Zhink, who cheerfully headed back to Lady Faye.

Amaram had grim news. The golden artifact Kangaxx had sought from the celestial vault beneath Neverwinter was a fragment of something called The Last Word — one of five shards scattered across the multiverse. He could not say what it did or how to use it. He knew only that Orcus was responsible for its sundering, and that if the shards were reunited, the resulting power would be beyond comprehension.

The group barely had time to process this before Amaram reacted to a telepathic message. Something was happening outside. He told them to meet him at the mage tower and departed immediately.

## The Siege Begins

The group emerged through the tailor’s shop — bullying him one last time for good measure; the tailor locked himself in his room — and stepped into the streets. The sun was setting. A full moon rose. The temperature plummeted and thick fog rolled in, flowing visibly downhill toward the docks. Patrols of mercenaries and paladins marched past in heavy numbers. Civilians barricaded their doors. Rats and vermin fled uphill.

A paladin named Sir Teft called out to the group, asking if they knew what was happening. They did not. Patches used her spider web gauntlet to zip up to a nearby rooftop. From above, she watched the mist pour into the docks like water draining into a basin. The harbour water began to churn and boil.
