The group is battling Goblins in the bog, and the Goblin king suddenly leaps from his shoes after a vicious hit against him. Suddenly a massive boom and the whole bog begins to shake. Looking into the sky, a massive outline in the form of the Goblin king looms over the bog - and it's moving towards the group and Goblin town.  Doc B. is carried off in a tidal wave of Goblins as a mist rises.  As the group looks around, portals begin to open, fleeing goblins heading towards Goblin town.  In fact, everything seems to be fleeing in the direction of Goblin town.

The drider goblins leap out and attack the group, but the group either ignores them, fleeing from the area - Zhink leaping atop his Chocobo after being flung from Buumi's shield to the top of a wall.  Doc is seen, far off actually being saved by the Goblins.  Buumi prays to Helm for guidance and is told to flee this realm - the Plane is collapsing.

Cyrrus looks up and sees a winged and creepy Fae leave a portal, it's neck and body covered in tooth necklaces.  Cyrrus goes into a rage and leaps after it, crushing two goblins in the process and flinging great rocks at The Tooth Fairy.  Seeing his companion in trouble, Buumi summons Aurora and rides to his aid, with Fae on the mount too.

JmJm reaches the Goblin Kings Slippers and dons them.  He appears relieved and communicates something to Fae before fleeing in the direction of Zhink and Goblin Town.

Buumi assists in slaying the tooth Fairy, with the final hit from Cyrrus as a great ape, smashing it's head flat with a giant amythyst.  Free of his vile patron, Cyrrus, Buumi and Fae scoop up the wormed companions and a small goblin worm named Glenn.  The whole group flees towards Goblin town with the titan of The Goblin King close behind.

Arriving in town, they see a massive staircase, straight into the sky and towards an open door.  The group books it up the staircase, with the Goblin King destroying it just behind them.

Reaching the door and passing through it, the group finds themselves in Foxxy Crazy's tower home, stairs leading up and back to the Tavern of Doors.  In front of them, their mounts and companions from the bog that fled here, begin to fade, turning insubstantial while they recover from being exposed to that demi plane for so long.

In front of the group are three chests, saved from the demi-plane.  The group finds a +2 Dancing Hammer that Buumi takes, a Iuon stone of spell storing, intelligence, nature, medicine and acrobatics and several hundred gold.  Cyrrus also gets bracers of defense +2.

Buumi takes the hammer, Fae the Int stone, Cyrrus the spell storing stone, Buumi then medicine stone, patches the acrobatics stone.  These float above the head, orbiting or staying in place.

Exhausted, the group heads up the stairs to some much needed sleep.  Gundren is unceremoniously dumped in JmJm's room, even as JmJm lies naked, asleep on his own bed.  Tark is laid to bed in the room he shares with Buumi and buumi falls into his own bed.  The group sleeps for eight hours.

Upon waking and heading down to the common room, the group finds themselves face to face with Patches and Archmage Amaram of Baldur's Gate.  Patches explains that she has returned from investigating the Duergar that was posing as Lord Faendrall and discovered that the chamber the group found with the portal is just a smaller part of a larger network and that the Duergar band they faced was a part of a larger force raiding supply convoys between Menzoberranzan and Gracksluth.  Zhink is then dismissed by Patches and Zhink cheerfully heads back to Lady Faye. Patches says hi to the group and re-introduces Amaram - she fetched him after she couldn’t find the group in the Tavern.  Amaram scried the goings on deeper in the box and they simply waited for the group to return for a few hours.

Amaram tells the group what he could find out about the golden artifact that Kangaxx wanted from the mystical vault beneath Neverwinter - It is a fragment of the power of the cration called The Last Word.  It is one of 5 shards, scattered through the multiverse.  He knows it's powerful, but not how, or how to use it.  All he knows is that Orcus was the reason it was split asunder and that if it were to be re-united, it would be powerful beyond belief.

The group thinks about this and chat for a moment while Amaram reacts to a telepathic message.  He asks the group to meet him at his guild hall (city magetower) quickly, something bad is happening outside and he leaves to gather more information.

The group heads topside, into the shop of the tailor they had been griefing since they got to Baldurs Gate.  They bully the tailor a little and the tailor locks himself in his room so he doesn’t need to deal with them.  The group takes a bolt of silk for their troubles and heads out into the streets. 

The streets are getting misty as the sun sets and a full moon rises.  The temperature drops rapidly and the fog visibly thickens. Patrols of mercenaries and paladins march by, you notice a large troop increase and civilians battoning down the hatches - everyone knows something is about to happen, something big.

A nearby paladin calls to the group - Sir Teft and asks them if they know what's happening, they don't.  At this point, the group notices that the mist is flowing down hill, towards and into the water of the Docks.  Rats and other Vermin are fleeing in the opposite direction.  Using the spider web gauntlet, Patches zips up to a nearby rooftop for a better view.  As she watches on and relays what she sees to the group below - the water of the docks begins to churn and boil, the mist flowing into it faster and faster, like a liquid draining away…
