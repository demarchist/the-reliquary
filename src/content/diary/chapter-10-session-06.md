Feanon has been so distracted with his personal project that he has not had time to go downstairs and meet with the servant from Vizeron.

That personal project is checking on his clone.

Indeed, in his laboratory, Feanon goes through the last checklist and preparations to finish the clone.

Examining the body in the amniotic fluid tank, he goes over the final checklist, noting only a minor divergence in the appearance of the body, a minor cleft palette and easily fixed.

More important than the physical body though, are its Philotic connections to the Weave and Psionics.

Both are strong, the Clone has come out in excellent condition.

Feanon contacts Theodemir in the ring and wakes the spirit, letting him know that the time is nigh, the body is ready.

Feanon creates a link between the ring of Mind Shielding and the Clone body, a feat only possible through Fea’s burgeoning Psionics, and creates a link through which Theodemir’s soul can flow.

As the clone’s eyes twitch and the Soul Conduit ends, Feanon pulls the release lever to drain the tank and jettison the Clone onto the waiting padded area.

The clone flops weirdly to the mat and Feanon throws a soft blanket over the body and has one of the Unseen Servants carry him to a nearby chair.

Fea summons a small light and checks the Pupil response which looks good.

Over the next few minutes, Theodemir begins to exert control over the Clone body of Feanon, claiming it as his own.

Fea notes that Theo is getting stronger and better at controlling the body even in the short time he has had it.

He assigns an Unseen Servant to see to Theo and then heads from the lab, meeting the group in the lobby of his tower.


Meanwhile, the group has assembled in the lobby of Feanon’s tower in anticipation of being taken to dine with Vizeron DeVir.

Feanon arrives but before they can leave, Patches takes the wizard aside.

Clearly stressed about the entire situation in the Underdark, she warns Feanon about Vizeron; that whatever he thinks he knows about the Drow Wizard, it is only the tip of a very dangerous iceberg.

Feanon chuckles, saying he knows and that he is prepared.

Patches responds that if he thinks he’s prepared, he’s not as wise as he thinks.  To which Feanon nods, accepting a small modicum of humility.

The group approaches the spot where Kleve the Death Sladd has been patiently waiting, the strange creature becomes visible at their request and extends it’s human-form hands.

As the hands are raised, the fingers begin to elongate weirdly, regaining some of their natural proportions as Kleve tells the group that they need to physically touch the Slaad to be Planeshifted.

The party reluctantly agrees and all make physical contact with the Slaad.

With a flash of light and thunderclap of displaced air, the party is transported.


The group blinks at the change in scenery and despite being warned of traveling to the Astral Plane, find themselves in a surprising location; a dark stone reception chamber.

Green light filters through stained glass windows in a sharp and tall Gothic style that many in the group instantly recognize as Drow architecture, except missing all of the typical spider-themed embellishments.

Kleve, in it’s true form, lopes forwards, its elongated arms extending to push open the set of double doors.

Looking around, the group sees that the reception room is clearly for teleporting guests as there are no other ways in.

The double doors open in front of them and they are greeted by the sight of a dining hall.

At the head of a long dark table, sits Vizeron in emerald Green robes, though he stands and greets the group graciously, inviting them to sit with him.

As they enter though, Vizeron does directly address Patches, asking her about her views on Lolth.

Patches responds that she’s not a fan and Vizeron smiles approvingly.

He asks her about her Piwafwi, asking if she is a member of House **Xorlarrin**, fourth house of Menzoberranzan and known for their Wizards.

He asks her if she knows **Ravel Xorlarrin** and Patches says that she does not.

The group obliges and are quickly served, Vizeron clapping and having a half dozen Unseen Servants begin to serve drinks and food.

Another clap and the dining table populates with main courses - many dishes being rather exotic; such as Illithid tentacle Calamari and Giant Spider Legs.

The party digs in, sufficiently impressed (and Feanon recognizing this pocket plane as a Magnificent Mansion spell)

After exchanging pleasantries, Vizeron gets down to business.

He mentions that the threat of the Demon Lords in the Underdark unchecked is a disaster.  For the sake of everyone, the Demon Lords must be banished.

He goes on to explain that **Gromph Baenre, Archwizard of Menzoberranzan** was the one responsible for summoning the Demon Lords from the Abyss, the first of which was Demogorgon which appeared in the middle of the Drow Capital.

The Demon Lord was driven away though it dealt a great deal of damage to the surprised city.

Gromph is now nowhere to be found, though it appears very very few people know of the Baenre’s involvement in the summoning.

Vizeron offers a solution to the Demon Lord issue, though he needs the groups help.

He was in Gravenhollow finishing up a ritual spell designed to draw all the Demon Lords together, whip them into a frenzy, and have them battle to the death.

Tark thinks that’s a great idea, but mentions that they would keep regenerating.

Vizeron nods and says that the first couple of deaths, sure, the Demon Lords would consume the ambient magic and re-form their physical bodies, but the magic would quickly be used up, resulting in true banishment after a while.

Then, the group would be in a position to swoop in and kill whichever of the Demon Lords remains standing, finally banishing all of the Demon Lords back to the Abyss.

The group likes this plan.

Vizeron smiles and offers to take them to his lab for the rest of the information.

The group heads from the Magnificent mansion, out into the real Underdark and into Vizeron’s Tower.

They find themselves on the first floor with four doors: Three going to Magnificent Mansions and one going out into the Underdark. Feanon is suitably impressed that the tower holds not one, but three pocket planes.  Vizeron remarks that he has several in case he has guests that do not get along.

The group hops into the center of the tower, using the Levitation dweomer to ascend the tower.

On the fifth level, Vizeron leads them through a set of doors and into his lab.

The modest chamber has a large work table, a bubbling tank in the back of the room (with nothing in it) and three mortuary slabs, each with a shrouded body laying on it.

The lab table is veritably covered in notes and arcane apparati.

Gundren, figuring that the Wizards have it covered, heads back to the levitation shaft of the tower and begins to play with it, leaping into it and catching himself just before hitting the floor.

Inside the Lab, Vizeron lays out what he needs to finish the spell to rid the Underdark of the Demonic presence:

He has a Purple Worm Egg, Beholder Eye and Trillimac Mushrooms.

He needs: 

6 angel feathers from 6 different angels.

The heart of a Goristro Demon

The blood or ichor of a Demon Lord

Gromph’s Grimoire

He mentions that all save the Grimoire can be found in the Labyrinth, a large section of the Underdark to the South West of the Darklake and a few days travel from Gracksuluth.

He also mentions that Gromph’s Grimoire is not *required* but would help significantly if he could see the spell that first summoned the Demon Lords.

Lastly, he mentions that  casting the spell to rid the Underdark fo the Demons needs to be cast close to the location of the original spell; The Clawrift in Menzoberranzan.


The group needs time to talk this over and they take their leave, returning to Feanon’s tower in the Barony and thanking Vizeron for dinner.

The Drow wizard is amicable, even giving the group a chest containing several Drow Piwafwi cloaks as a show of good faith and then lets them leave, stating that he hopes they will join him in his quest to save the Underdark.

Back in the Barony and atop Feanon’s tower, the group begins to talk over everything they have learned.

No one trusts Vizeron

Feanon goes on to say that there’s more to the spell than he could get at first glance, he wants to try and get another look at it if he can.

The other thing that Vizeron was clearly lying about is that the spell does NOT need to be done in Menzoberranzan.

Patches however, has an idea.

If they summon the Demon Lords to the **Qu’Ellarz’Orl, the noble Plateau and specifically Kyorbblivvin, the Mushroom forest **there, it would be a fantastic distraction while keeping the majority of Menzoberranzan’s population out of the Line of Fire.

She elaborates that summoning the Demon Lords there would let them mount a rescue of Finn in House Faen Tlabbar and allow the Noble Houses of Menzoberranzan to then rally and mop up the Demon Lord battle Royale.

The group thinks that a great plan and they finally commit; they will save Finn by using the Demon Lords as a distraction.

As the group discusses their order of operations; should they mount an assault on Thanatos and THEN banish the Demon Lords?  They decide that survival in Thanatos would be beyond them at this point and although Orcus is not currently in his Throne City, it is too well defended for just the group to try and infiltrate.

Whatever Lolth is doing in The Abyss, it is currently beyond the group to interfere effectively.

They decide to focus on another piece of the Last Word; the piece connected to the Labyrinth and the Ancient Ruins there as well as working on ridding the Underdark of the Demon Lords, multiple birds and stones etc.

As the group goes to disperse though, a voice calls out from the darkness of the night sky, a melodic elven voice that they recognize;** Lo’Dan**.

The Drow floats in on a flight enchantment and lands atop Feanons tower (after receiving permission).

Lo’Dan looks worse for wear, covered in some mean looking burns and limping badly.

The group decides that they should talk with him over some drinks and they head out to Over the Moon with the agent of Bregan D'Aerthe.

There, they question Lo’Dan and find that the Drow was most recently in **Mantol Dertih **and battled Corpsetaker and Li Xian.

By a stroke of luck, Lo was thrown from the outpost, high above the Darklake, by a fireball (hence the burns).  He fell far below, to the waters of the Darklake, which saved his life.

Thrown clear of a magical malaise that had gripped Mantol Derith, Lo’Dan was able to survive the fall and call for a pick up.  The rest of his team died in Mantol Derith, along with all the inhabitants, to Corpsetaker and it’s team of monsters.

Lo’Dan is pretty happy when he hears that the group avenged his men by killing Li Xian and the Beholder.

Patches mentions that she plans on mounting a rescue of Finn and Lo’Dan perks up at this.  She asks him for help and the Drow agent shifts uncomfortably.

He says he wants to help, but such an act, within the Capital of the Drow no less, requires the go ahead from the big boss himself: **Jarlaxle.**

He mentions that **Jarlaxle **would want a meeting and that he will meet the group in the ruins of the old Do’Urden compound, on the northern wall of the city.

The group heads out to their abodes to prepare for their journey to The Labyrinth the next day.

Gundren stops by his manufactory, checking on the progress of the belt of Giant Strength he’s having his brothers make.  Everything is going well and the reagent orders have been sent to Sundabar.  They expect to have the thing crafted within the month.

Before retiring, Patches asks if Feanon has had any further luck with the etchings she took from the ancient Elven site in the Anauroch desert.

Feanon responds that he has; The etchings show that **Abraxim and Halashnar** were driven north, beyond the Spine of the World Mountains and into the fields of ice.


Cirrus heads to the Fane and into his private chambers.

He takes out the Well of Many Worlds and casts it against the nearby wall.

The portal opens to a wondrous sight; an underground lake fed by a roaring waterfall, the place teeming with plant and fungal growth and the stones veritable glittering with mineral deposits.

The whole place is dimly lit by a silvery light and gives off a welcoming aura.

Cirrus steps through and closes the portal behind him.

Cirrus begins to wander.

Hours go by and the Warlock begins to grow exhausted, but still he persists, driven by the insatiable need to know what plane he is on.

Heading down a larger tunnel the Warlock stops as a voice calls out behind him, asking who he is and why he is ambling around.

A great beast looms from the shadows, though it asks with curiosity, not anger.

It introduces itself as **Kirangelos, an ancient Behir.**

The many legged beast manages to coax a precious pearl necklace out of the Warlock and in exchange, says that he is in the Plane of **Ysgard **and specifically; **Svartalfheim.**

Ecstatic, though hiding it well, Cirrus takes his leave, intent on finding some semblance of civilization when it becomes apparent that without further bribes that Kirangelos would not be forthcoming.

Cirrus continues walking, thinking about how close he is to **The Gates of the Moon** and his goddess.

After another hour, he finally hears laughter echoing down the tunnels.

He rounds a corner, spotting two Drow lounging along a subterranean river bank, drinking a bottle of silvery wine.

Just as he moves in to greet them, a sword comes to rest on his shoulder.

Cirrus raises his hands non-threateningly and another Drow reveals himself, though none of these drow look like the Lolth-Sworn Cirrus is familiar with.

Indeed, these Drow smile easily, and not in a predatory way, but with true warmth.

Their garb is mostly white and silver and they are covered in elegant Mithril jewelry.

Cirrus sits with them and they talk.

The Drow are followers of Elistraee and residents of Svartalfheim.  They hail from the Petitioner city of **Dokkar**; a three day walk north from here, though mounted on summoned steeds, the trip is much faster.

Their names are **Lirian, Kiran and Pemele**

They do not have the gold for Cirrus to make a Planar Fork but they offer to escort Cirrus - an obvious follower of Selune - to **Dokkar **where he can acquire one.

They head out from the subterranean river, summoning their mounts and heading toward the extra-planar Drow city devoted to Elistraee.

(Cue personal session with Cirrus in the Extra-planar city of Dokkar)


Back in the material world, the group gathers the next morning to head to The Labyrinth.

Cirrus does not show.

After waiting an hour, the group begins to worry and they head to the Fane, only to find the Warlock missing.

They investigate his rooms, finding nothing, though Feanon suspects that the Warlock opened a portal to the Higher Planes.

Confused and worried for their friend, the group waits and wracks their brains for what to do about their missing companion.
