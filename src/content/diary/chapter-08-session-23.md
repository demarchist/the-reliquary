The Party

The group won the battle in the fighting pits and head back into the ready-room.

As they leave the arena, several of them notice a hulking figure in a heavy black cloak watching them from the crowd and then leave...

Relaxing and recuperating in the readyroom, they discuss what to do next as the Duergar hand them their winnings.

While relaxing, a knock at the door alerts them and they check it out, seeing the Drow Wizard that just fought them.

**Dano Barrison Del Armgo** proposes a job for the group - Mercenary escorts for the noble entourage and their "purchases" back to Menzoberranzan.

He takes his leave, giving the group four days to think it over and 100gp a day as a retainer to be delivered to the Town House.

Cirrus, Snorbul and Gundren decide to celebrate with their winnings.

As they look over the massive amount of money, Fey rushes forward with the depositing wand and whisks it away.

Patches yells at Fey as they don't have a lot of cash on hand and she needed the platinum for a Bag of holding as she is currently holding The Artifact, which makes her very uncomfortable.

The group splits up, with Patches looking to gamble (to make money). Cirrus, Gundren and Snorbul to go on a bender with Tark as chaperone.  

Fey decides to go and talk to Themberchaud the dragon and sets off into the city.

Seeing Fey going off alone though, Patches decides to follow the Wizard at first.

Heading upstairs, the party group finds the "shady" part of The Shattered Spire and quickly peruse and order a number of different drugs.

Gundren is strapped down and takes some "Rage" while the others engage in Cirrus' habit of inhaled drugs.

Thinking it a fantastic idea to go to the fighting pits again, they begin to untie Gundren but are quickly discouraged by the Duergar around them.  Instead, Gundren is taken to the pits to be "released".

Cirrus, Snorbul and Tark head down to the main floor.

Thinking that they need patches, Snorbul rushes out the main door and begins across the bridge to the main city, stopping by several Drow and asking "Patches?".

Eventually he catches up to Fey and Patches, both talking on the bridge and watching the little Gnome's progress.

Patches heads back to assist Tark in chaperoning and Fey continues on alone, flagging down a rickshaw and heading deeper into the city.

Looking for something interesting, the group explores the establishment until they find what they are looking for, a "back room" for higher-stakes gambling.

Being let in by the guards due to their good showing and some effective persuasion, the group heads deeper into the establishment.

In the "back room" they find a huge chamber with numerous activities; fighting, card games, dice and a high-stakes Duergar trading game.

Settling in to watch, its apparent that the main game is too complicated for them to pick up in a single night, so they settle on betting instead.

Patches ends up searching for a game she can play, and cheat at and finds the card tables, noting the Drow Noble retinue from earlier relaxing in one corner of the room.

She avoids the other Drow and begins to play, cheating fabulously and getting some decent winnings.

The Orc

Fey meanwhile is heading toward Laduager's Furrow, moving through the Duergar section of the city.

Up ahead, a number of carts suffer from a collision and his rickshaw is diverted down an alleyway.

Noting this, Fey is immediately put on guard and un-surprised when the rickshaw puller is ripped away from the cart, causing it to tip and deposit the Wizard.

Fey rolls and quickly comes to his feet, ready.

He watches as two tentacles, covered in grasping tusks or fangs rip the rickshaw driver apart.

The massive cloaked figure from The Shattered Spire attacks, tentacles striking out from under the cloak to tear at Fey.

He raises a shield and extricates himself quickly, hasting himself and running as fast as he can back to the main thoroughfare

An ethereal creature pulls itself out of the wall as he passes and the Incubus attempts to Charm Fey.  The Incubus laughs and introduces the cloaked figure as **Ront**, the orc that they "abandoned" back in Sludubloop that escaped Velkynvelve with them.

The wizard stumbles but shakes the mental assault and continues running, making it back to the main avenue with no sign of pursuit.

Noting a large patrol of Devils, Fey points them down the alleyway to take care of a demonic incursion.

Fey rushes back toward the rest of the group, unwilling to risk travelling further by himself.

Back in the Shattered Spire, the group remembers that Gundren went to the fighting pits...alone. 

They head to the Pits in time to see Gundren crushing Goblins with his bare hands and getting absolutely covered in blood.

The Rage begins to fade after a few rounds and the exhausted Gundren rejoins his friends, their buzz beginning to wane.

Fey finds them down by the ready-room again, bloodied himself.

Now back together, they re-apply Gundren's makeup, Cirrus goes and vomits, and Fey begins to tell them what happened to him when trying to cross the city.

Discussing the attack, they remember Ront and figure that somehow it's related to Demogorgon.

The group decides that they will head back to their lodgings to rest, but Fey declines, saying he has to make his appointment in the Hall of Sacred Scrolls

Cirrus sends a tiny messenger to The Hall of Scrolls to postpone the meeting to translate the Iron Tome, but the response makes it clear that this would be the only time such an appointment could be kept.

Tired, the group decides to go together and wait while Fey has his appointment.

The Tome

They head through the city to The Hall of Sacred Scrolls and rent a small reading room, though Gundren and Tark peel off to go and work on Gwen at the Workshop.

The group takes a short rest while they wait and then Fey is taken to his appointment.

Entering a massive office and personal library of sorts, Fey sees a strange, yet familiar creature.

A fox-faced and fur covered Arcanaloth from the plane of Gehenna greets him, introducing itself as Lolanaroth, or **Lola**.

Fey takes out the Iron tome and then they begin to negotiate a price for the translation.

After some haggling, Fey trades information on Barovia and the new location of Castle Ravenloft and Lola begins to help.

Over the next hour, with their combined intellect and magic, they manage to decipher the tome.

Reading the first page of the Iron Tome, the red leather cover changes, eleven eyes opening on the cover and looking around.

The sentient magical artifact is a spellbook and begins to ask after its old master.

With its old master long dead, the link is non-existent and with an influx of power, Fey causes the book to bond with him, claiming The Iron Tome as his own.

He thanks Lola for her work and they part ways, Fey returning to the reading room where he collects the others and they head back to The Townhouse to get some proper rest.

The Alchemist

Back at the townhouse Tark is already there, sleeping on the couch,  the Cave-Bear cub asleep on his chest.

Doc greets the group and JmJm storms from his room right up to Fey and demands to return to the surface as he can no longer stand Gracksuluth and its dour mood.

Fey and Doc decide to try and find a tree for some other means of quick traversal but the idea loses some steam when they realize where they are, and that the Duergar city is exceedingly tree-less.

With no high level spells to get anyone top-side, the group rests and sleeps through to the next day, though are disturbed by nightmares.

Waking up early, Patches takes the lead to head to the **Muzgardt Brewery** and find her old contact **Claudine**.

Wanting to peruse the potions of the famous Muzgardt Clan, the group heads out with Patches to the Clan compound.

Arriving without incident, Cirrus provides a vocal distraction as a high-paying client to be shown the "goods", giving Patches the opening to slip away to find Claudine.

Perusing the Alchemy shops themselves, it doesn't take long to find the one with an older female human behind the counter.

The twenty years show heavily on her human features, but it is unmistakable, Patches recognizes her old friend.

Patches enters the shop and asks to peruse, Claudine not recognizing the Drow.

The old human lets out a wracking cough and pulls away a handkerchief with specs of blood on it.

As the old lady moves out to assist Patches in perusing the alchemical supplies and potions, a ruckus from the back of the store gets the Rogue's attention.

Looking back, she sees a half-drow girl exit the backroom carrying a large tray of healing potions to restock the shelves.  The girl calls to Claudine, "Ma, where do you want this batch?".

Claudine turns and motions to a shelf saying "Over there Zella"

Patches looks back to the human in front of her, pulling the Platinum mask from her face and Claudine hides her shock well.

Leaning in, Claudine asks "...Alyah?..."
