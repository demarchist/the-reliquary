## The Vampire Hunter

The finely dressed half-elf descended the stairs to the common room of the Bluewater Inn. He wore spectacles and a leather overcoat and carried a walking cane with an ebony handle — clearly old for a half-elf, looking more like a fit human in his sixties. He ignored the group entirely, made pleasant conversation with Urwen at the bar, collected his regular order and a large raw steak, and departed.

Patches tailed him. Via the group's communication devices she relayed what she saw: Rictavio headed to the stockyard, where the carnival cart turned out to be his. He opened a small slot and dropped the steak inside. Something large ate it with happy chuffing sounds. He sat and spoke to the beast for a while before heading back toward the inn. Patches investigated the cart and found a huge armoured sabretooth tiger inside, which sniffed at her with curiosity. She left and followed Rictavio, but the man had vanished.

Back at the inn, Fëanon positioned himself at the door to catch Rictavio's return — but hit the Wachter brothers instead as they walked in, knocking both unconscious with an accidental psychic blast. Urwen, furious, threatened to evict Fëanon if he could not control his powers. The chastened wizard retreated to the bar.

That evening, when Rictavio finally returned, Fëanon followed him to his private room and knocked. The half-elf was suspicious but allowed himself to be drawn into conversation. He revealed himself as Rudolph Van Richten, a human vampire hunter in magical disguise, in the valley to kill Strahd as his final hunt. When Fëanon attempted to charm him — a poor decision — the spell broke against a protective amulet. Van Richten drew his sword-cane and ordered Fëanon out at blade-point.

## The Dream

That night, the entire group shared the same dream.

They stood in a grey expanse of mist above an infinite plane of still water. Images flashed in the reflection: an old manor, once grand, now crumbling, with a dragon statue out front. A living silver dragon, luminous and majestic, the size of a small mountain. Ysera's golden scale, glowing in darkness. The kind, wise face of Moot — the old monk they knew.

A voice, quiet but insistent: *"Listen! You must LISTEN!"*

The mist resolved into two figures. One tall and straight, the other shorter and hunched, shuffling in what appeared to be a small room. Two voices — one regal and calm, the other withered and rasping:

*"I checked the perimeter. I found what was left of him."*

*"Kangaxx always was a fool. Why Orcus chose him as the third, I will never know."*

*"It matters little. The Shard is in Barovia — he fulfilled his purpose. I have mentioned it to Strahd, that it opens up… possibilities."*

*"The time is almost upon us! Atropos nears the material and we MUST be ready. What of this new group?"*

*"By all accounts they are formidable. They killed Morgantha and her daughters easily enough. It appears they cannot use the Shard, or they would have already left."*

*"No mortal can handle that power. Even for us it would be… traumatic." A pause. "You have prepared Strahd to leave Barovia?"*

*"I have, but there is an issue. The girl has been reborn, despite our… interference."*

*"Curse that stupid whore! She is not good enough for our boy! Fix it — kill her! There is not enough time for her soul to cycle back through."*

*"I do not believe he will leave, knowing that before long she will resurface again. We need a different solution."*

*"The elf girl? Patrina?"*

*"No, she is still trapped. However, this new group carries with them another artifact, one that may rid us of several problems."*

*"Intriguing. Go forth, execute your plans. But be careful, my love. We have not sunk fifteen centuries into this place, into our boy, only to be undone by a group of hapless adventurers — and not even the most powerful we have seen."*

*"Do not fret, my dear. As with all things, I will be subtle. And the Planeswalker Mordenkainen has been rendered… ineffectual. His items of power, scattered."*

The figures dispersed. The dream faded.

The group awoke and compared notes. Whoever these two were, they had expected Kangaxx and wanted the artifact he sought. They were manipulating Strahd and intended harm to Ireena. They considered the group a threat but had a plan. Mordenkainen was alive but neutralised. An elf had been mentioned, and the group worried they meant Fëanon or Patches. Recognising Argynvostholt from the dream, they resolved to go there — but first, the town demanded their attention.

## The Festival

The group had overslept. It was already mid-morning, and Urwen's wife informed them that everyone was in the town centre for the Festival of the Blazing Sun. They told Chekhov and Mr. Pickles to stay behind and rushed to the square.

A large crowd had gathered before the stage. Atop it stood a wicker effigy of a sun with empty shackles on its front, ready for a prisoner. Vargas was attempting to rouse the crowd in the damp rain. The group moved fast. Cyrrus ignited the effigy prematurely with a cantrip. Buumi pushed through the crowd toward the stage. Tark teleported directly beside Vargas, startling him. Fëanon prepared a charm spell. Cyrrus created an illusion of a pair of buttocks where the Burgomaster's face should be, complete with prestidigitated flatulence whenever the man spoke.

The crowd dissolved into giggles. Vargas, losing his audience, drew his rapier and threatened Tark. His personal guard closed in. Then a full laugh broke from the crowd and everything went silent. Vargas pulled out a hand mirror, saw the illusion, and dismissed it with his family signet ring. Furious and humiliated, he pointed at the man who had laughed — Boris, the guard captain — and ordered him dragged onto the stage.

Fëanon released his charm. Vargas became suddenly amicable toward the group, but even charmed he insisted on executing Boris. Patches, meanwhile, had been moving through the crowd handing out pamphlets extolling Ireena's virtues and painted an enormous portrait of the woman on the side of a house facing the square. Buumi grabbed Boris away from the guards with raw strength. The charm faded. Vargas saw the group arrayed against him, the crowd turning hostile, Ireena's painted face gazing down at him, and retreated to his manor with his guards.

## The Fall of Vargas

The group followed. Two guards at the manor doors took one look at Cyrrus — who had transformed himself into the image of a fiery demon — Buumi radiating holy light, and Fëanon whispering doubt into their minds, and fled. The group smashed down the front door.

Patches went around back and scaled to the second floor, entering through the bathroom where she found the Baroness Lydia. She talked the woman into fleeing and lowered her safely to the ground with her spider bracers. Then she circled to the library hallway and set a satchel charge and two traps.

The group came up the main stairs. Tark sprinted ahead and drew two musket shots — one going wide, one deflected by the monk's ki-infused hands. Cyrrus rounded the corner in his fiery disguise while Fëanon unleashed a hypnotic blast that dropped every guard but one. Tark and Cyrrus dispatched the last the old-fashioned way.

Vargas had barricaded himself in the library with twelve loaded flintlocks. Cyrrus blasted through the wall with eldritch energy. Buumi kicked in the door. Patches detonated the satchel charge behind the Baron. The triple breach sent Vargas and his arsenal flying. He managed one shot into Buumi before a spell paralysed him from the neck down. Patches stepped up behind the helpless man and drove her blade into his back, preparing to finish it — but the group called her off, satisfied the threat was ended.

They dragged Vargas out the front door to a crowd already gathered in the street. A few voices called for a lynching, quickly silenced by the group. The crowd agreed on exile. Vargas was hauled to the east gate and thrown into the mud, the gate slamming behind him.

## The Holy Symbol

Eager to leave the politics behind, the group returned to the inn for their mounts. On the way, the local priest of Lathander — Lucian — begged them to help retrieve the missing bones of St. Andral to hallow the temple for the next evening's feast. The group promised to look into it the following morning.

They rode west out of Vallaki, past the path to the Vistani camp, through the Svalich woods, and arrived at Argynvostholt by midday. The fortified manor was enormous — four storeys, each twenty feet high, its east side heavily damaged and partially collapsed. A magnificent silver-plated dragon statue stood before the entrance.

Tark felt drawn to the statue. He stood beneath it, focusing on Ysera's scale, and felt the urge to dig. The rest of the group watched in confusion as their friend began clawing at the earth until Cyrrus shaped the ground away, instantly excavating an old wooden chest. Inside lay an ornate platinum amulet shaped like a stylised sun, a huge ruby set into its face. The holy power radiating from it was unmistakable.

Recalling the words of Madame Eva, the group realised they had found one of the artifacts they needed to escape Barovia — the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind.
