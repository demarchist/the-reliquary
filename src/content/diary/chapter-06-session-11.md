## Killing the Oni

Tark and Cyrrus flanked the Oni in the driving snow. Neero hurled the baby at Tark, forcing the monk to leap and catch the child — plunging beneath the snow crust in the process. The demon spun on Cyrrus and attacked in a flurry of deadly slashes, carving up the already battered warlock.

Back at the farmhouse, Patches swore when her telescope showed nothing but white. She rushed through the bedroom, stabbing a sleeping half-ogre in the head as she passed, and found Buumi smashing the skull of another with a flash of divine light before fumbling for a diamond to revive the dead farmer. Downstairs, Fëanon rushed from the house in time to see Gwen and the war-tigers sprint out of the barn. He concentrated, tore a rift to the Plane of Fire and summoned a fiery Azer with instructions to find and slay the Oni.

In the kitchen, Mr. Pickles and Gundren faced two more half-ogres. Gundren blasted one with a charged thundercannon shot, nearly killing it, and unloaded the second barrel into the one menacing Mr. Pickles. The wounded creature saw its allies dead, dove through a window and fled. The dying one in the kitchen staggered for the front door — and Gwen barrelled past Fëanon, charged her lightning blast and obliterated it in a torrent of gore. The bolt continued straight through the rear wall of the house. Outside, the fleeing half-ogre heard the blast and threw itself flat as the lightning sizzled overhead, burning it badly.

Upstairs, Buumi pressed a diamond to Ned's chest and prayed. The farmer gasped awake, the axe wound scabbing over. Lyra woke in a panic, seized her bow, and demanded to know what was happening. Buumi gave her the essentials: Neero was a demon, he had stolen their baby and fled into the blizzard. Lyra charged from the room.

Out in the storm, Tark created a compacted pocket of snow, wrapped the baby in a winter cloak and prayed the insulation would hold. He leapt from beneath the surface, shadowstepped toward the Oni — and saw Cyrrus fall from the sky, his belly opened by one massive slash. The Azer tunnelled toward the fight like a fiery mole beneath the snow.

Tark and Neero exchanged blow after blow. For every hit the monk landed, the Oni took two — but its wounds were healing faster than Tark could inflict them, and the extending katana was whittling the halfling down cut by cut. Tark summoned a globe of darkness on the sword to buy time. The Azer burst into the sphere, flanking the demon with its fiery hammer. Confused by the heat, Neero turned on the newcomer, giving Tark the opening to disengage and rush to Cyrrus's side.

In a compacted, blood-stained hole of snow, Tark found his friend pale and barely breathing. Crying, he searched his pack and pulled out a scroll of Mass Cure Wounds. He began reading, felt the magic build around him — and slip away. Without the arcane knowledge to focus it, the ink dissolved from the page. The scroll was destroyed. Tark grabbed his dying friend.

Patches leapt from her war-tiger into the snow beside them, pulled a potion from her belt and poured it down Cyrrus's throat. The warlock gasped and his eyes fluttered open. Tark let out a cry of joy and shadowstepped back into the globe of darkness.

Fëanon rode Aurora forward and threw the tiger at the Oni. The demon hurled the mount aside, but Fëanon stayed mounted and wheeled back around. The group surrounded the creature. Neero knew he was finished. He turned to gas.

The darkness spell vanished and the group was left in the falling snow, unable to see the pale mist drifting across the ice crust — until it had moved twenty feet and Fëanon felt the subtle magic of the Gaseous Form spell. He targeted it with a fireball. The detonation evaporated a huge sphere of snow into steam. When it cleared, the broken and burned body of Neero lay at the edge of the blast. It twitched. The Azer walked over and flattened its head with a fiery hammer.

Tark sprinted back to the baby. Cold and pale, but alive. He warmed the child as Buumi and Lyra arrived — the mother taking her son from the monk, weeping with relief.

## The Spirit in the Ring

The group made it back to the farmhouse. Patches stopped to loot the Oni's remains — its magical sword and a pouch of platinum — while Fëanon took the shamisen. The family was awake and in shock. Together they sealed the house, built fires and made the shelter as hospitable as they could.

During the night's reverie, Fëanon was visited by the spirit of Theodemir, his old mentor, residing within the fragment of the Last Word. Theodemir was glad to see his pupil free of the Illithid influence, but his tone was dire. The spell he had poured his very life force into — the one holding Zhengyi at bay — had been failing for the past year. A greater power was backing the Lich, slowly unravelling the enchantment. Theodemir had just nineteen hours before it collapsed entirely. He wished he had more time; he had a nugget of knowledge about time and space magic to bestow upon Fëanon before his spirit departed this plane.

Thinking fast, Fëanon pointed to his ring of mind shielding — his hand covered in dark veins from the fragment of the Atropal within. Together, master and student forced the Atropal shard from the ring and destroyed it, freeing a space for Theodemir's spirit to reside. Fëanon breathed a sigh of relief that his master might yet be restored. But Zhengyi was coming back, and there appeared to be nothing that could stop him this time.

The next morning, the group helped repair the house and dispose of the half-ogre remains. Ned thanked the gods that the group had been there, saying he owed them a debt he could never repay. But the party was not convinced the attack had been random — a creature as rare and powerful as an Oni, here, now, was too great a coincidence. Ned insisted the group push on to Silverymoon and find out why its wards had been raised.

On the road, Fëanon told the others about Theodemir's warning. Tark lifted his bag of holding and asked, panicked: did he have a lich in a bag? Fëanon tried to explain, but the information fell on panicked and less-than-receptive ears. The group doubled their pace toward the city.

## The Winter Solstice

Approaching Silverymoon, the group finally reached clear roads. Only a mile from the gates, they saw crowds of people — sleigh rides, elk and reindeer, Winter Solstice celebrations in full swing. Not the siege footing they had expected from a city with active wards.

At the Sundabar gate, they pushed to the front of a queue clogged by a burly merchant's weapons caravan. A guardsman recognised the party and let them through, handing a letter to Patches — still disguised as Stitches — as she passed through the Mythal.

Inside, the group split. Patches headed to the Spellguard offices to find Officer Li. The rest made for the Lady's College to search for something to stop Zhengyi, with Tark sprinting ahead.

Patches reached Li's office and found the door locked. She let herself in and discovered the place ransacked — the Grell case missing, coagulated blood drops behind the desk, all papers gone. She rushed out and saw the weapons merchant caravan entering the city gate in front of her. The merchants were all large, tough-looking humans who moved with the grace of trained soldiers.

## Enemies Within

Deeper in the city, the rest of the group pushed through the press of Winter Solstice revellers. Crossing the Moonbridge, Fëanon noticed fewer Amnian guards than when they had left — but more foreign travellers than the season would warrant. He looked closer and saw the pattern: groups of two or three foreigners, all very fit, all moving with military grace. In a panic, he pulled the group close and whispered that the city was being invaded. The merchants and travellers streaming through the gates were soldiers. Their wagons were laden with weapons.

Fëanon grabbed a nearby urchin, pressed coin and candy into his hand and sent him running with a note to Maximus Maximus at the House Invincible. Patches caught up and confirmed what she had seen at the gate, corroborating the suspicion.

Cyrrus decided to probe the Amnian embassy directly. He headed off, with Patches shadowing at a distance. Near the embassy, he cast an illusion to appear as an Amnian captain — but two plain-clothes soldiers witnessed the switch and began tailing him. Patches noted them and hung back further.

Cyrrus marched up to the Amnian guards and demanded to be taken to whoever was in charge, claiming he had returned from the Illithid colony with vital intelligence. The soldiers were sceptical but eventually relented and escorted him to the embassy gates. There, a guard pulled out a monocle and saw through the illusion. Cyrrus reacted instantly, casting Mass Suggestion on every guard in the area. All but one fell under his sway and — dropping the failed illusion — he was escorted inside under heavy guard.

From a nearby rooftop, Patches watched Cyrrus disappear into the building. Twenty feet away on the same roof, a figure in white clothing lay prone, covering the embassy with a heavy crossbow fitted with a telescopic sight identical to her own.

Inside, a captain halted Cyrrus and sent word up. A well-dressed Amnian watched from the second-storey foyer — middle-aged, fit, neatly trimmed hair and a precisely cut beard. After several minutes, a guard returned with the answer: Shaahir was debriefing Abdul and Cyrrus was to be sent away. Guards appeared from every hallway and door, making it clear the warlock should leave.

Just as Cyrrus turned, the sharp-looking man descended the stairs. He introduced himself as S'Olaa — Cyrrus's brother and now head of the Al'Kayan clan. In a conspiratorial whisper, S'Olaa thanked Cyrrus for killing their father; he had been waiting years to take over the family. He remarked that he had no desire to know another brother, much less a freak Tiefling, and dismissed Cyrrus with a confident smirk.

Patches saw Cyrrus leave and met him once they were out of sight. She noted the two plain-clothes soldiers breaking off their tail. They exchanged information and made for the Lady's College, Cyrrus bamfing through the city with Far Step while Patches sprinted to keep up.

## The Dean's Estate

At the college, the rest of the group found the campus largely deserted — a group of students were betting on animated snowman fights in the quad. The students informed them that the college was closed for the holiday and the Dean would be at home, though most had no idea where he lived. One young elf mentioned the Estate District. Tark sprinted off. Fëanon pressed until he had a rough description of the estate and followed, leaving Buumi and Gundren behind to wait for Patches and Cyrrus.

Fëanon caught the anxious monk and directed him to a large gated estate with a City Guard standing watch. They explained the situation — a matter of life and death — but the guard had his orders and would not let anyone inside. Tark tried to shadowstep over the ornate fence and bounced off an invisible barrier. The guard lowered his halberd and told them to leave. When they refused, he called for backup. Two more City Guards arrived. Tark tried a second time, higher, and hit the wall again.

Just as the guards lost their patience, Fëanon made one final plea. Exasperated, the original guard relented and went to knock on the door.
