A horde of Undead rises from the swamps and the group turns to face them.

They have contingencies if things get out of hand, and besides, these are undead and most of the group has a strong distaste for them.

The group charges ahead, just as a cloud of mist forms amongst the casters.

Unfazed, they start to use the Mist as cover.

Cirrus aloft on his wings calls forth a powerful abjuration and glows with radiance.

All the group save Tark become blessed and Buumi summons his Holy Nimbus

Feanon launches fireball after fireball into the amassed undead while Gundren flies in and out of the Mist concentrating his fire on one Giant at a time.

JmJm rides forwards with his Nightmare mount, Patches behind him, but is knocked from the air as his mount is pummeled to death by thrown boulders.

Other rocks sail in, but the aim is fouled by the Holy Aura and only a few strike the group.

JmJm gets up and infuriated that his mount was killed, he screams and casts a 9th level lightning bolt from his rings, blasting a line through the weaker undead and badly burning some of the giants.

Hordes of undead surge forwards, through the swamp, but Patches notices many getting dragged under the water by…something.

She webs out of a sticky situation to higher ground and calls a warning about the swamp to the group.

The horde of Giants strides forwards, massive skeletons flinging anything they can grab, trees, boulders, crates, allies.  

The return fire from the group is quickly thinning their ranks

Disconcertingly, high above, giant ghosts drift forwards on the winds, howling blasts of freezing air. 

The ghosts take a few hits, but the group quickly realizes they are regenerating and return to dealing with the corporeal threats.

One of the ghosts flings the remains of the boat at Buumi, who narrowly avoids it.

The same ghost then flings the boat into the mist, clipping Feanon and then again, directly on top of Cirrus who was hiding under a fallen pillar.

The boat and pillar badly crush Cirrus into the mud who is then beset upon by a horde of skeletons.

Arkto dives from the sky, landing next to the pillar and with a twist of his beak, grabs Cirrus by the back of his robes, hauls him out and the Owlbear takes off into the sky

Gundren continues to blast away at the giants, but enacts the radiant damage of his helmet to begin to burn the undead.

Tark rushes from Giant to Giant, climbing and pummeling them as the group continues to focus their fire (more or less)

The last of the skeletal horde is destroyed and the group turns to face the hovering ghostly forms

The spectral giants reach forth and produce spectral greatswords…
