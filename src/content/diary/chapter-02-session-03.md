Giblets splattered across the dusty room, the Undead beast has been obliterated where it lay.  The group proceeds to investigate the room, finding nothing until Patches sets here eyes on the mass of necrotic flesh still in the bed.  Steeling herself against the grossness, Patches plunges her hand in and retracts it with a beautiful golden earring.  Buumi Vomits.  The Earring is gold metal work that looks like a beetles head and legs and with a large ruby set into it as the "abdomen" .  Gundren investigates the earring, determining that it's a variation of the classic Ruby Necklace of Fireballs.  Patches looks around and finds the second earring splattered to the wall, devoid of a ruby.

The Ruby may be pulled out of the earring and thrown, mid flight, the Ruby hatches a Ruby beetle that will fly to the target desired and then explode as a DC13 Fireball.

The Beetle will follow telepathic commands from the thrower up to 150ft, altering targets, or not detonating until commanded. The beetle may be willed to hatch while still in the ear of the wielder.

Once the Ruby is used, it must be replaced.  Only a Ruby worth 1000gp can contain the magic.  Each additional 1000gp the stone is worth, increases the spell slot level of the spell and the DC by 1.

They find nothing else in the room of value.  The group then crosses the hallway to a similar door, but this one fitted far more snugly into the jam.  The check the door for traps and when confirmed safe, they open it.   Inside is a sauna; marble floors, steaming pools and thick condensation.  They carefully examine the room and Gundren spots some strange distortions in the water.  Fearing Elementals, Dr. B tries to reach out to the creatures and instead discovers they are some kind of Ooze.  Strumming his harp, JmJm coaxes the Oozes to talk rather than fight, his beautiful tunes causing them to raise to the surface as a skull faced tendril of water.   After some difficulty communicating, the group determines that the Oozes will just leave the tower if the rest of it is cleared.  Thanking the good fortune of coming across some monsters willing to talk, the group thinks nothing of the Oozes and head to the next level of the tower.  But not before finding a Red metal amulet in one of the pools (Periapt of health).

Climbing to the next floor of the tower, the group enters a massive forge room, with animated suits of armor working tirelessly to produce jewelry and other simple treasures.  The group is fully taken in by the spectacle, and inch towards the treasure.  Patches however thinks it too convenient and strange, and for a second sees through the illusion.  The rest of the group is fully taken in until Shauna makes her way to the forge, and can't quite tell if she feels heat from it or not.  Patches breaks through the illusion, as Dr.B causes flowers to bloom from nothingness.  Patches sees a large empty chamber, completely void except for in the center of the floor is a large glowing crystal ball.  Going over to touch it and possibly pry it from the floor.  Patches is thrown away in a blast of energy, thrown against the wall and sustaining injury.  Buumi, on Patches command goes over to the forge and slashes down into it with his Ogre enchanced strength.  Willing through the illusion, even as the rest of the party struggles and believes they truly are surrounded by treasure, Buumi smashes the Crystal Orb.  In an explosion of energy, the illusion vanishes and the crystal shards smoke and spark in the center of the floor.  The group gathers the shards of the destroyed ball and heads up to the final level.

The reach the top floor and see a hulking redskinned humanoid wrapped in chains stalking between arcane equipment.  The group enters and fans out without being detected.  Strumming to get it's attention JmJm initiates a dialogue with the Chain Devil.  JmJm convinces the Devil that they are Ashmodai and sent here as allies to secure the tower.  Patches steps from the shadows to add to the tale, telling the Devil he had clearly failed in it's mandate to protect and secure the tower as the group had gotten all the way to the top.  As the Devil thought about it, the group sprung their trap, attacking the Devil.  Crossbow bolts, longbow arrows, Thundercannon lightning blasts, Druid whips and a Smiting stroke from Buumi's Longsword deals massive damage to the Devil and it reels under the assault.  It quickly regains it's wits, causing several nearby chains to animate and swipe at the group.  One grapples JmJm, one grapples Gundren and another swipes harmlessly at Buumi and another at Patches.  The Devil himself smashes Buumi with his chains causing blood to mar the new Plate armor.  Patches rushes to the side of the Demon, stabbing it deeply with The Reaver and letting her sword feed on it's life force.  The Devil is destroyed and turned to dust.  The group begins to search the level, but a flash of white light has the group returned to the tent of Sha'Alazzi where he exclaims their success.  The group asks for their reward and store owner agrees after some haggling of the deals wording.  Eventually Sha' concedes and still gives the group a magical item despite the loot they got from the tower.  Lothli receives Bracers of Archery.  He tells her to put them to good use in the archery competition.

The group moves to head out of the store, but not before Tark and Fey'Anon approach the group within the pavilion of Sha'Alazzi.
