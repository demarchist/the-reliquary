With the undead beast obliterated, the group investigated the remains. Patches eyed the mass of necrotic flesh still in the bed. Steeling herself against the grossness, she plunged her hand in and withdrew a beautiful golden earring. Buumi vomited. The earring was shaped like a beetle's head and legs, set with a large ruby as the abdomen. Gundren identified it as a variation of the Ruby Necklace of Fireballs — the ruby could be pulled out and thrown, hatching mid-flight into a ruby beetle that would fly to a designated target and detonate as a fireball. The beetle obeyed telepathic commands up to 150 feet and could be willed to hatch while still in the ear of the wielder. Once used, the ruby had to be replaced with one worth at least 1,000 gold, with more valuable stones increasing the spell's power. Patches found the matching earring splattered against the wall, its ruby missing.

## The Sauna

Crossing the hallway, the group found the right door fitted snugly into its jamb. Inside was a sauna — marble floors, steaming pools, and thick condensation. Gundren spotted strange distortions in the water, and fearing elementals, Doctor Breakfast reached out to investigate. They turned out to be some kind of ooze. JmJm coaxed them to the surface with his harp, where they formed a skull-faced tendril of water and attempted to communicate. After some difficulty, the group determined the oozes would simply leave the tower once the rest was cleared. The group found a red metal Periapt of Health in one of the pools.

## The Forge Illusion

Climbing to the next floor, the group entered a massive forge room where animated suits of armor worked tirelessly to produce jewelry and simple treasures. The spectacle was mesmerizing, and the group inched toward the glittering hoard — all except Patches, who thought it too convenient. For a moment, she saw through the illusion. Pushing through the enchantment, she saw the truth: a large empty chamber with nothing but a glowing crystal ball in the center of the floor.

Patches went to pry the crystal loose and was blasted backward against the wall. Buumi, on Patches' command, willed himself through the illusion and smashed the crystal orb with his ogre-enhanced gauntlets. The illusion shattered, leaving only sparking, smoking shards on the bare stone floor. The group gathered the fragments and headed up to the final level.

## The Chain Devil

The top floor held a hulking red-skinned humanoid wrapped in chains, stalking between arcane equipment. JmJm opened with diplomacy, convincing the chain devil they were servants of Asmodeus sent to secure the tower. Patches stepped from the shadows to press the point — the devil had clearly failed its mandate, given that intruders had reached the top floor unchallenged. While the devil pondered this, the group sprang their trap.

Crossbow bolts, longbow arrows, thundercannon blasts, druid whips, and a smiting stroke from Buumi's longsword slammed into the devil simultaneously. It reeled but recovered, animating nearby chains to grapple JmJm and Gundren while lashing at Buumi and Patches. The devil's own chains scarred Buumi's new plate armor. Patches rushed to the devil's flank and buried The Reaver deep, letting the cursed blade feed on its life force. The chain devil dissolved to dust.

## Return to Sha'Alazzi

As the group began to search the level, a flash of white light transported them back to Sha'Alazzi's tent. The merchant congratulated them on their success. After some haggling over the exact wording of the reward deal, Sha'Alazzi conceded and awarded Lothli a pair of Bracers of Archery despite the loot they'd taken from the tower. He told her to put them to good use in the archery competition.

As the group moved to leave, Tark and Fëanon approached from within the pavilion — they had been separated the entire time.
