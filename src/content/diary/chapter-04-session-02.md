Descending farther and farther, the group eventually finds themselves suspended thousands of feet up in the air, a vast bog stretching out before them, ruins visible and a massive labyrinth stretching horizon to horizon.  The stairs the group had been descending simply ends, as if the "tower" containing the stairs was destroyed and fell to the earth far below. The group investigates and comes up with nothing.  Several members of the group begin to convulse and shrink, turning into tiny inchworms with their own humanoid heads.  Shrugging, Fey'anon creates a tiny harness and straps them to his chest.  Using Tarks robes of featherfall, he then leaps from the building and slowly begins to descend.

Deciding to just ask for answers, Cyrrus headed back to Foxy Crazy asked her about the destroyed stairs, to which Foxy replied she did not know about.  Cyrrus takes Foxy down to see the destroyed stairs, but when they get their, Foxy claims to see no damage.  Cyrrus asks to be carried down and Foxy obliges, carrying her sweetheart down invisible steps.  Figuring it for an illusion, Buumi takes his first step into mid air…and begins to fall.  Only the quick thinking of Fey'Anon saves Buumi and he is grabbed from the air.  The rest of the group begins Piling on to the slowly descending Wizard, held in place by Buumi's superior strength.

As the group is falling, they see a large settlement off in the bog, and upon inspecting the labyrinth from the air, they notice it continually re arranging itself.

Some time later, the group lands on a massive Chantrelle mushroom in the bog below.  Foxy Crazy, carrying Cyrrus not far behind.

The group begins to explore the bog, with Lothli moving out onto a slipperly log.  She loses her footing and falls into the bog below and is immediately swarmed by unknown creatures. Luckily, Gundren pulls Lothli from the water with a winch before they can find out what the creatures are.

Before Crazy Foxy leaves, she mentions that the group should probably find shelter at night and introduces two Goblin Crows which begin helping the group out (a little).  Fey'Anon uses his telepathy to feel around and finds that many of the mushrooms are sentient, hearing them all chanting "grow, grow, grow".

Buumi heads off in a different direction and the moment he steps off of  the mushroom, onto a smaller mushroom and is eaten!  The mushroom being a trap.  He's pulled down quickly to the bog before he can break free and jump to safety, moments before being dragged below the water and devoured.

On the other side of things, Doc. B explores the other side of the log with Gundren and comes across a tea party, headed by a massive cat-like creature; a Grimalkin.  The Malk is friendly, and offers some advice, and warns the group to beware the Black Dragon in the nearby fallen tower that eats people.  At this, Doc.B realizes that's the direction Buumi was headed and rushes to warn Buumi.

Buumi however stumbles into the fallen tower, surrounded by moss, and is charged by a massive Black Dragon.  Thinking he's about to one on one a Dragon, Buumi beseeches for mercy at which point the dragon notices him.  Thinking him a Goblin and deciding to eat him, the Dragon had not actually noticed the dragon before Buumi said something.  Hoping to garner some interest from the Dragon, Buumi throws off his disguise which startles the Dragon, thinking it was face to face with a Goblin before.   Intrigued, the Dragon stops and begins to talk.  Buumi lays on the charm as hard as possible, actually winning some affection from the Dragon, which shapeshifts into a beautiful woman and begins to charm him right back. Before long, the Dragon is making moves on a very terrified Buumi, but he goes with it thinking that it's preferable to being eaten.  At this point he sees through an illusion, and sees that all the moss he was surrounded by was in fact Goblins, and they are all eagerly watching.

While this is happening, Cyrrus and Fey decide to simply try flying to Goblin town and take flight with a spell from Cyrrus.  On the way, they are distracted and fly over to the ruined tower and land in a tree.

Lothli and Doc B. head over to Buumi in an attempt to warn him of the danger and Gundren, over at the Tea Party is startled when a cadre of Mushroom men march past with weapons.
