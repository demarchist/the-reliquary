The staircase ended thousands of feet in the air. Below, a vast bog stretched to every horizon — ruins dotted the wetlands and a massive labyrinth sprawled from edge to edge, its walls visibly rearranging themselves. The tower containing the stairs had been destroyed, leaving nothing but open sky beneath the final step.

## The Descent

Several members of the group began to convulse and shrink, their bodies twisting into tiny inchworms with their own humanoid heads — a side effect of the demiplane's magic. Fëanon shrugged, fashioned a tiny harness, strapped the worm-bodied companions to his chest, donned Tark's robes of featherfall, and leaped into the void.

Cyrrus, thinking practically, went back to ask Foxy Crazy about the destroyed stairs. She claimed to see no damage and cheerfully carried her sweetheart down what appeared to be invisible steps. Figuring it an illusion, Buumi took a confident step into midair — and plummeted. Fëanon snatched him from the fall just in time. The rest of the group piled onto the slowly descending wizard, held in place by Buumi's grip. In the distance, they could see a large settlement in the bog: Goblin Town.

They landed on a massive chanterelle mushroom. The bog was treacherous from the start — Lothli stepped out onto a slippery log, lost her footing, and splashed into the water, where unknown creatures swarmed her instantly. Gundren hauled her out with a winch before they could find out what the things were. Fëanon reached out telepathically and discovered the mushrooms were sentient, all of them chanting in unison: *grow, grow, grow.*

## The Black Dragon

Buumi wandered off alone and stepped onto a smaller mushroom that swallowed him whole — a carnivorous trap. He tore free and leaped to safety moments before being dragged beneath the water. Pressing on, he stumbled into a fallen tower surrounded by moss and found himself face to face with a massive Black Dragon.

Buumi beseeched for mercy, which was the wrong move — the dragon had not actually noticed him before he spoke. Thinking him a goblin and deciding to eat him, the dragon lunged. Buumi threw off his garbage disguise in desperation. The dragon stopped, startled to find something other than a goblin, and its curiosity was piqued. Buumi laid on the charm as hard as he could, and against all odds, he won the creature's affection. The dragon shifted into the form of a beautiful woman and began charming him right back. Before long, things escalated — and a terrified Buumi went along with it, reasoning it was preferable to being eaten. At some point he saw through an illusion and realised the moss surrounding them was actually goblins, all watching with great enthusiasm.

Meanwhile, Doctor Breakfast and Gundren explored the other side of a log and discovered a tea party hosted by a massive cat-like creature — a Malk called Demetrius. The friendly Grimalkin offered advice and warned the group about the Black Dragon in the nearby tower that ate people. Doctor Breakfast realised with horror that was exactly where Buumi had gone.

Cyrrus and Fëanon, having decided to simply fly to Goblin Town, were distracted by the commotion and landed in a tree above the tower. Below them, Buumi's encounter was already well underway. Armed myconids marched past Gundren at the tea party, and the bog's dangers were becoming clearer by the minute.
