Restrained by the wall of hands,  Tark struggles to be freed but does not succeed and is tickled by the walls.  Fey'anon reads the creatures mind and hears "FEED!" and imparts this to the group telepathically.  Figuring their comrade to be in mortal danger, the group attacks the wall with Zhink going so far as to jump in after Tark and get immediately held.  Doc. B proceeds to spray poison onto the wall.  Fey launches a Lightning bolt and Buumi blesses and buffs those around him. 

Cyrrus still has his flight spell active and dives in, flying down to Tark just as he frees himself and begins to fall.  Suddenly, the wall asks a riddle about hands.  The group answers the riddle and abruptly the wall is too preoccupied with laughing to attack.  With the threat ended, Buumi sets up a Shrine to Helm and begins to pray over his egg, he gets Zhink to pray with him (as he is Buumi's squire).  Cyrrus catches Tark, but sees an exit to the tunnel, flying down.  The tunnel of hands opens up into a massive crystal Geode with a single chest in the center of a crystal Island.  They go to open the chest, only to find that it is a mimic.  Cyrrus then dimension doors back to the top of the tunnel and the group set down to rest a little.

While the others begin to set up a makeshift camp, Tark wanders out of the skull and sees one of the racing snails asleep across a short gap of water.  Tark creatues a sphere of darkness, centered on a stone and tosses the stone to where the snail is so he can teleport to the shadow.  The moment he appears on the island however, an angry Treant rips itself from the ground, flailing and clips Tark.  Hearing the commotion, the group begins to head towards the sounds until they see a massive Treans rise out of the globe of darkness, and a racing snail with Tark on it's back zipping from the scene at high speed.  The group retreats back into the skull to hide from the Treant and Doc.B slips out of the eye socket in pursuit of Tark.  Doc B. almost makes it over the carnivorous mushrooms but at the last moment is grabbed and eaten.  Close behind, Zhink summons a magical bow and shoots a flaming arrow into the stem of the mushroom, killing it. Doc B. manages to scramble to safety, atop a large mound.

Behind them, the Treant lets out a massive roar, which is echoed across the swamp by other screeches,  the Treant then brings another tree nearby to life.

Tark finally manages to get control of his snail with an illusion of a cabbage and steers it back to the group.  In the process, he sprays the Malc with swamp water.

On the mound, Doc B. is surprised as it gets to it's feet, a huge turtle head swing around to regard her.  Giving the turtle a cabbage, Doc B. befriends it and gets it to hurry quickly back to the group with Tark just behind.  The two mounts make it back to the group which are ready to leave, what with the looming Treant.  Fey'Anon snatches up the worm-bodied forms of the other group members and casts haste on the Turtle so it can keep up with the snail.  Both mounts then jet off into the night, the turtle biting off the head of a random Goblin as it passes.

Heading to Goblin town, the group decides to rest up as best they can on the mounts.  While they rest however, each of them have horrific nightmares and finds themselves changed in some way.  Buumi grew a tail, but cut it off continually until it stopped, but his spine has become hunched and he cannot stand straight,  he wonders if he simply did not have enough faith in helm and that the tail may have been a blessing.  Fey'Anon had a giant octopi tentacle grow from his lower back and his eyes have turned red.  Tark has horrible toe fungus sprouting.  Doc B. was shrunk to be small enough to ride her horse.  Zhink's reflexes have been enchanced .  Lay on hands, prayer and healing could not remove the curses.
