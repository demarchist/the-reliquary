Tark struggled against the grasping hands but could not break free — the wall tickled him instead of crushing him. Fëanon read the creature's mind and heard a single word: *FEED.* He relayed this telepathically, and the group assumed the worst. Zhink jumped in after Tark and was immediately caught. Doctor Breakfast sprayed poison onto the wall while Fëanon launched a lightning bolt and Buumi blessed those around him.

## The Riddle

Cyrrus, still flying from an earlier spell, dove down to catch Tark just as he tore free and began to fall. Suddenly the wall asked a riddle about hands. The group answered correctly, and the wall was so consumed with laughter that it forgot to attack. With the threat ended, Buumi set up a shrine to Helm and prayed over his dragon egg, drafting Zhink — his unofficial squire — to pray alongside him. Cyrrus caught Tark and spotted an exit at the tunnel's bottom, flying down to find a massive crystal geode with a single chest on a crystal island. The chest was a mimic. Cyrrus dimension-doored back to the top.

## The Racing Snail

While the group made camp inside the skull, Tark wandered outside and spotted one of the Bog's racing snails sleeping across a short gap of water. He created a sphere of darkness, tossed it to the snail's island, and shadow-stepped across. The moment he appeared, a furious treant ripped itself from the ground and clipped him. The group saw a massive tree rise from the globe of darkness — and a racing snail with Tark on its back zip away at alarming speed. They retreated into the skull as the treant roared, its cry echoed across the swamp by other creatures.

Doctor Breakfast slipped out through the skull's eye socket in pursuit. She nearly cleared the carnivorous mushrooms but was grabbed at the last moment and swallowed. Zhink summoned a magical bow and put a flaming arrow through the mushroom's stem, killing it. Doctor Breakfast scrambled to safety atop a large mound — which promptly stood up, revealing itself to be an enormous turtle. She fed it a cabbage and befriended it on the spot.

Tark gained control of his snail by dangling an illusory cabbage. The two new mounts raced back to the group, the turtle biting the head off a random goblin as it passed. Fëanon gathered the worm-bodied companions and cast haste on the turtle to keep pace. Both mounts tore off into the night toward Goblin Town.

## The Bog's Curse

During the ride, each of them suffered horrific nightmares. They woke changed. Buumi grew a tail and cut it off repeatedly until it stopped regrowing, but his spine had become permanently hunched — he could no longer stand straight. He wondered privately whether the tail had been a blessing from Helm and he had simply lacked the faith to accept it. Fëanon sprouted a giant octopus tentacle from his lower back and his eyes turned crimson. Tark found horrible fungus growing from his toes. Doctor Breakfast had shrunk to the size of her miniature horse. Zhink's reflexes, already supernatural, were enhanced further. Lay on hands, prayer, and healing magic could not remove the curses.
