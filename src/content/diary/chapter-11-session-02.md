The group moves the bodies away from the Ringed Veils (Fargates)

As they do, they realize that one of the bodies is regenerating - the strange cultist that was much harder to kill.

Buumi recognizes the energies around it as undead and they burn the body to stop it from being an issue later.

They turn away from the Gates for now, intent on finding where this large batch of enemies had come from.

Backtracking a little, the group finds the doorways that were cleared of the black webs by Cirrus and check beyond them.

Several have collapsed tunnels, but one was recently traveled and the group finds where the Cultists had been holed up.

In the barracks they find a Mural depicting the Saurian race and a planet with two suns.

Cirrus recognizes the significance of the dual suns, connecting his vision of the fragment of the word with this mural.

They are on the right path, he is sure of it.

Searching the cultists effects, the group finds several more necromantic totems to a god no one recognizes as well as a distinct lack of money and coin.

The only thing they did find were thin linen-like clothes, bone dice and similar miscellaneous trash

Cirrus returns to the Gate room ahead of the group and prays to Selune, Communing with his goddess to try and find the way forward.

He determines the correct path and leads the group through to the other side, touching the shimmering mirror of energy and being transported.

The group finds themselves instantly transported to a strange desertlike plane punctuated by Stalagmites that extends before them

 a shimmering field of energy at the edge of the Gate platform separates them from this new world.

Three of the four Gate platforms are occupied and three Ringed Veils stand active.

The group moves around the area, investigating their options and looking at this strange place.

Tark spots a camp, just on the other side of the barrier and shadowsteps out to investigate - past a circle of skulls projecting some kind of magic.

Meanwhile the group tests the active Gates, determining the correct one forwards, but not before Snorbul is affected by the wrong gate and starts to see weird jellyfish in the sky.

Tark begins to check the desolate camp, but at that same moment, pushes through an Illusion spell covering the area - created by the line of skulls.

The Stalagmites have been moving closer and each has a glowing red eye at its center and an array of tendrils. 

Around the camp, Tark sees corpses, each with their brains sucked out through a large gaping hole in the backs of their skulls…

The Roper-like monstrosities surge forward just as Tark retreats, calling the danger to the group.

Tendrils try to grab Tark and Snorbul, but cannot find purchase on the slippery smallfolk

The group makes haste and they flee through the gate they know to be safe.

And find themselves in a completely different place.

The sky is filled with stars and swirling nebulae and the group finds themselves on a Gate Platform surrounded by blue Jungle.

The sounds of breaking glass and conflagrations reaches the group and as they look around, a nearby spire of stone, clearly of Saurian design can be seen under attack from bottles of Alchemists fire.

Snorbul and Tark move in on the flying broom to look at the Spire while the others move into the jungle to see who is attacking.

Snorbul and Tark both move in stealthily, making the top of the spire with ease.

There, they see the alchemists fire smashing against an invisible barrier created by a ring of skulls similar to what they had seen before.

A dozen cultists shelter behind the barrier.

Tark shadowsteps to a skull and puts the candle out that burns within.

The defensive barrier immediately ceases and the next hurled bottle of alchemists fire smashes at the feet of a cluster of cultists who immediately burst into flame.

Another handful of flasks soar in and explode amongst the panicking cultists.

Tark shadowsteps away, leaping into the sky just as Snorbul soars in to catch him and they fly back to the group as the spire burns.

Below, they see the group has met up with the throwers of the flasks - a group of Veygar’s Duergar.

The group, and Duergar survivors head back to the Gate platform to talk.

They determine that the “mine” with the mural of the Word is deeper into the network and the Duergar survivors here are a bit lost, having fled the veritable army of black robed cultists that attacked them.

They determined the cultists are from further through the network of gates and not native to Faerun.

Tark and Snorbul bring over the corpse of a corrupted Cultists and it regenerates enough to converse.

The thing is almost impossible to understand, Feanon and Cirrus picking up some words from an older dialect of common, though the speech is slurred with blood and tar.

Tark acts as the translator, but the thing cackling with madness, reciting scripture and offering nothing but death from the god “Zalaam”.

Buumi burns it away with fire, killing it properly.

They head through the gate and find a gate platform, reality warped and twisted beyond recognition.

Three gates here are active and Patches tries the first, but finds herself being crushed by some magic and the group intervenes, thus leaving the other gate as the way forwards.

Unwilling to test the boundary of reality here in this place, the group leaves.

In the next area, they find themselves at a hub, with a Gate platform with four active gates, a Barn nearby and a large human-made Inn nearby.

Misty meadows surround the area and the fields go off into the mists.

The group cautiously moves in to investigate this place.

They check the barn first, finding unfamiliar beasts of burden here, dead and bitten by strange ghoul-like/zombie corpses, also nearby.  Black ooze and corruption is present around the wounds, not unlike the ooze they have seen before on the webbing and resilient cultists.

They move into the Inn building itself, finding signs of battle.  The cult clearly has been here.

On the second floor, they find a dead Duergar and a barricaded door.

They open it and are immediately attacked by three undead Duergar that had been motionless on the other side.

The beasts are quickly slain and the group determines what happened when Buumi stumbles out of the room, his eyes swelling and leaking fluid and black tar leaking from his nose.

It takes him a second as he focuses and the power of Helm cleanses the disease from him.

Buumi warns the others and gestures to the spore and black web filled room that held the undead creatures.

Creatures that after inspection, are revealed to be turned Duergar.  The one on the outside having locked his infected friends in the room…

Whatever this corruption is, it could even infect Buumi who is supposedly protected from such things by Helm.

Assembling outside the corrupted inn, the group decides to burn it down and move on.

As the spore-filled house begins to light, they move to a gate and move through it, not checking its destination ahead of time.

On the other side, the party is hurled from a free floating gate, contained within a void.

As the group “falls” each group member enacts some form of magic (wings, Arcto, flight spells) to arrest their fall, but with the speed of their fall, it takes long enough that the gate is no longer visible.

Something else is though, as a great plane of orange grass expands below, suddenly visible.

The field of grass is several miles across.

At the “center” of the plane of grass sits the largest tree anyone has ever seen. A vast ancient thing, maybe the last great living thing in this reality.

Beyond the field of grass, reality simply ceases.

As the group lands on the “ground” they see a camp near the base roots of the World Tree and decide to head over to investigate.

They find several corpses of Ghouls near the camp and then come across the camp resident - a Human cultist named Haszzm.

Unlike the other cultists, this man does not attack (indeed, he is quite intimidated by the large group before him).

Once again, his dialect is strange, but the group parlays and eventually, are invited into the camp by the man, who has defected from the Cult of Zalaam.

The group sits around the fire and talk with the man.

He has a runestone that will return them to the Crossroads and take them from this strange world and he is eager to help.

In return, he asks that the group help him find his friend Jamil.

He explains that he joined the cult in **Al Askar, in the city if Iyum** as it was better than the alternative life there.

Only after he joined did he realize how evil this “religion” was.

The group listens to his story and they agree to take him with them and look for his friend.

He nods and they prepare to leave.
