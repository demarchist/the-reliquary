The group wakes from their long rest and begin to go about their morning routine

Feanon however is shaking and rocking back and forth

The waking nightmare continues and he flinches as he sees *things *moving around the camp

One particularly bad looking creature moves too close and he launches a firebolt which splashes harmlessly against a nearby boulder

The rest of the group comes on alert and looks around for a threat which is not there

Buumi moves in to reassure his friend, casting a healing spell upon him just in case.  It helps, but does not alleviate the issue.

As the group is dealing with Feanon, a wanderer has spotted the camp and moves in to take a look.

A lone wood elf, atop a Tujalri mount appears on a nearby ridge and looks over the camp

The group spots the elf and they gather themselves to take stock of the newcomer, figuring out if he is friend or foe.

Gundren summons Arkto, JmJm summons his Nightmare steed (which manifests as a fiery drake) and Snorbul hops on his flying broom.

The elf is instantly cowed and begins to back off seeing so many magical forces

Buumi and Tark head over though and welcome the elf who introduces himself as Ventari, a treasure hunter looking for something valuable to bring back to his clan.

Buumi and Tark do their best to convince the elf that they are a decent bunch and they invite him back for breakfast, to which he agrees.

Back around the campfire and with breakfast going well again (after Patches burned the eggs) they begin to discuss next steps.

The group is still unsure where their next objective should be; they talk about the Volcano, the Temple of Vaketh, Sharza and the portal to the Fae Wild circulate.

The newcomer is taken aback, that this eccentric group would be so casually talking about such things.

The group uses the opportunity to ask a native what he knows of each of their potential objectives.

V says that the most promising (for him) would be the Fiery Gorge on Mt. Saqar (the Volcano) as legend says a Titanic Forge exists there.

He is adamant though that the Temples of the Gods, and especially Sharza, are a complete death trap and only the suicidal or foolish would venture there.

As the discussion continues, Patches receives a communique on the Sending Tablet from **Hasrala, the ancient Saurian scholar**.

Hasrala believes that he knows of a location with a database of addresses for the Ringed Veils, and a way for the group to get back to Faerun.

He tells of an ancient manufactory, many hundreds of miles to the West, in the **Thueba Swamp**

This new information changes things for the group as this is their first major lead on a way home that did not come from one of the gods of this world.

The group puts it to a vote and they decide that as they are so close to the Volcano of Mt. Saqar, they will venture in and investigate the Fiery Gorge for the Titanic Forge and look for this supposed Dragon that needs their help.

After that though, they will head for Thueba Swamp for the coordinates home and if they pass by Sharza, City of the Dead, they will at least scout it and see what they are up against.

The newcomer, Ventari, shakes his head at their foolishness in going to Sharza, but is more than willing to head into Mt. Saqar.

They pack up camp and begin the trek to the nearby volcano.

After only an hour of hiking, the terrain has changed markedly.

No longer sandy badlands, the terrain is now volcanic and the heat, already intense, has become downright oppressive.

The black sand and grit of the area is punctuated by smoking pits that stink of sulfur.

As they look up at the ominous mountain, they see a massive chasm on the side of the mountain.

Ventari points it out as The Fiery Gorge, and their initial destination on the mountainside. 

They trudge forwards, wiping the sweat and soot from their eyes

Buumi looks down just as he steps on something that crushes and gives way.

A harsh red glow illuminated him as he stumbles and almost falls head first into a pool of lava, the thin hardened crust unable to bear his weight.

V grabs the man and pulls him back, saving Buumi from the terrible heat of the magma.

The group then begins to check their footing, scanning the area for unstable sections

As they do, they note charred humanoid remains and a fair amount of them

They keep their hands near their weapons and actively begin to look around for danger.

They push forwards, making the opening of the Fiery Gorge on the mountain side and pushing forwards, into the Volcano itself.

The sky quickly becomes obscured by the ash and gasses of the volcano, with the only light coming from the red glow of the lava saturating the area.

Charred remains can still be seen scattered around and the heat of the place actively burns any exposed skin.

The group is fighting for breath and quickly becoming exhausted by the extreme inhospitality of this place.

Luckily for them, the Gorge itself is relatively short, and after only a half mile, the walls of the gorge expand and open up into the crater of the volcano itself.

The group looks ahead; the haze of the heat, and volcanic gases making it difficult to make out specifics, but what they do see is quite a sight.

A massive lake of lava, fed by a lava-fall, a thousand feet tall and a hundred feet wide, dominates the area.

At one point, the group stops and hides as they see a great shape resolve on the other side of the lava river.

A large humanoid figure of ash, smoke and fire strides to the edge of the magma, grabs something from underneath the flowing molten stone, and then continues on its way, striding along the shore for some time before disappearing into the smog.

The group looks at one another wide eyed and they move forwards carefully despite the horrendous heat.

Scattered pools of lava expand outward from the lake of magma and the ruins of some truly ancient city can be seen rising from the liquid stone.

*Something *can be seen on the rim of the caldera; the source of the great lava-falls and other movement can be seen, though specifics are obscured by the venting gases.

The group moves forward, careful to avoid falling into any of the flowing lava

There is a blast of air and a renting sound nearby and the group braces themselves, unsure what could have caused such a sound.

Moments later, molten stone begins to rain from the sky, burning the group as they scramble for cover.

They hunker down against the falling stone and burning lava, as other movement catches their attention and they hide themselves with concealing magics.

Not a moment too soon, as great hulking, bony forms resolve out of the volcanic gases

Great fiends stalk across the stone, investigating and looking around

The pack does not spot the group and after a few minutes, they move off and become lost in the thick smog of the crater.

The group looks at one another, uncertainty painted across everyone’s faces, save for Gundren, whose eyes are locked on the partially submerged ruins. They keep moving forward.

As they do, a ruined arch resolves from the smog and Gundren walks up to it, putting his hand on the stone; it’s ancient, and not crafted by mortal hands.

He says that it’s Titanic, and marvelous.

The group moves forwards, following a large lava-flow that gets wider, and wider as they head through the gorge

After another hour of moving through the smog, ash, and fire filled landscape, the group finds themselves at the shores of the vast lake of magma, and not far from the great Lavafall.

They spot a massive arched bridge spanning the lake of magma, but the thing ends under the lava-falls

The group finally gets a good view at the source of the flowing magma - a gargantuan worm.

The thing is hundreds of feet above the group and massive; the bulk of the creature lost to the fog as its maw, twenty feet wide, disgorges an endless stream of molten stone.

The group stands, awestruck and they turn to talk and discuss; what do they do?

They have a feeling that this is simply a great beast, but they know not why it sits there, disgorging lava.

They suspect that if they can get through the lava-falls using the ancient bridge, there is likely something of great interest on the other side - Gundren theorizes it would be the Forge, based on the architectural importance of the bridge in this space.

They wrap themselves in concealing magics again, unwilling to startle the great worm and note packs of fiends prowling the area.

They begin to move across the bridge, toward the falls.

When they get close, Cirrus creates a wall of force to cut through the lava and create a protective roof.

The protected walkway is *thin *and the heat is almost unbearable, forcing the group to rush through or be cooked.

They all get singed and burned by the lava-falls and Buumi almost refuses to walk through it, until Patches takes his hand and leads him through.

Cirrus lets the wall of force go and the thin channel of “safety” disappears in a deluge of fiery stone.

They turn and survey where they have ended up; a great tunnel of Titanic design, leading deep into the volcano.

Gundren is now certain, and Ventari backs him up, that this is the way to the forge and they head forwards.

As they reach a large room leading to the Forge, Feanon is visited by another hallucination; Zalaam, hooded in human form, asks him "Why do you deal with these pathetic mortals? They are not as powerful as you are. They should be your thralls and submit to you."

Feanon, not realizing it is a hallucination, rushes forward to try to negotiate with Zalaam. The group follows quickly after Faenon, wondering who he is talking to.

As the group passes under a great archway, a trap is sprung.  From high above a bucket of lava and stone is dumped upon the group by some unknown agent

The group scrambles out of the way, but they each are badly burned by the fiery stone.

The group realizes that they are not alone and they push forwards with more caution.

Up ahead, the grand tunnel can be seen illuminated by the harsh red glow of magma, and the group begins to hear a commotion.

Everyone begins to hide and move forwards carefully.

A few moments later, they see a strange spectacle.

Past this tunnel is a vast cavern lit by the light of lava pools and magma. Many chains, pulleys, and cages hang from the ceiling. Past that you see a dragon, red and crystalline in nature, chained up in front of an ancient Titanic forge, being tortured and prodded by a group of cultists in black robes wearing skull masks. The cultists punish the creature and you hear a piercing cry of pain from the dragon as it slumps over: it appears to be too weak to set itself free.

The group slinks forwards, noting the Cultists that serve Zalaam, prodding the Crystal Dragon with firelances.

They look on, and see the cult leader addressing the Ruby Crystal Dragon





The group notes the glittering, massive chains restraining the Ruby Dragon

They discuss a plan of action and decide that Patches should flank the cultists and try and to get to the Dragon to set it free, as there’s no lock she hasn't been able to get past.

Patches agrees and turns to climb up the nearby wall and the group quickly loses sight of her.

The group slinks closer, and the words of the cult leader become discernible

He is trying to convince the dragon to join their cause.

As the rest of the group fans out, a cultist moves up to the leader and says something.

The leader turns and looks down the tunnel, at the approaching group, but does not see them.

He says something to the other cultists and they come on guard.

Realizing that whoever dumped the lava on them earlier in the tunnel, just warned the cultists of their approach 

Buumi and JmJm, decide to give them what the cult is clearly expecting and move out from stealth.

The bard and paladin stride forwards as the obvious targets while their friends get into position and they buy Patches more time.

The cult leader speaks, addressing them, his words exuding magic - He says they were expected, for their Lord Zalaam told them of their arrival. He says the group should join him, or to leave while they still can; to get as far away from this world, and their own, as soon as possible. For Zalaam will soon engulf Gaia into glorious darkness, and that Toril is next. He says there is nothing that the heroes can do to stop the cult or Zalaam, for the world of Toril is already under the influence of Zalaam and his kin. The corruption is already in the Underdark and is spreading because of the alghouls. He says “you have heard the words of our lord and the demise of this world,” then “ and you have heard the words of doom and destruction from Zalaam’s brother in Toril; the death of your world is inevitable, as is this one!”
