Rested and ready, the group advanced cautiously down the hallway. Tark scouted ahead and peered through a keyhole to find six Duergar in a workshop on the other side. Several were working a set of three plinths holding colored gemstones, with a pile of clear crystals in the corner awaiting infusion.

The group hatched a plan: Cirrus would distract several Duergar with a complex illusion while Fëanon used mage hand to snatch a newly infused gem through the door. The illusion worked beautifully, but the plan was foiled by the locked door — the gem smashed into the lock, buckling the wood. Buumi readied himself and judged his timing, kicking the door in the instant a Duergar came to investigate. The grey dwarf reacted with blinding speed, catching the door on his shield instead of his face, but the group stormed in regardless.

Spells and arrows flew. Guenwhyvar leaped in and bore one dwarf to the ground. Buumi engaged the nearest while another was put to sleep and a third was entangled in druidic vines. Lothli laid down a barrage of fire, and an illusion of a gold dragon appeared, startling the Duergar. The grey dwarves were slaughtered quickly — but just as the fight ended, one of them vanished using her innate powers of invisibility. The assassin slipped from the room before anyone could cover the door.

Using the workshop's plinths, the group infused a clear crystal with purple energy and used it to open the previously locked cage room, recovering three Greater Healing Potions and an Oil of Sharpness. They then returned to the sarcophagi room — unwilling to leave potential enemies behind them — and barricaded the chamber for a long rest.
