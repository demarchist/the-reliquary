## The Battle's End

The street was choked with corpses. Patches faced three shambling zombies — dodging and parrying, taking only superficial hits, though the Reaver's constant drain on her life force was making her look alarmingly pale. Across the way, Gundren lay unconscious and bleeding against a crate. Buumi started toward him but Gowain shadowstepped into his path and delivered a stunning blow to the paladin's head, sending him staggering to one knee, his helmet askew. Gowain laughed.

Fëanon hasted Patches and ducked behind a building. Cyrrus cast a globe of darkness on his owl to obscure himself. By the blazing church, Gwen clawed futilely at the vampire dwarf Kenga, whose heavy plate turned every strike. Tark shadowstepped to Kenga and smashed his enormous nose flat — it immediately began reforming.

Patches used her web bracer to zip to a rooftop, searching for Arrigal. She leapt over the edge — and heard the displacement of air on soft cloth. The Vistani assassin hung in the sky, supported by dark mist, crossbow levelled at her face. *"For my wife!"* he snarled. The bolt came fast. Patches cut it from the air and retaliated with a thrown knife that slipped beneath his armour and buried itself in his belly. Then the poison took hold. Arrigal screamed — red veins crawling across his skin, bleeding from eyes and ears — and tried desperately to reload. He missed. The spasms threw off his aim. Barely conscious, he turned to flee — and Fëanon's lingering psychic agony caught up to him. He dropped sixty feet to the ground, unconscious.

Van Richten's armoured war tiger bounded into the square, crushing a zombie beneath its weight. The old vampire hunter loosed crossbow bolts from a nearby rooftop, rarely finding a mark — his age showing.

In the darkness, Tark activated his blindfold's truesight and saw the magical cord connecting Gowain to his remaining shadow monk. He launched himself at Gowain, grappled him into an arm bar, and with a snap of finely honed muscles and dexterous fingers, tore the ring from Gowain's hand — and swallowed it.

The shadow monk froze mid-strike, shaking. Buumi healed Gundren. Gundren propped himself on a crate and put shots into Gowain. Kenga disengaged from Gwen and marched toward the main group, not noticing Patches sneaking up behind him. She fell on the vampire cleric with a flurry — her dagger slipping between the plates to sting him. He caught himself before her trip could bring him down and spun, spitting curses.

Gowain pinned Tark to the ground and drew his sickle blade, cackling as he began to cut into the halfling's belly. Tark squirmed at the last instant, turning a gutting into a gash. Patches rushed in, kneed Gowain in the ribs, and rolled him off. Barely conscious, Gowain shadowstepped toward the alley to reach Kenga. Tark followed, clinging to his coat, and double-kicked him back into the street as the burning ring in his belly finally dragged him under. The last thing he saw was Ireena rushing to his side with a healing potion.

## The Count

Gowain lay in the mud, reaching toward the sky with a trembling hand, calling to his master.

The world went dark for one heartbeat. Then every shadow in Vallaki rushed to a single point before the fallen monk. Strahd Von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia, stood looking down at Gowain. Two figures flanked him: a massive eight-foot vampire in black plate mail covered in skulls, wielding a monstrous obsidian-headed axe, and an elegant bronze-skinned elf in filigreed leather armour with a jewelled scimitar at his hip. The elf — Rahadin — appeared beside Patches and gently touched her shoulder, healing her wounds with a flash of magic. He then moved to each party member, offering the same. Kenga fell to one knee before his lord.

Strahd conveyed his disappointment in Gowain with cold precision. After centuries of hunting adventurers, now — when he met a band he could not crush — he dared call for aid? Tired of the Mad Dog of Barovia, Strahd reached forward. A lance of energy erupted from his hand and disintegrated Gowain where he lay.

Tark sat up groggily. "I did most of that," he remarked.

Strahd chuckled and made a beckoning gesture. The ring in Tark's belly began pulling toward the vampire lord, dragging the halfling across the cobblestones. Tark stubbornly refused to give it up until Strahd, with honeyed words and the irresistible command of the Master of Barovia, compelled him to regurgitate it. Strahd crushed the ring into a molten orb of gold. As it shattered, wind whipped through Vallaki, the ground rumbled as if a far-distant structure had collapsed, and a hundred screams carried on the air. The zombies fell dead. The church fires began to dim. It started to rain.

Strahd turned toward the group — but Ireena strode from the alley, pistol in hand, and pressed the barrel against his chest. His eyes went wide. He stared at the face of the woman he had loved across centuries.

Crushed by the devastation around her, Ireena screamed at him — how could he condone this attack? Strahd's fangs grew slightly, his skin rippling, as he spoke of a lord who could not abide an enemy stronghold radicalising his peasants — though he admitted Gowain had taken things too far. He called her Tatyana. She screamed that she was not that woman. Patches tried to step between them but was ignored. Strahd's reply was quiet: *"Not yet."*

A crossbow bolt fired by Van Richten ripped through Strahd and struck Ireena in the throat.

Strahd caught her as she fell, panic on his ancient face. He looked to Rahadin. The elf murmured *"The Workshop"* — and in a surge of darkness, Strahd and Ireena vanished. The massive plate-clad vampire turned toward the rooftop where the shot came from and began marching, hurling aside tables and crates with contemptuous ease.

## Aftermath

Patches rifled through Gowain's dust pile, tried on his spell-wrought duster, decided it clashed with her piwafwi, and pocketed his enchanted kusarigama instead. Tark took the ring fragments. Fëanon found jewels and a platinum piece from Faerun on the dead vampire mage.

Rahadin addressed the group. Ireena would be cared for — his word as Chamberlain that she would not be harmed nor turned for at least forty-eight hours. At that time, a carriage would arrive wherever they were in the valley and bring them to Castle Ravenloft for dinner with his master, to discuss their "entrapment." He disappeared in a surge of shadow.

Buumi turned on Cyrrus immediately, grabbing him by his shirt and hoisting him overhead. He accused Cyrrus of the Barovian patrol — the friendly fire that had haunted him since their first day. He pointed at Fëanon and accused him of murdering Victor. Fëanon shrugged. Buumi, exasperated, pointed at Patches and declared that the Drow appeared to be the most moral of the group after Tark and himself. Patches put her hand on Buumi's arm, looked into his eyes, and said quietly: *"Let it go."* He dropped Cyrrus. The warlock, guilty and defeated, promised to do better.

At the Bluewater Inn, they found scattered furniture, deep scratches on the walls, and Aurora licking several wounds. Urwen's wife lay on the bar, blood oozing from a torn throat. The wine casks had been a trick — vampires hidden inside, and Urwen had unknowingly brought one into his own home. He and Aurora had killed it, but not before his wife fell.

Buumi placed his hand on the dead woman's head and prayed. Behind Urwen, still on his knees, his wife coughed and sat up. Too exhausted to stand, Buumi collapsed into a chair and took a pull of whiskey. Urwen, beyond words, rushed to his family. When he could speak again, he offered the group free room and board and told them of a family treasure in the attic. Patches found an ornate chest among hundreds of roosting ravens — a pile of platinum and gold. She took half. Seven thousand gold pieces.

## Confessions and Justice

Fëanon searched the battlefield for Lady Wachter and found no sign of her. He warned the guards that a necromancer might capitalise on the dead.

Chekhov and Mr. Pickles had found the stolen bones of St. Andral. The coffin-maker Henrik had paid a boy named Milivoj to steal them, then killed the boy to silence him — they found the child's body by the smell. The group marched to the coffin-maker's shop the next morning. Fëanon blasted the door off its hinges. Henrik was frantically packing a travel bag and bolted for the back exit. Patches webbed him to the wall. Under Buumi's Zone of Truth, the man confessed everything — Gowain had forced him to build the barrels that smuggled the vampires into Vallaki, and Lady Wachter had planned the attack with Gowain, though Henrik did not know her exact role. Buumi drew his blade to execute him. Cyrrus was faster — an eldritch blast formed inside the man's skull and detonated.

Tark screamed that they had just killed a defenceless man. Buumi told his friend, quietly and with evident pain, about the rule of law and the greater good — Henrik was a murderer and a traitor. But he was not happy about what had to be done.

Before they left Vallaki, Cyrrus stopped the group. He told them that he had originally joined them to steal their teeth for his patron — and that the group would have been killed in the process. They shrugged it off, having killed the Tooth Fairy themselves. But Cyrrus mentioned another name: Marilith. Those with knowledge of the lower planes stared at him. A Greater Demon. As penance, he offered each of them a promise. Patches asked that he disguise himself on her command. Tark got a promise they would spar someday. Buumi made him swear to save every innocent he could.

## The Road to the Temple

The group commandeered Van Richten's carnival wagon, cleaned it with magic, summoned a ghostly horse to pull it, and set out west from Vallaki with their mounts, Chekhov, and Mr. Pickles in tow. Near the Vistani camp, a cloaked Dusk Elf named Kasimir flagged them down and asked for a ride. He was heading for the Amber Temple to find a way to resurrect his long-dead sister — once a suitor of Strahd, stoned to death by her own people for fear she was falling to vampirism. Her body now lay in the crypts of Castle Ravenloft.

As the wagon trundled south toward Tsolenka Pass, the wind sharpened and Kasimir's hood blew back, revealing the scars where his ears had been. Under prodding, he told them: after Patrina's death, Rahadin had come to the Dusk Elves in the night and murdered every female of the tribe, then mutilated Kasimir. The group sat in troubled silence — their only prior experience of Rahadin had been his healing touch after the battle.

In the back of the wagon, Fëanon spent hours in meditation before reaching Mordenkainen's dreaming mind. He found the Archmage in a grand cathedral with a round table and thirteen seats, surrounded by his children. Fëanon relayed their story — Kangaxx, the artifact shard, Barovia, Rahadin. Mordenkainen did not recognise the fragment but was intrigued. He confirmed that the Archmages of multiple worlds had sensed a great evil — Atropos — moving across the planes. He had come to Barovia to investigate and to destroy Strahd, whom he believed was an ally of Orcus. He asked the group to bring him the Journal of Strahd and return his scattered items. In exchange, he would teach Fëanon powerful spells. Fëanon agreed and woke in the rumbling wagon as it turned south toward the mountains.
