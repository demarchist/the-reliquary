The group continues downward at a steady pace until the artificial tunnels of the Elves and Thri-Kreen give way to a saurian structure

In a massive underground roadway, the group turns and is led by Ahmahd into The Saurian Facility.

The elves have been raiding it for supplies for some time and other than a large quantity of Nasnas - Simian brutes - There’s not much else to worry about.

The group looks at their size and relative stealth abilities and decide that there’s no real point in trying to hide from these creatures.

Those that can stealth, do, but everyone else walks openly and brazenly through the Sarian tunnels and beneath the flickering Sourcelight.

Ahmahd is astounded at the arrogance, and takes up the rear, stealthily so she can flee these fools when they are overrun.

Cirrus can feel the pull of Fawden and knows the general direction to go.

Blessedly, it seems that Wild Magic is lessened down here in the depths.

The group pushes forward and can occasionally hear movement and shouting echoing in the far distance.

The Nasnas know they are here and Ahmahd warns that they will likely try an ambush.

They come to a tunnel shaft and find a makeshift ladder of bones and hair, they descend the grisly thing and continue

After some time, Patches hears a commotion up ahead and moves in to investigate.

She comes across one of the more intact Saurian pieces of architecture - a gatehouse or similar and she can hear commotion within.

Moving up to the door, she peers inside and sees Ape-like creatures with pelts and clubs.  Pale skin and tiny beady eyes and oversized canines.

They are rushing around grabbing weapons and riling themselves up.  Patches looks around and realizes there’s over a dozen of the things, and from the sounds of it, many more are nearby.

She backs away quickly and warns the group just as the hairy beasts burst forth from the ruin and begin to rush down the tunnel toward them.

Having been made aware of the impending attack, the group reacts quickly, blocking the tunnel with ice and then burning the Nasnas with a sickening radiance.

A particularly large Nasnas manages to avoid the ice and spell, only for Gundren to shoot it dead.

The Nasnas try their best to get through the ice and die to the Sickening Radiance.

As this first batch falls, another group slips through a crack in the wall to attempt to flank.

They are met with fireballs and burned to death quickly.

JmJm rides Steeden through the Ethereal Plane to check beyond the crack, as the icewall still blocks the main entrance and he finds another horde of Nasnas rushing toward the battle.

With Gwen, JmJm rides from the Ethereal Plane and unleashes twin Lightning bolts, killing all but the toughest, which they then dispatch with weapons.

JmJm backs off as the horde still continues to rush forward but are bottlenecked again.

Eventually, and with over 50 dead, the nasnas get the picture and back off.

The Radiance and Ice wall end and the group moves in cautiously

Patches takes the lead and its all clear for a few hundred feet until a Rope bridge can be seen spanning a chasm.

A newly cut Rope bridge.

The Drow spots some Nasnas across the chasm and snipes them with her Crossbow as JmJm uses Steeden, rope and Gwen to retrieve the broken bridge.

As the group moves to cross the bridge, Patches sprints ahead like the invisible wind and slays the Nasnas waiting to cut the bridge while the group was in transit.

They all cross safely and Ahmahd admits that maybe she was wrong

They push forwards through the Saurian facility, coming across many Nasnas shrines - arrays of bone, hide and metal scavanged from the facility.

One in particular has a Machina device at its core, which Cirrus takes after Gundren identifies it as a motor of some kind.

They can hear the Nasnas on the periphery, avoiding the group and they begin to wonder when their next assault will occur.

The group comes to a large chamber and a dead end with a large and ancient Saurian door standing barricaded shut by the refuse of the Nasnas.

Before it is a Saurian Console.

The whole area is cluttered with bones, refuse and makeshift shrines.  

Whatever this place is, it seems to be important to the Nasnas clans.

Feanon checks the terminal and finds that the large door is to an elevator shaft going down many hundreds of feet.  The door is missing several pieces, one of which the group has (saurian motor).

Unwilling to look for the other pieces, JmJm decides to ferry everyone through the Ethereal Plane to bypass the door and drop people off at the bottom of the Shaft.

As he begins the process, the Nasnas clans begin their assault but are forstalled by a sickening radiance at the tunnel entrance.

The group rushes to ferry everyone, especially as they can hear the clans flanking down side tunnels to get around the Radiance.

Just as the first waves of the horde round the corner, JmJm re-appears and takes the last few people with him on his Ethereal Jaunt.

They descend the elevator shaft, seeing dark echoes of ancient shades and swirling energies of the spirit world, but arrive at the bottom unmolested.

Back in the Material plane, the group finds themselves safe from the Nasnas and in a far less traveled section of the Depths.

Looking around, its clear that they are in ancient mines

Dusty bones scatter the floor and when investigated, many turn out to be human.

Slaves of the Saurian Empire.

They ask Ahmahd the course and the Elf admits that she has never been down this deep, but knows the general way to go.  They are heading for the Disphotic Forest.

They keep heading down.

They do their best to stealth here, especially when they come across veins of corruption and signs of Alghouls. 

They note as well that Wild Magic is almost non existent this far beneath the surface.

Time stretches on and they trudge through the dusty, silent tunnels of the Mines.

They find many long defunct mine carts, tracks and ancient stonework to keep they place intact as well as a large vein of Sourcestone

The ore is glowing and they investigate

A strange gas seems to rise from it, glowing

They touch it and hear the screams of Fawden ripping through their minds as they sense the very life-force of Gaia and the ground shakes.

Stones fall from the ceiling, clattering to the rocky ground

The life force of Gaia can be *heard* but is discordant, corrupted, and worsening.

They recover from the experience and move forward.

The long dark tunnels stretch on, but unlike the lightless of sections of the underdark, the depths here are illuminated softly by flickering energies and glowing Sourcestone deposits.

After some time traveling, Patches tells the group she thinks they are being stalked and the group doubles back, finding a small room to hide in and hopefully lose their pursuers.

Wrapped in concealing magics they hide until they are confident they have lost or confounded their pursuers.

They keep trekking down.

After a few more hours, it seems they have left all signs of civilization behind them.  The mines are now natural tunnels, wet with condensation and hot.

Ahead, the tunnel thins considerably and forms into a large crack, no more than two feet across and descending at a steep 45 degree angle.

Gleaming Sourcestone pinpricks light the area with a smattering of tiny starlight

Water is flowing freely here in a torrent and a strong floral scent can be sensed.

The ground shudders beneath their feet again and Cirrus winces, sure that he can now hear the cries of Fawden.

They are close.

Feanon decides to scout the crack in gaseous form.

He reappears minutes later, saying there’s a way through and turns everyone into gas so they can easily traverse the fissure.

Minutes pass as they flow through as easily as the torrent of water

Suddenly, the fissure relents and the group finds themselves expelled in a waterfall hundreds of feet above the floor of…

Before them, a cavern larger than any they have seen extends far into the distance, lost to the fog and mist of the place and lit with a diffused blue-white light.

Great pillars of stone rise from the mists, rising to the ceiling high above and festooned in glowing veins of sourcestone

Flora and Fauna are abundant and diverse, with schools and arrays of floating jellyfish-like creatures of every sort flitting around.

The ground itself is coated in mosses, shell-fish like creatures, coral, anenomes and other unknowable flora

The waterfall disgorges itself into a plateau on a particularly large pillar, forming a small lake

The group floats down as mist before reconstituting on the banks of the beautiful waters, the waterfall mist raining down on them.

They are exhausted, having been traveling for over twelve hours.

Feanon tests the arcane waters and finds there to be *no *wild magic here.

He summons his magnificent mansion and strolls in, with many of the group close behind.

The camping contingent turns to survey the epic scene of subterranean cliffs and mountains contained within the crust of this world, all teeming with life…
