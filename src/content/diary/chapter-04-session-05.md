Riding the racing snail and the giant turtle, the group spotted a large settlement in the distance. Goblin Town was a sprawling collection of ramshackle abodes, dominated by four landmarks: a set of docks, a large decrepit tower, a massive green-glowing cauldron with a structure built around it, and a huge mushroom housing an inn.

## The Docks and the Stocks

Taking a civilised approach, the group sidled up to the docks and found a goblin fishing. He explained that everything in Goblin Town worked on the barter system and gifted them fishing rods so they could pull junk from the bog to trade. Buumi refused the rod, electing to keep watch and take the measure of the townsfolk. The others fished up a ring of jumping, a cursed longsword, a rhomboid crystal, a brass cube, and miscellaneous trinkets.

Passing through the centre of town, they spotted a woman locked in the stocks. It was Lorde — JmJm's bardic rival. She was no mere performer. Lorde revealed she was a Harper agent, sent to stop the Goblin King from consuming JmJm's mind and using his body to escape into the prime material plane. JmJm had already been taken into the labyrinth. Lorde's mount, a purple war-tiger, was being held behind the ruined tower. The group decided that freeing her in the middle of town would provoke the goblins, so they promised to return for her and moved on. As they left, Lorde mentioned she had heard of a celestial mount somewhere south of town.

## Goblin Commerce

At the cauldron, the group found they could buy Goblin Bog Brew — a potent healing draught — for crystals. A cat-creature named Kazoo, strikingly similar to Doctor Breakfast, served as bouncer for the shop and told the group to piss off. After some back and forth, it became clear the two might know each other, and they agreed to meet at the inn later.

At the junk shop tower, a long line of goblins waited to sell their wares. Tark, impatient, eavesdropped on a mushroom shepherd complaining about a creature guarding the bridge that ate his livestock. Inside the shop, the group found a halfling named Steven — the original version of JmJm's goblin butler, before the demiplane had twisted him. Steven gave them a discount on account of their being friends, and they walked away with crystals, spell scrolls, and giant chicken mounts, including a handsome blue rooster.

## The Celestial Tiger

Buumi, meanwhile, pushed through moss and overgrowth behind the tower searching for Lorde's mount. He found a massive purple war-tiger lounging by a small pool. When he approached, the tiger grabbed him and pressed him into its chest fur while it drank. More importantly, the celestial creature's presence healed Buumi's Bog curse — his hunched spine straightened, the deformity fading in the tiger's aura. He convinced Borealis to join the group and guide them into the labyrinth.

The group gathered their mounts and headed for the mushroom inn. A long rest before the labyrinth seemed wise.
