**The Wyrmsmith**

​The group heads through the great set of brass doors, escorted by the Stoneguard and Flameguard.

They enter a massive cavern that turns slowly, hiding most of path from view beyond a couple of hundred feet.

As the heat intensifies and with sulfur heavy on the air, the group walks for a good ten minutes through the carved cavern

Eventually, they round the last bend and before them they see the largest pile of gold and treasure any of them have ever witnessed, atop which lies the fat **Red Dragon Themberchaud**.

Lava can be seen dribbling from volcanic vents with small glowing lizards shifting and moving around in the intense heat - Salamanders.

The dragon speaks at their approach, chuckling as it jokes to its minion about eating the party.

The jokes stop quickly as he appraises the group and his tone turns to one of curiosity.

**Legran** an Anvilthew recounts the events that led the group here to the Dragon.

Thinking quickly, Patches begins to say that she doesn't think the Dragon is powerful enough to destroy the Mummy heart, and Cirrus plays off this saying that he clearly is!

With a shout, **Thember** demands the Amber egg be placed before him so he can show his power.

A stoneguard rushes forward and places it before the dragon and then rushes away as the Dragon waddles up to it.

The torrent of flame breathed forth starts as a messy deluge, but Thember controls the gout and focuses it down to an almost coherent beam of blue flame.

As the breath continues on for several seconds, the stone turns molten around the Amber as the unholy artifact shatters and explodes, a whirlwind of dark sand engulfing the area as a skeletal face screams in the twisting dust.  

It dissipates quickly, leaving Thember blinking in surprise.

Turning to Legran, Thember says that whatever debt the group owes, he shall take on himself.

The Duergar are shocked but do not protest.  

Legran and the Stoneguard are dismissed and Legran re-welcomes the group back to the smithing complex for further business now that the Mummy has been cleared up.

Thember turns to his handlers and servants - the Flameguard, and dismisses them too, wanting time to speak with the group in private - even calling out several invisible Duergar to leave as well.

Now alone with the group, Thember shifts down to a form more comfortable for a discussion, taking on the form of a massive Duergar.

8ft tall, obese and with a long black beard ending glowing embers, the red and gold robed form of the dragon walks over to a setup of ornate furniture, decorated and filigreed NOT in the Duergar fashion.

On the table is a massive spread of food and drink and the group is welcomed to partake and join Thember.

The discussion begins with the group recounting their tale to the Dragon - Tark taking the lead.

At one point, Tark takes the axe the Mummy Lord had stolen from the group and tosses it to Snorbul, replacing the makeshift weapon he had before.

Snorbul is astounded at the powerful and ancient weapon.

Thember growls with hunger, seeing the weapon, but restrains himself.

Convinced of the groups power, Thember offers them a deal to resolve any lingering debt with him and provide an avenue for easy movement around the city - The Dragon has the Flameguard give the group golden badges denoting them as personal servants of the Dragon.

In exchange, the group is to find out what became of the previous Wyrmsmiths, the dragons before Themberchaud.  He is beginning to worry that he will be killed by the Duergar and wishes the group, as outsiders with no loyalties in the city, to do some digging.

Additionally, if the Flameguard have a task for the group, he asks them to do it and report back to him.

As they are talking, one thing jumps out that the group has to ask about - Thember mentions the "Fiery Bitch" currently residing in Overlake Hold.  An Archdevil that arrived at the city a few weeks back and has been pushing to augment the city guard with Devils.

The group agrees and as they leave the audience, Thember asks one last thing of Fey'Anon.  He wishes to learn wizardry from the elf.  Fey agrees.

Leaving the chambers of the Dragon, they are met by **Gartokkar of the Flameguard**.  The racist Duergar is incensed that a group of foreigners have golden badges.

He practically demands that the group do something for him and his organization - hunt down the Derro Droki and bring him in for questioning.  He does not elaborate.

The group then takes a rickshaw, trying to make good time through the city to pick up Snorbul some clothes and then head to their Dinner at the Shattered Spire.

**Traversing the City**

**​**Heading through the nicer side of the city, the Rickshaw, pulled by Derro, heads past the hold of the Deep King.

Passing the ornate black Granite fortress trimmed in gold, the group notes it bristling with guards - seen and unseen.

Out front of the palace, a large plaza extends almost to the great chasm of Ladueger's Furrow and at the center of the plaza is a massive 30ft tall humanoid, covered in a massive white silk tarp.

The newest Adamantine Golem of the city, awaiting activation.

The Derro driver tells the group that the Lairds of the city are squabbling over who gets the honor to sacrifice a set of twins (very rare) for their souls to fuel the construct.

Noting that the crazed Derro seems to know some stuff, Cirrus asks if there have been any deaths in the Derro section of the city involving missing teeth in an area of Iron bars and dirty scrap filled caverns.

The Derro says that there's death there in droves, and he must be talking about the West Cleft, and the old prison - now one of the Derro Ghettos.

The Whorlstone caverns are mentioned as a possible place Droki could be - the great cave complex, filled with Faerzress beneath the city.

Cirrus shifts his form to look like the Derro he saw in his vision from long ago, the Warlock he is chasing.  He is not recognized.

Cirrus knows the Warlocks of Ceregorach are around though, but he feels two pulses in the back of his mind...not one.

The group asks about Droki and they get a little more information, though vague.  The Derro apparently moves back and forth between the West Cleft and the Blade Bazaar. 

They find out though that he's shifty, exhibiting strange powers, even for a Derro.

Before long, the group makes it back to the Darklake district and they stop by a fancy Duergar run clothing store, picking up a dress military uniform for Snorbul - all black silk and silver buttons.

As Snorbul is getting outfitted, Patches feels uneasy and looks around.  Though she does not see anything, she feels that they are being watched and asks Tark and Cirrus to keep an eye out.

One other thing the group notes in the market - a group of three Bearded Devils, apparently on patrol.

Taking the Rickshaws, the group continues through the city, heading along the Docks to the Shattered Spire.

As they pass the abandoned area from earlier in the day (Hemeth's ship now gone), they see a lone Duergar at the end of a small pier.

Suddenly two Duergar become visible, knifing the Duergar on the pier brutally with blades of glowing force energy and they begin to struggle.

Seeing the conflict, the group rushes to intervene, Tark shadowstepping into the fray.

The group hits the attackers with some brutal attacks and manage to drive them off quickly (going invisible), saving the life of the attacked Dwarf.

In payment, the Duergar - **Werz an Saltbaron **gives the group a pouch of four large gemstones, Patches takes them but feels a slight buzz from them.

Werz is furious and thinks his trading partner sent the killers.  He asks the group to bring him the head of the **Snirfneblin Kazzook from Blingdenstone**.

Tark is aghast and protests.  As the group takes their leave though, Patches winks at Werz, indicating they might actually do the job.

The group heads back to the waiting Rickshaws and get in.  As they do though, Patches spots movement on the nearby rooftop and spots a Drow scout ducking into cover.  

She tells the group and the Rickshaw trundles the last stretch to the massive feast hall, fighting pit and tavern that is The Shattered Spire.

**The Shattered Spire**

**​**They leave the Rickshaws and begin crossing the massive wooden rope bridge connecting the Shattered Spire to the city.

The bridge is massive, easily large enough for the Stone Giants of the city to cross.

The area is a bustle of activity as patrons come and go.

Oddly for a tavern, there is no music, only the constant thrum of conversation.

Entering the massive establishment, the group sees that the first two floors of the place are scaled up massively, clearly large enough for the Giants to spend time here, after that though, the next three floors go back to a regular scale.

The whole thing appears to be serviced by a complex system of dumbwaiters.  Good food and drink being dispatched with efficiency and speed.

Across the main floor of the common area, a massive set of wooden double doors swings open as patrons leave and the group can hear the raucous cheers of the fighting pits.

The group heads to the nearest bar, slapping down 90g for everyone and to keep the food and drink flowing for the night.  

Morgran the barkeep in this section grins and takes the money, assuring them a good evening.

The group takes a quick detour to the fighting pits to check them out, witnessing an Orc and Goblin team fighting an Umber Hulk as the crowd cheers them on.

As they decide to head up to the third floor to look for Chadle and Hemeth, a Drow approaches them.

The scout from outside, her job done, has decided to approach the group as see if they can make a deal, worrying she would be hunted down after Patches spotted her.

They find out that **Ilvara Mizzrym** (the high priestess of Velkynvelve) paid the Drow scout - **Xalith**, to report the party to her.  She did and Ilvara now knows they are in the city.

**Xalith **as a Drow commoner is now looking for her next job and offers her services to the group but will not go directly against a Priestess of Lolth.  

The group decide to come back and talk to her later and Xalith remaining by the fighting pits.

The group take their leave and head upstairs to find their other contacts.

They quickly find Chadle and Hemeth and sit with them, a large feast being brought out over the course of the evening.

Chadle and Hemeth note the Flameguard badges the group now wears, shocked to see that the group has risen in stature here so quickly.  

The group still pay Chadle for the papers he acquired.

They talk with Chadle, clearly a member of the **Grey Ghosts**, the thieves guild in town.

**Chadle** is awfully chatty, and the group realizes quickly that this is information that "they" want to get back to **Themberchaud: **The flameguard had a Dragon egg to replace Themberchaud, but it was stolen recently.  Previous Wyrmsmiths were killed by the city, specifically the Adamantine golems - each dragon helping to finish one for the city before them being used to kill the dragon.  They create their own murder weapons.

Chadle takes his leave, smiling at the group and hoping they come to him and his friends with any further business.

Hemeth remains and mentions that he has asked around a bit about the possibility of stealing a Golem in the city.  

He has a lead that Clan Steelshadow is finishing an order for an unknown benefactor, and order of two Golems.  

They are currently not active and awaiting delivery.  He is trying to find out where.

Hemeth leaves as the hours draw on.

Patches begins to get a little impatient.  She asked almost an hour ago if her contact was here in the Shattered Spire.  She finally gets a note passed to her reading "prep your friends please".

Moments later, a grinning Duergar, almost clean shaven and with his distinctly non-duergar styled clothes approaches the group.

They recognize him but cannot quite place the face, until Patches greets Veygar - her one time kidnapper beneath the Troll Hills of Baldur's Gate.

Veygar is their contact down here for Lady Faye.  It appears after the botched kidnapping job, they went into business together.

Veygar sits with them and talks about what was found - ancient ruins depicting another fragment of The Last Word.  

He has lost contact with his crew out in the Underdark, and with all that's going on right now (demons), he refuses to go check it out himself.

He laments his lack of a crew currently and the group offers up Hemeth as a new crew member. Veygar is intrigued and decides to take Hemeth under his wing.

The group asks him about the stolen **Dragon egg**, disturbances in the **West Cleft** (confirming strange goings on there) and ask for any news about **Faen Tlabar** trading operations in the area.

Veygar raises a large mug of lager to the group.  To let bygones be bygones and to their current and future business dealings!
