Thunder crashes and lightning illuminates the edge of New Daggerford.

The dark forest sways in the howling wind, the rain driving and chilling the party to the bone.

In the center of town though, a bright radiance illuminates the town square as the Seraphim notches silver arrows to its bow and lets fly.

Piscine monsters are lanced by celestial arrows and slain as they attempt to abduct the citizens of the Barony.

The group sees the monsters further afield in the flashing lightning, dragging their prey in the direction of the lake.

Tark turns and leaps into the air, shadowstepping up the castle wall in a series of bounds.

Making it to the copper roof of the wall and looking down, the village is hardly visible through the rain, the keep has no idea they are under attack.

Tark leaps off the wall and races toward the Manufactory.

Silhouetted in the massive doorway is the Fire Giant Surtr, strapping on his armor and looking out into the rain, concerned.

Tark tells him of the attack and the Giant nods, it confirms his feelings of unease.

The Rockseekers grab telescoped rifles and head to the keep to meet up with the small garrison.

Surtr offers Tark a lift back to the town and extends his smoking hammer for Tark to hop on as rain hisses against its metal.

Surtr then hurls the hammer through the air, sending it arcing over the keep wall and toward the town far below.

Tark remembers that he still needs to alert the paladins and shadowsteps back, surprising Surtr who just chuckles and then disappears in a fiery burst.

Tark continues on to the temple of Helm and warns the few clerics and trainee paladins.

They grab their gear and rush from the Tower to join the assembly of forces in the courtyard.

Tark does not wait for them and instead shadowsteps atop the wall and leaps off, returning quickly to the group below…


The Storm rages and the monsters are cut down in the village square.

JmJm pokes his head out of his Theater, crinkling his nose at the spectacle.

He locks eyes with Feanon and then closes the door.

Fea cries out a curse at the Bard before the door flies wide, having been kicked open from the inside.

JmJm strides out, declaring that he will stand alone against the hordes, defending Over the Moon!

A flaming hammer descends over the town like a falling meteorite.

Just as it is about 20ft from the ground, a fiery explosion appears around the descending hammer and Surtr appears, catching the hammer and landing with a thunderous boom.

The group is suitably impressed.  A minute or two later, Tark re-appears and the group follows Feanon in the direction of his tower and the captured villagers.

From the north, two Dragonborn knights ride into town, lancing nearby enemies with Snorbul and Thorna trailing behind.

The Dragonborn report that Doc B, Jin, Gneiss, Chani and the other knights are in Kossenberg, defending the town from raiding parties, they are gathering the civilians and will then march them south to take refuge in the keep.

Snorbul and Thorna join up with the crew, but Thorna is semi-comatose, staring up at the rumbling stormy sky.

The Knights ride off to meet up with JmJm to escort the civilians from Over the Moon up to the keep

The group with Surtr press onwards to rescue those that have been taken by the Sovereignty raiding party.

As the group nears the outskirts of town, the forest looms ominously through the raining night.

The group closes in on the trailing enemy, seeing five civilians being dragged by the fish-like creatures through the raging storm.

Thunder rumbles and the rain pelts and four columns of lightning descend from the heavens into the forest, illuminating it in blue and white.

The four columns are then redirected from the forest by four hulking figures, illuminated by the energy and as large as the trees themselves:  Storm Giants.

The lightning blasts out, causing everyone to dive aside or be fried.

Burned by the lightning, the group rushes into combat, intent on freeing their captured people above all other objectives.

Tark rushes forward, pummeling two Sea Spawn who are surprisingly more resilient than expected.

An acidic Barb flies through the night from the hidden Aboleth Skum waiting for the group.

Tark catches  it and stabs it into the creature he’s fighting, but gets some acid burns.

Feanon casts Hypnotic Pattern over the next batch of prisoners and Sea Spawn, charming the batch and causing them to stumble to a stop.

Another acid barb flies out from another hidden Skum, forcing Feanon to throw up a shield.

Gundren summons the Tenser’s Disk for Gwen and Arkto for himself and hops on, quickly becoming air-support as the Dwarf begins to unload into the enemy.

Buumi flies forward on his summoned wings as Patches summons eclipse and the two of them rescue the last two prisoners, sending the lot running back into town, toward the Tavern.

Snorbul rushes up to join the fray, hacking at Sea Spawn and Skum.

Surtr lets out a battle cry and charges forward into the forest outskirts, making a bee-line for the Storm Giants.

As he nears, the illumination from his flames casting through the trees reveals the Storm Giants in all their mutated and malformed glory.

The once proud Storm Giants now have scaly skin, tentacles protruding from their face and gills across their chest.

Surtr charges two of them, and they seem more than eager to oblige, hurling blasts of lightning and rushing in with great stone weapons.

The Seraphim fires its remaining shots, striking and killing two of the raiders and causing a wash of celestial energy to flow from the arrows, healing Buumi and Snorbul who nhad been burned by lightning.

The Seraphim then disappears in a wash of moonlight and a voice booms in the heads of all nearby, swearing destruction against the enemy of the party.

The battle rages.

One of the prisoners turns out to be Fuega, Patches bouncer who was taken from her bed.

Injured, the Gnome stumbles to her feet before Patches hands her a healing potion, stabilizing the Gnome.

Now free, the small gnome hurls a fireball at the giants and then retreats, throwing Firebolts  as she goes.

Buumi and Patches see the Skum firing Acidic barbs from the trees, as well as the fourth giant still calling lightning down and the two of them rush in under covering fire from Gundren while Tark, Surtr, Fea, Cirrus and Snorbul mop up the Sea-spawn and turn their attention on the three other mutated Storm Giants.

The group takes a serious  beating from the giants, but their power overwhelms the Sovereignty minions and the Storm Giants are slain.

Everyone took a beating and more than a few sideways glances of displeasure are thrown at Feanon for bringing this down on them.

Feanon is not surprised when he gets a message from Giuseppe back at his tower.

The Gnome wizard reports an attack on the tower; a mutated giant supported by Sea-Spawn smashed through the front doors.

Giuseppe, Beryan and Uira repelled the invaders with assistance from the tower’s defenses, but Uira was taken by the Giant and dragged toward the lake.

The party heals up as Fea begins a teleportation circle, desperate to get to the tower and ensure the safety of the Sarcophagus.


Cirrus veers off from the party, as they crowd around the Teleportation circle.

 Surtr says he will continue on to the lake and leaves the group behind.

Everyone else teleports to Fea’s tower and island.

Gundren immediately takes to the air on Arkto and begins to circle the island, looking for targets through the storm.

Feanon hands out security badges to the group and then rushes from the Teleportation chamber...and immediately falls unconscious.

Patches catches up, looking down at the security badge she took from Feanon and pocketing it as she approaches and then wakes up the slumbering wizard.

Confused, Feanon goes back and grabs another Security key.

Patches keeps one undetected.

The group descends in the elevator to the main lobby, everyone awkwardly standing close and more than a little annoyed with Feanon.

In the lobby, the place has suffered some significant damage.

The main glass door has been smashed inward, the stone frame cracked and broken wider.

Blasted corpses are strewn about the entryway, many unrecognizable as Sea-Spawn.

Giuseppe can be seen taking cover behind the front desk, a yew wand pointing at the blasted front doors.

Beryan stands at the top of the grand staircase, surveying the area with her staff at the ready.

Feanon gets a report: 

The tower was attacked by a single Giant and band of at least thirty minions, 

the Giant breached the door and grabbed Uira before they knew what was happening, 

The Giant retreated and then the minions attacked

They tried to flood in but got caught in the choke point and killed by the remaining wizards.

Gusieppe (Male Halfling) and Beryan (Female Sun Elf Sage) last saw Uira (Female Moon Elf Wizard) being taken toward the lake.

Feanon storms out of his tower, starting to get really pissed off.

High above, circling the tower, Gundren thinks he can see a shadow in the water off the docks of Feanons island.


Cirrus makes it to the Fane and looks around intently, he quickly finds signs of raiders.

Heading into the Fane cautiously, Cirrus searches  but cannot find Topsy and Turvey, the two Deep Gnome Were-Rat twins.

They’ve been taken by the Sovereignty.

Cirrus heads into his inner sanctum, prays to Selune and then casts Fly on himself and soars into the stormy night, to Feanons tower.


The group follows Feanon out the smashed door of his tower and down the stone steps of the pathway leading to the docks.

As they near, the storm lessens a little and out in the water, they see a massive shape in the water.

The group fans out and Fea walks forward to the front of the jetty.

In choppy dark waters of the lake is a massive form.

Twenty feet long and sinuous, with long cat-fish like tendrils and ancient looking armored plates covering its form, the fish-like Aboleth looks out from the water, a vertical row of red eyes staring out from beneath a coating of mucus with a toothy maw beneath.

Feanon step forward, raising his staff and calls out in a booming voice but as he does so, the Aboleth disappears.

The Waters of the lake surge forwards and sweep everyone but Snorbul and Patches into the lake!

Feanon splashes into the dark waters and opens his eyes.

Flashes of lightning illuminates a small force of Abolethic minions, simply waiting.

A massive form looms up from the depths, a Kraken that then reaches out its tendrils to ensnare and attack the party.

Gundren begins firing from up above as the group desperately swims to get back to the relative safety of shore.

Patches, who had managed to stay on dry land takes a perfect shot against one of the Skum, hitting it in the eye and killing it instantly.

Snorbul rushes forward, slashing at a tentacle as Tark attacks the one near him.

Feanon though is truly caught by the Kraken and the beast begins to retreat with its prey, swimming deeper into the lake.

Falling from the sky, Cirrus drops his concentration on his flight spell, splashing down into the lake and banishing the Kraken.

The massive sea creature vanishes in a crash of water and flash of cavitation.

Feanon rushes back to shore, now free of the tendrils and begins to climb out of the water but with the Aboleths minions in close pursuit..

From the depths, the Aboleth begins to swim up and Tark takes note, determined to slay the creature that has caused so many issues this night.

He swims deep into the lake and shadowsteps next to it, striking….nothing and dispelling the illusion.

Now deeper in the water and far away from his friends, Tark peers into the dark depths and activates Truesight from his blindfold.

He sees a single malformed Storm Giant lazily swimming up in their direction, and movement behind him in the deoths; The Kraken swimming back from the Plane of Water.

Feanon climbs up to the Jetti, Buumi grabs the wizard and pulls him the last few feet.

The minions in close pursuit  let out a series of stunning screeches, staggering the party, though Patches and Snorbul both get their shots in while Gundren continues his aerial barrage in the lulling storm.

Feanon however is stunned by the Deep Scions and grabbed.

The monsters drag Feanon back into the lake and begin to swim down.

As they do so, the Aboleth becomes visible and dashes through the cold waters.

It rushes toward the Wizard and engulfs him in the cloud of mutagenic mucous

Its tendrils then reach out to enslave Feanons Mind…
