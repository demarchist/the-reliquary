The group is at their table in the shattered spire

They begin chatting about what to do with **Ilvara Mizzrym** and **Xalith**, the scout that told Ilvara their whereabouts.

After some deliberation, they decide to try and lure Ilvara into a battle with **Themberchaud** 

They decide to pay Xalith for the whereabouts of Ilvara

Before heading out, they ask some nearby patrons about The Narzugon that has come to the city

The Devil has taken up residence in the Overlake Hold and is summoning minor Devils to bolster the cities defenses against the increasing Demon attacks.

Snorbul mentions being taken home again and the group agrees.  They will take him to Blingdenstone.  

-8 silver for drinks and the group enjoys the Darklake lagers. 

Done with their evening meal, the group decides to swing by the fighting pits to check them out. 

Tark flags down a servant and orders drinks.  He proceeds to drink 8 lagers, faking tipsyness (as he cannot get drunk)

Patches approaches Xalith, the Drow enjoying a buzz.

When it becomes apparent they are talking business, Xalith takes a potion, sobering up. 

Tark doesnt want to fight any animals, and heads over to the fight organizers to inquire about bouts.  

Talking with Xalith, Patches ends up hiring her: -10g for info on Ilvara, -5g for discretion, -1g for an appointment with Xalith in the morning for further jobs  

Tark signs up for the fighting pits - Fighting **Bolekk Barrison Del'Armgo and his retinue** in 2 days at "noon" -200g for the team battle.  

Done for the evening, the group decides to head back to **The Gholbrorn's Lair**. 

Gundren, who had left earlier than the others to get an early night (fixing Gwen being important) and spots the drow and some nobles moving in and out of their apartment complex in the Lair.  

Gundren enters their own townhouse and meets up with JmJm and Doc. 

JmJm decries the dreary nature of the city and that he had to resurrect one of the Duergar, costing the group their only large diamond.

Hours later, the rest of the group arrives back at the townhouse

They discuss what to do about the Drow hunting party in greater detail, realizing that a fight within the city would be a bad idea - they need to ambush, or lure Ilvara into battle.

With what they know about the goings on with the Dragon and Flameguard, they believe that they could get Themberchaud to assist in the battle.

Mr Pickles chats with Snorbul, the strange Goblin putting the Snirfneblin on edge - as Mr. Pickles does to most people. 

The smog outside the lair is pretty bad and is getting to people, a few coughing fits and the group decides to get some breathing masks!

Using the Assassin gas masks from Neverwinter as a base, Gundren intends to create some duplicates. 

Fey is lounging, but decides that the town house is too fixed, too material and doesnt change to his whim enough and casts Magnificent mansion

After Fey enters his spell-mansion, there's a knock on the door, the Duergar proprietor has come due to the magic use.

It turns out that excessive casting of magic is a finable offence without a license.

Annoyed, the group pays for the license and the Duergar leaves.  Damn Duergar! 
  

After a few hours of relaxation, Fey'Anon decides to go looking for the Aboleth he spoke with earlier, unable to pass up such an opportunity. 

Patches, feeling restless herself and wanting to take a closer look at the Drow compound goes with Fey, to the Wizard's annoyance - he wouldnt be able to stop her anyway...

The two of them head up to the final level of the Gholbrorn's Lair, to the fanciest apartments across from the Drow Compound.

Patches notes that there are four clearly visible Drow, and four others that are hiding, guarding their own compound.  Though it's hard to tell beneath their Piwafwi's she thinks she notes uniforms and cuts that designate each soldier to be from a different noble house.

Entering the abode where the Aboleth, **Panoptes**, is staying, they see a bizarre sight.

Half of the common room of this beautiful establishment is simply a wall of water, with shadowy humanoid figures within.

Fey approaches and touches the water, sending out a mental query.

An Abolethic Thrall - a mutated and mucus covered humanoid, swims from the "room" and steps out, onto solid ground.

Fey and the creature begin to converse mentally (the entire thing being over in moments to the onlooking Patches) 

The Aboleth (speaking through its puppet) is curious about the group and Fey is curious about learning Psionics. 

The Aboleth is unconvinced until mention the Word, given after the Aboleth mentioned that the Sovereignty is looking into fleeing this reality.

Fey says that he too considered fleeing, until he realized that Atropos would not stop at a single universe and that only The Last Word can stop it.

The Aboleth considers this, and tells Fey that it will speak with the others and be in contact with him.

The Thrall vomits a pearl, a Sending Stone, and then returns to the water.

Patches watches in disgust.
  

The group rests for the evening, avoiding the smog of the city within the Magnificent Mansion.

They awake lazily, and enjoy the massive buffet and other amenities within the pocket plane.

Before long though, the group decides to head out to The Shattered Spire for their meeting with Xalith, 

Cirrus wants to investigate the warlocks this day, but will take the detour to the Shattered Spire first.

On the way, they swing by the **Anvilthew manufactory** to drop off Gundren (disguised) to repair Gwen. 

As they enter the plaza, a massive pool of lava lights, and heats the area.

Many duergar are milling around, as well as several Stoneguard.

A commotion at the other end catches everyone's attention as a Stone Giant comes stumbling around a corner, roaring and clutching its head in agony.  

The Giant begins to smash all in its path, crushing several Duergar, flinging some into the lava pool.

The group rushes into battle, trying to save as many civilians as possible from the rampaging giant - the creature mutating before their very eyes.

The creature's face begins to split into two heads, horns and spines begin to sprout and the legs snap, bending backwards and the arms begin to twist and elongate into tendrils.

The giant somehow begins to look more and more like the Demon Lord Demogorgon.

The group pours attacks into the thing, finding it more resilient than they expected. 

Fey'Anon polymorphs the creature, feeling a powerful resistance to his magic, but the spell takes and the giant shrinks into the form of a Myconid Sprout.

Gundren swoops down on Arkto, the Owlbear and scoops the "giant" up, dropping it into the center of the lake of lava.

The sprout plops beneath the surface of the liquid magma, the surface then erupting as the Giant regains it's form, flailing and roaring as the Magma burns it horribly.

The creature flings handfuls of lava at the group, hitting and burning them badly and then charges from the lake of fire, slamming into and past the group as the burning material falls from its horribly scarred body.

The group tears into the beast as it passes, its wounds looking horrible and the motions becoming more and more lethargic as they take a horrible toll.

The thing crashes into the wall past Fey and Cirrus, trying to get at the spellcasters.

Not wanting to take any chances, Fey casts Finger of Death and the necrotic energy smashes into the dying creature, dessicating the massive form and finally killing it. 

The body falls to the ground, smoldering from the lava, its body shriveling in places from the Necrotic spell.  

The Giant is dead and the area is in chaos.

Duergar Stoneguard tentatively approach and the clomping of dozens of boots can be heard as reinforcements are mere moments away...
