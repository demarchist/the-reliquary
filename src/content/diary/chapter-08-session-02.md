**Neverwinter**

**​**JmJm, Doc.B, Gneiss and Chani are in the rooms provided for them by Lord Neverember.

Gneiss' Corpse is laid out on a stone slab and prepared for JmJm's spellcasting of Raise Dead.  Chani waits nearby, watching with Doc.B

Taking out the massive diamond provided by Buumi (and Patches) JmJm places the Diamond on the big mans chest and begins his spellcasting.

As the spell goes off, JmJm's vision darkens and the world seems to drop away, leaving him along with Gneiss, looking down at a glowing light under his hand.

Another hand comes over JmJm's from someone standing behind him and he hears a voice in his ear, one he has not heard in years: The purring, sultry tone of the goddess Sharess.

She thinks that bringing back Gneiss is a grand idea and that the man will be most useful.  With a surge of Divine power, the spell complete and JmJm's view of the world returns.

Beneath his hand, half of the diamonds mass crumbles to dust and Gneiss shudders and then sits up stiffly.

Chani rushes over and hugs the man, sobbing into his arms.  She looks up at JmJm and asks why he would help them.  He looks off wistfully.

Exhausted, Gneiss and JmJm take some time to relax.  

Meanwhile, Doc B gets a message from Fey'Anon, asking him to Windwalk to the Moonwood and pick up Mr. Pickles on the way (at the keep).

The little druid gives everyone some time to rest and then tells them of the summons.  They all gather their things, let the castle guard know where they are going and then go to leave.

Doc.B takes out a small vial of oddly shaped glass filled with storm water and uncorks it.  Taking a long drag off of his pipe, he blows it out over the vial and it creates a swirling cloud of smoke and steam as the water is consumed.  The clouds grow and swirl, taking up the room as Doc B continues to exhale.  As the last bit of breath leaves Doc, everyone in the room is swept up in the swirling wind and they begin to rush across the Sword Coast, the land passing beneath them in a blur.

Traveling as the wind 300 miles to the East, the breeze rushes through Thunder Bluff and the half constructed keep, picking up Mr. Pickles and continuing north, into the Moonwood.

Only a few hours after being cast, the spell deposits Doc B. JmJm, Mr. Pickles, Gneiss and Chani, directly behind the rest of the party as they look over the ruined Elven village, smoke still hazy and thick in the air.

Hearing the crunch of snow, the group overlooking the village spins and sees that their companions have arrived.

**Moondancer Village**

**​**As everyone settles back from the surprise of five people showing up (and Mr. Pickles swearing and grumpiness about not being warned), they turn back to the destroyed village and note some movement down below.

The three elves with them are not waiting and hop off the Tenser's Disc and begin running/limping down to their homes, grief obvious on their features.

The party follows save for Gundren who stays on the ridge with his Thundercannon to cover them.

The village is arrayed in a circular fashion, with buildings around a large central clearing.  The buildings surrounding the clearing are almost completely destroyed, many worked into massive trees that are now charred husks.  The clearing in the center of the village is in even worse shape.

Covering the clearing are hundreds of dismembered pieces of Elves. Moon, Drow, and other skin tones the group does not recognize. In the center of the clearing is a single head on a pike.  It appears to be moving.

The elves begin to walk through the clearing, occasionally stopping and wailing as they find "someone" they knew well.

Cirrus sends up his owl for a birdseye view of the carnage when the others point out they think they see a pattern in the carnage.  Sure enough, as the Owl looks down, Cirrus sees that the dismembered bodyparts are arrayed in a massive Web pattern, spiraling out from the Head in the center.

Tark rushes toward the center of the pattern, determined to take the head off the spike while JmJm and Cirrus lazily follow.  At the edge of the village, they see three Moon Elves making their way toward the group - Rangers.

As Tark gets close, he sees and hears that the head is rambling, screaming and moving around.  Covered in small spiders, the dismembered Elf head looks at Tark as he approaches and a wave of dark energy flows from it at the Halfling.

Tark screams, falling back as he begins to feel hundreds of small creatures burrowing beneath his skin.  He concentrates and gets his body under control, preventing the curse from taking further effect just as Cirrus rushes the last thirty feet to him and casts a Greater Restoration on him.

Everyone backs up from the head.  The three Moon Elf Rangers make it to the group, with one introducing herself as Menriel Boughrunner and addressing Patches as Alyah.

The other rangers move off to their surviving Kin while Menriel talks with the group.

She tells them that this village was a mix of free Drow and Moon Elves and other than the three survivors the group found, only four others survived the massacre by the Drow.

Shocked by the scale of the attack on the village, Patches begins to investigate the area and finds massive bladelike tracks in the earth.  The only thing she knows that would make tracks like this being a Retriever; a demonic spider-like construct.

Menriel points to the head on the spike and tells Alyah that its the head of Findaal's Wizardry teacher and that this was most certainly targeted toward Finn, though they do not blame Patches or her Son.

Gundren walks down from the ridge to join the conversation and decides that he's had enough of the screaming cursed head and tries to shoot it, only for his gun to Jam.  He goes away to fix it before trying again and blowing it away.  

The head explodes, but the cursed ground remains, Buumi and Fey are unable to dispel or remove the cursed land.

Patches looks around the village, investigating for any valuables (on the sly) but finds that everything is either destroyed or has been taken.  The Drow raiders were very efficient.

Concerned about Oni infiltrators, Tark mentions how they saved the three elves they came across in the woods and wishes to escort the survivors and the Rangers back to their camp to ensure their safety.

Menriel agrees as the cave to the Underdark is north and the group would be traveling near their camp anyway.

They head away from the ruined, cursed village and travel two hours north, to a large Elven camp consisting of numerous igloos made out of the packed snow.

**Goodbye for Now**

**​**At the camp, the group enjoys a rest, even though the mood is quite dour.

Surrounded by Elven Rangers, all kin of those who died in the Moondancer Clan, the camp is quiet and subdued.

The group helps themselves to the stew bubbling over a large central fire and begin to discuss their next steps.

Doc B paces the perimeter for an our, searching for Oni with a spell but finds nothing.  He returns to the camp to relax, certain no Oni are nearby.

Buumi thinks that it is probably the best time for him to head back to the keep with Gneiss, Chani and Menriel (who expressed an interest in seeing the Barony).

Buumi says goodbye for now, hugging his friends and making them promise to call and collect him when they need him. He says the last year has been absolutely awful, but without one another, they would have all died a dozen times over.

The small group turns to leave and Tark rushes after Buumi, giving him another hug and saying Buumi is his best friend, to which the paladin tearfully replies that Tark is his.

Buumi, Gneiss, Chani and Menriel all walk off through the snow covered woods, heading south toward the Barony.

The group rests up, getting some much needed sleep and preparing for the Underdark.

JmJm begins to sing softly, playing his lute and telling the story of the group.  Over time, many of the elves begin to gather around the fire and listen to the Bard as the sun sets.

Patches begins prepping, knowing the horrible environment they will be traversing and gets out her bomb making kit.  Mr Pickles hands her a small chest of supplies saying its from "Abalaba" and are much needed supplies for the trip.

Fey meanwhile has found a quiet spot and gotten out the second golden scroll.  Studying it, he activates its runes and begins to read over the scroll.  He quickly confirms that it is another High-Magic ritual and recognizes a name mentions: Proctiv.  Wracking his brain as the name is familiar, Fey goes through his notes until he finds the passage he was looking for.  Proctive, Archmage of Netheril and known for the spell "Move Mountain" the spell that allowed the Netherese to rip mountains from the group and build their cities atop them.  Fey hides his excitement well, but his mind begins racing at the possibilities.

After resting, night has truly fallen and the snow covered forest is eerily silent.  The group takes their leave from the Elves and begins heading north, toward the spot Patches left the Underdark more than twenty years before.

**The Descent**

**​**Traveling through the snowy forest is easy enough, the group being quite experienced with winter travel by now.  They make quick time north.

While traveling, they hear a large crash and groan of wood.  Everyone continues save for Doc B, who stops to listen.

Hearing it again, the Druid recognizes the moan of a Treant and decides to investigate with JmJm.

The others realize that Doc has split off and wait, impatiently.

Doc walks through the trees for ten minutes until he sees the source of the sounds: A Treant.

The Treant though is doing its best to deal with a strange situation.  In a small dell with a winding stream mostly frozen over, the Treant stands above a pile of mush.  Occasionally, the pile moves and the Treant slams a fist down, splattering it.

Doc and JmJm move in to get a better look and realize that the mush is actually a Troll.  Every time its regeneration kicks in and begins to heal it, the Treant re-kills the thing, but with no fire or Acid, the Troll will always "survive".

As they look, they see one of the Troll's hands beginning to crawl away.

Doc B walks toward it, pulling his Scimitar from its sheath and enacting its magic.  It bursts into flames and the Druid touches the Scimitar to the crawling hand, burning it to a crisp.  Then approaching the main pile of Troll Gore, Doc communicates his intent to the Treant and it backs off, letting the Druid do what's necessary.  

Moments later, the Troll is burned and truly dead and the Treant is ambling off into the forest.  As it passed behind one tree, it appears hundreds of feet further on in the forest, stepping out from another tree, then it passes behind another and does the same.  Before long, the Treant has tree-hopped into the far distance.

JmJm and Doc follow their footprints back and rejoin the group and an impatient Patches.  They continue their journey north.

After another hour, Patches sees the small forested hillock that hides a dark passageway to the lightless Underdark.

Heading around to the north side, the group sees a small cliff face and within it, a sliver of a crack.  Patches points to it.  That's the entrance.

Patches takes a moment to list off three main rules of the Underdark: Be silent at all times, do not reveal any light and if they see something welcoming, it is a trap or already claimed.

Sighing and readying themselves for the journey, Tark mentions that it won't be so bad with JmJm's magical box. 

The bard grows quiet and then tells the group of its theft in Athkatla.  He's pretty sure that Shaahir was behind the theft.  Yet another reason for the group to despise the Archmage.

With nothing else for it, the group heads to the crack and begin to squeeze their way in, single file.

Barely large enough for them to fit through, they shimmy their way into the darkness, the cold wet stone against them. 

The light diminishes quickly and before long, everyone needs to rely on their limited Dark Vision painting the world in shades of grey.  Only Patches and Cirrus seem to be unphased, their superior sight giving them a huge advantage in the darkness.

The thin crack seems to go on forever.  Indeed, for at least two hours the group slowly moves through the thin tunnel, descending further and further into the cold earth.

Eventually, they make it to a small chamber, the crack depositing them into a space just large enough for three people and the tunnel continues.  This time though, the thin tunnel is close to the floor and requires everyone to belly crawl. 

For the next hour, they crawl in darkness, thousands of tons of stone pressing in overhead.  

If not for Patches guiding them and the fact they all have some level of Darkvision, panic attacks would be expected from such a descent.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, the group finally crawls into a larger tunnel.  Eons ago, water one channeled this larger tunnel from the rock, but it has long since dried up to merely a trickle.

Patches takes point with Tark and Gundren takes up the rear. They continue their trek into the Underdark.

Hours stretch on and the group continues to travel, each of them on alert.  As Patches points out what they are looking for; wedge shaped cuts in the stone denoting the route, the group assists in finding the correct path.

**Spores and Hulks**

**​**Turning down a left hand tunnel, the group continues a way until Patches notes something and signals for a stop.

Moving in to investigate, she sees a large fungal growth up one side of the damp limestone tunnel.

The rest of the group moves in close enough to see.

Doc takes a look at the growth but pulls back quickly as it puffs a spore cloud as he gets close.

Gundren and JmJm put on the Gas Masks they got from the assassins and move in to investigate.  They quickly discover a gruesome sight.

The fungal growth is from a humanoid body, the growth having erupted from the head and chest of a human prisoner and quickly grown to consume it.  As they search over the thing, it puffs out spore clouds and covers the two of them.

Finding nothing, they leave the body and growth and walk to catch up with the group that had moved down the tunnel slightly.

Gundren takes off the mask but begins to scratch at his skin.  Meanwhile, JmJm stops and stares for a moment at the Dwarf, thinking he saw movement around Gundren's collar.

Everyone regroups and they continue on.

Eventually, after sixteen hours of travel, the group risks exhaustion and they double back to a small chamber they found a few minutes ago. 

They begin to set up camp and Patches scouts the surrounding area.

As they begin to prepare for the rest, Tark notices Gundren scratching...and drawing blood.

Concerned, he calls over Doc and they begin to inspect the Dwarf.  As they do, JmJm calls out in a panic, swearing he just saw some kind of worm leave the self inflicted wound on Gundren.

A panic ensues.

Out on Patrol, Patches stops suddenly, hearing the commotion back at camp.  She then feels a slight vibration in the stone around her.  Adrenaline pumping, she rushes back to the camp to see the commotion of Gundren scratching maniacally and JmJm screaming about worms.  

The Drow hisses for them to be quiet, just as the wall explodes nearby and three massive Chitinous forms rush into the chamber...
