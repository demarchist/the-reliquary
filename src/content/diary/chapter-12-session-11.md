The group rests for only a short time in the Temple of Carthus

While there though, Feanon makes contact with the entity at the heart of the place.

An ancient hive-mind growing deep within this planet and a servant of the god Carthus.

Feanon learns that by coming here, to this font and attuning themselves, the temple above has been purified and is once again, concecrated

Gundren pours out the Horn of feasting as there’s no danger of wild magic in this sanctified space.

They feast and then pack up to head out.

Liara once again thanks the group profusely for getting her this far, a feat she knows her own friends could not have managed.

They take the dais back to the ground level

The place is now clear of corruption, leaving only stone, dust and bleached bones

The sun is setting and they have quite a lot of ground to cover to make it to the boat.

Cirrus leaps forward, his wings flapping as he takes flight.

As he goes, Buumi warns the Warlock that he makes a very tempting target flying like that.

Cirrus ignores him and flies onward

Until he’s hit by a thrown boulder.

Knocked from the sky, the Warlock almost hits the ground before catching himself

Off in the distance, three massive figures can barely be seen, though their booming laughter echoes across the badlands.

“LOOKS LIKE YOU HIT IT!” they bellow

Cirrus skates along the ground back to the group, unwilling to attract the attention ofthe giants.

Buumi aks Liara what kind of Giants they have here, she calls the Marid, which have elemental affinities.

The group makes it back to the cliffs in good time

Unwilling to free climb down, they have Cirrus fly a rope down and secure it at the bottom while Gundren secures it at the top

Tark releases the rope once everyone is safely down and then follows.

On the beach is a small campfire and Thirsty-Fingers is there waiting by the rowboat.

They hop in and begin to row out to the Fiery Flower

As Cirrus begins to swoop and fly around the rowboat, Liara warns the tiefling that his black feathered wings might mark him as an Ifrit, a being of the lower planes

After some discussion, Cirrus relents to hide his wings so as not to attract the wrong kind of attention, but he swears that he will bring the religion of Selune to this place.

 They get aboard the vessel and then begin to sail to the Pirates Cover to do the job they promised Lady Taurus.

The group charms the captain into dining with them

That night, they discuss their plans.

They will be dropped of on the shore as they approach the cove, allowing the Fiery Flower to return to Ras Alkan.

Thirsty will come with them as the sailing expert and the group will then hunt down the boat and discover the disposition of the Pirates that stole it.

They sail for most of the next day, nearing the Pirate cove in the afternoon.

They are rowed ashore and dropped off, Thirsty with an appropriate eye-patch and mustache disguise.

They hike in overland and through the dust2y badlands here.

As they near the location, the trail dips into the rock, creating a natural avenue down to the coast and a modest space containing the Pirate’s Cove

There are guards out front but the group bluffs and intimidates their way in (Snorbul flexed excessively)

They head into this small shanty-town esque freetown and find the place to be a veritable party of excess.

Fighting pits, gambling, whoring, drink, food and competitions abound and Buumi has to snap his eyes away from some fairly scandalous sights

They spread out searching the place for signs of the ship - The Royal Venture

Buumi arm wrestles someone, Tark plays Chance-cubes and there’s some high-stakes questioning before the ship is found down at the docks being re-fitted, the name in the process of getting re-painted.

They find out that the name of the captain of the ship is Drizzly Dawg

The group moves off to find a group of pirates that might know him.

They find one group that looks fairly disreputable and are pointed in the right direction.

As the group rendezvous at the docks, they decide to take a peaceful approach to this situation.

They’re going to ditch Lady Taurus and simply charter Drizzly and his new ship to take them to Iyum, the largest city in the area and ideally, their next destination (closer to other temples and the Ruby Dragon seen in the area).

Buumi has a moral objection to ignoring Lady Taurus’ quest and gets Liara to promise to compensate her when they get to Iyum.

Liara is reluctant to commit and Thirsty mentions that Lady T was no saint - she used the Royal Venture to Smuggle Serfs

Buumi relents a little and Cirrus approaches the ship, calling for Captain Drizzly Dawg

A dashing Elf with blonde locks and bronze skin comes to the railing.

A real Fabio-type

He looks down with interest at the group, his discerning eyes taking them in.

They talk for only a moment before the Captain offers them a spot on the trip to Iyum, a dangerous voyage.

They agree and the group ascends the gangplank to the newly christened ship, The Revenger (they tried to save as much gold lettering as they could…)
