In the ethereal plane, JmJm and Tark witness the swirling vortex of energies around Hohonu’s prison erupt as the Great Wyrm pulls itself from the pit.

“You hear a rushing sound, like an oncoming hurricane and look down toward the swirling vortex of souls. Erupting from the pit is a horrific, gargantuan form. It must be hundreds of feet long from horns to tail, with a set of four feathered wings, an axehead snout and covered in twisted cruel looking barbs and spines its dark glittering onyx body is threaded with gold. You note titan-forged chains around the arms and legs of the great Wyrm, sucking in all light around them in the Ethereal Plane and creating void-links that descend down into the Vortex. Hohonu’s dark eyes look down from above, the towering dragon opens its mouth and lets loose a deafening roar”

JmJm is terrified and turns Steden to flee the Ethereal Plane and return to the prime material.

Tark however, spots a small bright light, spiraling into the vortex and realizes that it is the soul of Camea.

He leaps from the horse and falls into the pit as the great dragon tries to strike at Tark, but the void chains restrain him.

JmJm flees, leaving Tark alone in the Ethereal Plane.

As he makes the transition, he sees a line of Necrichors and unleases a powerful blast of lightning from his ring, almost destroying them, which is then followed up by a blast from Cirrus, which does.

In the prime material Patches quickly slays the remaining halfling warriors.

The battle continues though as the Unliving Grand Shaman and hordes of Nechricors (tar/body amalgamations) surge from the pit, 

the Shaman casts spell after spell at the party

Hohonu in the Ethereal Plane begins to project his power through the weakened veil of this world, striking powerfully at the group even from within his prison.

The group pivots their attention to destroying the Altar and preventing the ritual from completing so they can retreat from the area

In the Ethereal Plane, Tark manages to grab the tangible soul of Camea and store it in a water-skin, but finds himself in a precarious and dangerous position so close to the Death Wyrm, swimming through the strange cloud of specters and consumed souls

Hohonu reaches out to Tark and a flood of corruption washes over the halfling, causing him to erupt in painful lesions, but his training purges the poison of it quickly.

Tark strikes back, hitting the Death Wyrm

In the Prime Material, JmJm tells his companions of Tark’s plight in the Ethereal Plane and scoops up Cirrus to return to help his friend.

Buumi and Patches both rush the Grand Shaman and attack him to stop him from making it back to the altar, but the small creature slips away, attacking Feanon.

Feanon ignores the Shaman

he and Gundren (flying high above, atop Arkto) manage to finally destroy the Altar to Hohonu and as it falls into the tar-pit, the Grand Shaman falls dead - the power conduit keeping him alive being severed.

Those who can make it to the Ethereal Plane make the transition, and see the Great Deathwyrm in all its splendor.

Hohonu reaches out into everyone’s minds, promising them something they deeply desire in exchange for his freedom, many of the group stop to consider it, but only for a moment.  None accept his offers.

Cirrus flies down into the vortex and grabs his friend, pulling him from the pit and back to Steden, who quickly retreats back to the Prime Material.

Patches lingers a moment though, lining up a shot with her long held Bolt of Dragon Slaying.

She fires and hits the Great Deathwyrm, lodging the bolt between scales at the base of its jaw.

Hohonu roars in pain and moves to lash out at his attacker, but Patches is already gone, fleeing back to the Prime Material.

Hohonu can reach them even there, and three blasts of shadow erupt from the tar pit, striking Patches, Tark and Gundren painfully.

The group takes a moment to catch their breath with the Nechricors and Halflings all slain and the ritual fouled.

They rush to the body of Camea and revive her with a diamond and the soul brought back by Tark.

Camera cries in pain, as her body is broken, but she is quickly healed.

She lays there, stunned to silence.

The pit still bubbles and Hohonu calls telepathically, threatening and promising bargains and lashing out at the group.

The group gathers Camea and the Dwarven Merchant that had been assisting them in the battle

Patches searches the corpse of the Grand Shaman, taking his obsidian dagger and finding a small book on the body, bound in leathers, but looking far fancier than anything she has seen from the Halflings thus far.

Thinking better than to stay where the Wyrm can strike at them, they retreat 500 yards away, near the mists of the Swamp to regroup and figure out their next course.

Camea is still in shock, having just died and almost been sacrificed to a dark god.  She stays quiet and rests.

Feanon informs them that he has a plan and mentions that Hohonu’s prison, whether the source, or it was build here for this reason; is a *powerful *leyline.

The group decide to try and use the Leyline of this place to reinforce an Antipathy spell which *should *keep most beings away from Hohonu for the time being.

It is not a permanent solution and the group mentions coming back with some Gold Dragons as allies to put this thing down properly.

Feanon wonders about using The Last Word to empower the spell, but thinks that it is still too risky to use.

He returns to the Pit and casts the spell 

Despite interference from the imprisoned Death Wyrm, who attempts and fails to counter it, manages to weave the powerful spell.

A permanent Antipathy spell now defends the area, and given enough time, the power of the sacrifices should attenuate, allowing the prison to become secure once more.

Feanon returns to the group, letting them know that it has been done 

They then leave through the mists with Camea leading.

They talk with Camea about what she wants from them and for her people.

The Shaman of the Old ways, still shaken from the ordeal, says that she cannot return to the village.  Her brother Ruru will take control and with Hohonu still around, she doubts she can wrest control from him. 

If the group was to return with her, it would be a fight that would lead to the deaths of many

Her goal was to stop the freeing of Hohonu, that has been achieved.

 She will return to her exiled people and decide with them if they should remain in the Swamp, or head to the Golden Tower (as offered by the party).

They make it to the other side of the mists 

Camea thanks the party for stopping the rise of Hohonu and saving her and says that she will remain in touch with the group with magic.

The group turns to leave the area, intent on putting as much distance between themselves and Hohonu as they can.

Camera disappears into the swamp, passing without a trace.

The group turns Southwest, intent on finding the Machina factory, and the way home…
