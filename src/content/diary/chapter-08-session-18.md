The group finds themselves standing over the corpse of the mutated giant, the remains smoldering from the lava immersion.

Investigating, Fey finds residual magics, the result of a powerful and targeted curse.

The Duergar Stoneguard survivors approach the group, noting the golden badges and thank them for their assistance.

The ground begins to rumble and moments later another Stone Giant, this one looking healthy, rushes into the large plaza

It sees the corpse and falls to its knees sobbing.  The giant - **Dorhun**, identifies the dead giant as its wife.

Stoneguard reinforcements arrive but stay back, noting that the action has subsided and allowing the newly arrived Giant some space.

**Dorhun** collects the corpse of his wife and is told by the group that she was targeted by a curse, someone did this to her.

**Dorhun **thanks the group for the information and bids them come to **Cairngorm Cavern to speak with Hgraam **their leader.

The giant then leaves and a Duergar Captain approaches.

The captain thanks the group and offers them mercenary work with the Stoneguard.

Cirrus politely states how much he hates the city of Gracksuluth and the group declines.

The guards begin to clean up the damage from the rampage.

The group heads into the Anvilthew manufactory to drop Gundren off to fix Gwen.

Gundren splits off from the group, heading into a workshop provided and begins to get to work with the help of Gil the intern, utilizing an Elemental powered forge.

The others of the group head to talk to Legran, to get some more information.

Patches finds out that her contact, **Claudine**, was lost in a contract to the **Muzgardt** clan a few years back, she works for them now but the **Anvilthew** want her back.

Patches wants to find Claudine due to her connections with Bregan D'Aerthe and potentially find a way into Menzoberranzan that's not so obvious.

The group is also told that Anvilthew will pay handsomely for any Purple Worm eggs, 7,500gp each if they end up going to The Wormwrithings.

Unsure what to do next, they ask **Legran** to leave his office so they can speak in private and he obliges.

The group then go on to agree that no one wants to remain in The Underdark any longer than they have to and that they should stay focused and not get bogged down in local affairs. 

They narrow down their goals and decide to head to **The West Cleft** first to find the Warlocks of **Ceregorach** for Cirrus, then visit the Giants (and their connection with **Gravenhollow**), talk with **Xalith** the Drow Scout and then wrap things up with **Themberchaud**.

They head out, Gundren staying behind to work on Gwen, the workshop and assistance making the work go far faster than expected.

Heading through the city, the group makes their way to Ladueger's Furrow and the complex series of elevators the Duergar use to traverse up and down the smog-filled chasm.

The descent takes the better part of two hours.

As they go, every now and then they stop to ask the locals if they have heard of any murders where the teeth are missing; people have.

Patches and Tark begin to feel uncomfortable as they descend further into the Furrow.

Tark feels that they are being watched and Patches thinks she sees someone following them.

They both inform one another and Tark decides to try and see who is following them, shadowstepping into some deep shadows and going invisible. 

Hanging back, Tark spots that the group is being followed by two Derro, Tark gets close but has a hard time hearing what they are saying, but does catch a few snippets.

He hears the name **Zhengyi**, the name of one of the Derro; **Rilka** and  and that the two Derro know that the group carries something important.

The group finally makes it to the entrance to The West Cleft and approach the large set of guarded doors leading to the Derro Ghetto. 

They chat with the guards at the checkpoint and are warned that the Derro have been agitated recently, and are prone to violence.  

They also confirm the murders and missing teeth.

Tark returns to the group, noting the location of the two Derro tailing them and asks the guards for assistance in apprehending them.

Listening to him due to the Flameguard badge he wears, the Guards rush to the spot indicated by Tark, but spook the trailing Derro - Dimension Dooring to safety.

Patches berates Tark for getting the loud guard involved rather than taking the two Derro themselves.

Heading back to the door to the Ghetto, they concoct a plan.

Cirrus will go in first, naked, covered in teeth and blood and try to intimidate the Derro with a show of insanity - he wants to be taken to the Warlocks!

He steps into the West Cleft, alone.

Cirrus approaches the nearest Derro, which takes note of him and sneers.

Cirrus wails "TAKE ME TO THE MASTER!", to which the Derro responds with "GET HIM BOYS!" before being blasted into bloody bits by a volley of blasts from Cirrus.

The nearest other Derro rush the naked Warlock and attack with wicked knives, but the group behind him takes action to assist subtly, paralyzing one and killing the other with a thrown blade to the neck

Cirrus is sprayed with blood and he takes his dagger, plunging it into the paralyzed Derro's mouth and trying to cut out as many teeth as possible.

The other Derro in the area that were coming to assist their brethren seems stunned by the show of brutality and power from the Warlock, who once again screams to be taken to the Master.

As another Derro is splattered across the ground, the intimidation finally gets to them and they back away from the crazed tiefling Warlock.

One Derro approaches Cirrus and after a quick conversation, leaves to contact the Derro Warlocks of the Tooth Fairy.

Cirrus waits nearby, covered in blood, and sits on a rock out of sight from the Duergar guards.

At this point, Patches has snuck in and is covering the Warlock with her Crossbow from the top of a nearby statue.

Tark has moved into the area as well with his Tark-Spidermen disguise and begun asking about **Rilka **and where he might find her.

Eventually, Cirrus' ploy pays off and he is approached by a strange looking Derro in patchwork clothing with a wide brimmed hat and carrying a leather messenger bag. 

He introduces himself as **Droki, **(who the flameguard are looking for).

Cirrus lays the intimidation on thick and cows the smaller and weaker Warlock into doing his bidding - he wants a meeting with Droki's master, **Bilrigger the Savant**.

They agree on a time and place - four hours at the **Hall of Sacred Scrolls**.

Droki is convinced to go with Cirrus and the group and so Cirrus calls up his tiny messenger and ushers Droki into the box, which he reluctantly enters after mentioning getting past the guards is always a pain.

The box then appears next to Fey'Anon, who does not open it, knowing its contents.

Patches sneaks back to the others and Cirrus appears a few minutes later, letting Droki out of the box behind the Duergar guards.

Meanwhile, Tark has found the hovel of **Rilka**, nothing more than a small cave, but the place gives him the creeps and a cold shiver runs down his spine.

Entering the abode, he spots three Vampire Derro drop from the ceiling and spread out.

He asks them questions about Rilka, and hears the name of her Derro Savant master - **Milgre**

The vampires can restrain themselves no longer and launch themselves at Tark as he tries to defend himself, using his staff to block bites and as leverage to snap necks.

The three vampires are tough though, and even with shattered bones they quickly regenerate.

the brawl turns into a deadly battle and the Monk is torn at by fang and claw, but he gives back twice as hard as he gets, finally managing to kill one of the Thralls.

With the explosion of ash and dust, only two of the Vampires remain and the tide turns in Tarks favor.

He dispatches the other two in short order.

Stumbling back to the group, bloody and pale, Tark wracks his head.  How do they keep running into agents of Orcus and Zhengyi.  No one knew they were in Gracksuluth.

Tark's blood runs cold as he realizes that's not true, one person knows, he told **Kenshi** in a dream the other night.

The group is shocked when Tark returns and Cirrus quickly prays to Selune (out of sight of Droki) to heal the worst of his injuries.

Tark tells the group what he's discovered and the others ask him if he had ever talked to Kenshi outside of the Dreamscape, seen him or talked to Gaddock recently.

Tark, now distraught says that he has not.

They need to get to the bottom of this and the group decides to head back to the Townhouse to meet up with Doc B to heal Tark and Scry on Kenshi - in case the old monk has been captured.

it takes some time, and Droki follows (in disguise) and they make it back to their abode with a few hours to spare before their meeting with **Bilrigger**

**Patches **heads to the Shattered Spire to meet with Xalith quickly and hires the Drow Scout to return to Menzoberranzan to collect information.

She asks for the general disposition of the noble houses within the city and general news on what is happening there.  Xalith agrees.

Doc B is shocked at the state of his friend and quickly heals the poor Halfling, closing his wounds and healing the necrotic damage of the vampire bites.

The group explains to their cat friend what they need and the questions needing answers and Doc grabs his Amethyst crying crystal and begins to cast the spell to check on Kenshi.

It fails.

Doc tries as hard as he can, but it appears that Kenshi does not exist, at least not on this plane of existence.

Panicked, Tark asks Doc to Scry on his adoptive father; Gaddock. 

This time the scrying works.

Peering into the crystal, Doc narrates what he sees - A dark and cold chamber, carved from ice and a single bed covered in plush furs.  In it lies a pale unmoving man, elderly but strong with thick hair silver and a full beard.

Tark turns to Cirrus, he NEEDS to speak with Gaddock immediately.

Tark sits and enters a meditative sleep and Cirrus enacts the spell.

Not bothering to form the dream into anything specific, Tark contacts the slumbering mind of Gaddock within the grey void of the Dreaming.

His old master greets him with sadness.

Tark asks what is happening, why he looks this way, why he has not heard from him, why they cannot find Kenshi and why they keep being attacked by agents of The Enemy.

**Gaddock** confirms Tark's fears: Kenshi does not exist, it is a front that Zhengyi has been using to keep track of the group, talking with Tark and getting him to tell the enemy important information.

He goes on to say that when he was "saved" from the dungeons, it was because of who he was to Tark.  He died, and was brought back as a Vampire by the Lich-king.

Tark is horrified and swears that he will save his old master, but the older man grabs Tark and insists that Tark should stay away, that he cannot be saved.

The only way to save him, is to beat Zhengyi and his masters.

With tears in his eyes, Tark agrees and bids his father figure farewell, ending the Dreaming.
