Floating above Tier Breche, Gromph finishes casting the ritual spell to summon the Demon Lords.

He teleports away as his contingency spell whisks him from potential danger.

Floating a hundred feet from the plaza, the singularity he had been forming, explodes.

Blasts of energy deposit massive forms across the Plaza, resolving into the 7 figures of the Demon Lords.

Demogorgon, Orcus, Baphomet, Yeenoghu, Zuggtmoy, Juiblex and Graz’zt

The singularity pulses with energy still as other demons are ripped from around the Underdark, depositing them into the battlefield.

As the Demons all begin to react to the new situation, they are all compelled by the spell to battle, to annihilate one another and ignore the surrounding city and surrounding armies.

Despite the overwhelming power of the ritual spell to compel them, Graz’zt and Zuggtmogy both manage to wade into the front ranks of Slave fodder, turning dozens to their will, to join them in battle against their fellow demons.

Behind the ranks of slaves, the Drow wait and watch.

The Priestesses weave protective magics against the abyssal energies of the demon lords, protecting the armies minds while abjurers create shields and walls of force to protect from collateral damage (flying rocks, magic etc.)

The Plaza quickly turns into an absolute bloodbath.

Baphomet goes down quickly, set upon by several foes, but he doesnt stop twitching before he consumes the ambient magic to resurrect.

As he does so, new magic rushes to fill the void.

Graz’zt seems intent to annoy the others and watch while they battle.

Zuggtmoy too seems to bide her time while Juiblex launches great arcing gobs of ooze across the battlefield.

Orcus and Demogorgon lock in combat, the Prince of Undeath summoning a small army of skeletons and mummies to assist him.

Demogorgon’s sheer size and power is enough to wade through them.

Yeenoghu and Baphomet continue to battle, Graz’zt seeing an opportunity and kills Baphomet again.

Zuggtmoy kills Yeenoghu, then Orcus manages to take down Demogorgon.

Each rise again moments later…

Across the city, a second ritual spell begins in the Clawrift, visible from across the city and felt by all within.  A section of the army is sent to investigate, breaking off from the rear.

Visibility begins to get tricky across the city as great clouds of gas begin to form.

The ambient magic of the Underdark is being consumed by the Demon Lords, so much so that the underdark itself is being drained of the cloying abyssal and wild magics that have been plaguing it.

As the Demon Lords do everything they can to maintain their physical forms, the lesser demons remain dead and indeed seem to be properly banished on death.

With the ambient magics being so thoroughly depleted, the barriers between the worlds begin to reform, no longer being eaten away at/pried open.

The greater demons begin to die and this time, they stay dead.

Baphomet falls again and this time does not rise.

Orcus, Zuggtmoy and Juiblex are the only demons still standing.

The Drow army preps to move in, commands begin to be called and the ranged forces of the army begin to take aim and prepare spells.

Across the city, the second ritual in the Clawrift seems to grow stronger a swirl of necromantic energies. 

great clouds of gas float through the city and a commotion at the back of the Drow army seems to be demon cultists attacking their flank.

Orcus falls to Juiblex, a laugh in his throat as he returns to his fortress of Thanatos.

Zuggtmoy wades in to battle against her most ancient foe - Juiblex.

Her surviving minions form a living barrier between the two lords, but are quickly dissolved by the Ooze Lord.

It gives the Queen of Decay enough time though to rip Juiblex apart.

Cackling with glee and bloodlust, Zuggtmoy’s tendrils continue to rip bodies apart.

The Drow army attacks.

Thousands of crossbows fire, dozens if not hundreds of evocation spells are launched from the wizards and great columns of flame are called down by clerics.

Zuggtmoy is destroyed.

The Demon Lords are finally, and truly banished.
