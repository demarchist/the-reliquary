The adventure began on the road south from Neverwinter. The party had been hired to escort a wagon of supplies to Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin on behalf of the dwarf brothers Rockseeker. Gundren Rockseeker himself had ridden ahead with Sildar Hallwinter — officially a hired guard, but in truth a Gauntlet Agent and a good friend of Gundren's.

## The Triboar Trail

Heading south along the Triboar Trail, the party came upon signs of a recent ambush. Before they could investigate, goblins burst from the underbrush and attacked. The party dispatched them all, with Jack Mayer Johnson Mathews managing to capture one alive for questioning.

The captured goblin led them to the Cragmaw Hideout. The party killed the goblin sentries outside, then crept into the cave system. Inside, they befriended a pack of chained wolves and pushed deeper, eventually locating a bugbear named Klarg who appeared to be running the operation.

The party split up to clear the hideout. One group assassinated a sentry and then stormed through the goblin-held chambers — noosing and mage-handing the goblin chief while Jedd took stab wounds in both legs. The other group arrived just in time to turn the tide.

## Sildar Rescued

Sildar was found alive and freed from captivity. Meanwhile, the party snuck down a chute to surprise Klarg from behind. Rather than fight, they charmed the bugbear and convinced him they were agents of the Black Spider — his boss. Klarg obligingly hauled his own loot out for them and even offered up a goblin slave for their trouble.

With Sildar safe, he shared what he knew: Gundren had been taken to Cragmaw Castle, though Sildar had no idea where it was. The dwarf had discovered the location of Wave Echo Cave, and that was why he'd been kidnapped.

## Arrival in Phandalin

The party arrived in Phandalin — a small frontier town of forty-odd buildings, raised on the bones of older ruins. Trouble was brewing: a gang called the Redbrand Ruffians had been terrorizing the townsfolk.

Sildar headed to the Stonehill Inn to rest and plan his search for his missing wizard friend, Iarno. He arranged a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester for later.

The party went to Barthen's Provisions and met Barthen, informing him his brother Gundren had been taken. Barthen offered 150 gold for Gundren's safe return and loaned the party his wagon and oxen. They then visited the Lionshield Coster, where Linene Greywind — a dealer in mining goods and provisions — agreed to pay them for returning goods stolen by the goblins.

At the Stonehill Inn, the party's bard played a set convincing enough to earn the group free room and board from the innkeeper, Toblen Stonehill. Over drinks, the party picked up various rumors, the most interesting being a halfling child's claim of having found a secret tunnel leading into the Redbrand hideout.

## Clearing the Redbrands

The party tracked down the halfling child, Carp Alderleaf, and followed his directions to a hidden passage into Tresendar Manor. Descending through a cavern beneath the manor, they fought and killed a Nothic lurking in the darkness.

Pushing deeper, they discovered rooms occupied by bandits and bugbears alike. They lured both groups into a corridor and unleashed a lightning blast from a scroll, cutting them down in one devastating strike. An unconscious goblin survivor proved too dim to know the location of either Wave Echo Cave or Cragmaw Castle.

In an alchemy chamber, the party looted everything they could carry — but a rat familiar escaped and alerted Glasstaff, the Redbrands' mage leader. They also found a book written in Dwarvish detailing the history and purpose of Wave Echo Cave, including mention of the mace Lightbringer, a weapon sacred to Lathander, lost somewhere within the cave.

The party found Glasstaff's quarters already abandoned, a secret passage standing open. They gave chase. Patches nailed Glasstaff in the knee with a critical sniper shot meant to cripple, and the group brought him down.

## The Unmasking

Glasstaff was Iarno — Sildar's missing friend. A former member of the Lords' Alliance, Iarno had been sent to Phandalin to establish a constabulary. Instead, he'd formed the Redbrand Ruffians to fleece the town. He'd been contacted by the Black Spider through noble connections in Neverwinter and signed on to serve the Drow agent.

The bugbears the Spider had sent to assist Iarno had known the way to Wave Echo Cave, but they were dead now. Iarno confirmed that the Black Spider was Drow, and was currently in the cave searching for the Spellforge. He claimed none of the other Lords knew of his betrayal — though the party had their doubts.

The party dragged Iarno and the unconscious goblin back through town toward the Townmaster's hall. On the way, a group of Redbrands returning to the hideout stumbled upon the procession. Seeing their boss in chains and hearing that all their companions had been slain, they wisely chose to flee.

The party handed Iarno over to the Townmaster, who took him into custody and sent word to Sildar. The party retired to the Stonehill Inn to rest, awaiting a meeting later that evening with Harbin Wester to discuss everything that had transpired.
