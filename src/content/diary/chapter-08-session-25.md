Gundren wraps up working on Gwen, reactivating the magnificent lion after Gil has left (much to the disappointment of the young Duergar).

The servos whir and pistons hiss.  Gwen gets to her feet, new adamantine plates gleaming in the forge light.

she plods over to a corner and sits with a clear line of sight on the door.

Gundren then settles in to work on copying the Gas masks.

it takes him several hours, but he succeeds in replicating everything (creating one extra mask) except for the lenses being able to see through non-magical smoke.

Settling back in his chair and smoking his pipe, he thinks it over for a while, taking a rest.

It comes to him as he's resting; Phase Spider Chitin might do the trick.

Gwen's mechanical parts whir, alerting Gundren and he looks to the open door to the smithy.

A young Surface Gnome stands there, wide eyed and then lets out a little yelp as Gundren notices him.

The Gnome dashes off.

Gundren commands Gwen to pursue and detain the Gnome and Gundren rushes off in hot pursuit.

Within seconds, the Gnome is on the ground, the mechanical lion keeping him pinned.

The Gnome babbles in fear.

A quick interrogation reveals that the Gnome; **Mimble** is an apprentice of an inventor named **Dr. Hojo Finklespark** (self proclaimed best inventor in the world).

Gwen was so magnificenct that Mimble was going to go and tell his master of her.

He doesnt elaborate on what would happen if that were to occur, but Gundren is suspicious.

Mimble realizes that the burly Dwarf might be closer to murder than he first thought and calls for help.

Gundren stuffs the gnome into his bag of holding and a few moments later, a Duergar guard comes around the corner to investigate the cry for help.

The guard looks around, seeing Gundren, Gwen and Mimbles dropped bag.

Gundren claims that its his, picks it up and turns to leave.

Suspicious the guard moves forward and calls for the Dwarf to halt.

Gundren does so, tense and ready to react in case of a fight.

The Duergar holds out a small gizmo that Gundren missed when picking up Mimbles bag.

Gundren lets out a small sigh of relief, takes it and leaves the area, though he can clearly hear an invisible Duergar guard in close pursuit.

Exiting the Anvilthew manufactory, Gundren quickly calls over a fully enclosed Rickshaw and is taken back to the townhouse, making sure to circulate the air in the bag for **Mimble** every few minutes.

Gundren arrives at The Gholbrorn's Lair and heads in to the main courtyard in the hollowed pillar, toward the elevators to the higher levels.

Traveling through the common areas, restaurants and general "outside" seating of the Lair, he catches sight of several groups that are clearly taking note of his passing: Flameguard, Stoneguard and two different factions of Derro it seems...

He quickly heads to the Townhouse.

Safely inside, he lets **Mimble **out and with the assistance of Tark, Doc and JmJm, begins to interrogate the poor Gnome.

Patches, Snorbul, Fey and Cirrus all turn to leave Cairngorm cavern.

Araele, the summer Fae sits back on his rock, pouting as no one takes  him up on his offers.  He does idly say though that "maybe I should try and find my own way out..."

Hgraam begins to walk alongside the group as they head back to Gracksuluth proper.

He questions the group, asking what they plan on doing with Araele.  They respond that they are simply playing hardball and will be back after he has stewed a little.

Hgraam nods and then asks for news about the wider world, asking why everything is beginning to feel like a nightmare.

The conversation goes back and forth, Fey asking what the Stone Giants know of Orcus (not much) and then tells the Stoneshaper of the Demon Prince and his machinations.

Shocked and concerned, Hgraam tells the group to visit the Cloud Giants for information and the Storm Giants for assistance (as they lead the Ordening) when they are done in Gravenhollow.

He also asks Fey about the curse that transformed one of his people.

The curse was so strong that it could have only been done as a part of a ritual that uses a body-part of the target.

Fey remembers that Droki had Giant toenail clippings in his bag from Cairngorm and tells Hgraam to keep a close watch on his people as they are being targeted.

At the exit from the Caverns, the group thanks Hgraam and they take their leave, heading back into the city and the stinking smog of the place.

They head across the city, talking about what to do next.

With several hours before needing to speak with Claudine, the group decide to pick up Gundren and then head to talk with Themberchaud.

As they go, they devise a way to remove Claudine and her daughter from the city - Fey's Fancy Fortress and then a Planeshift to Thunder Bluff.

Meanwhile, Mimble has been properly interrogated and deemed a non-threat.  

Gundren lets him go, but takes two gizmos from his bag and now knows he can find this **Hojo** at the Muzgardt brewery.

The attention of those in the Townhouse then turns to the different people following the group.

They decide to go and catch one and question them - Tark and Gundren head down into the common courtyard, taking the elevator down.

Arriving on the bottom floor, the doors open and the rest of the group is just arriving to The Gholbrorn's Lair.

Gundren quickly tells them his plan and what he's noticed.

Patches confirms and they decide to have some fun.

Gundren beelines it to the closest "agent" tailing them, yelling a greeting and that the "others will be seen to soon"

A number of folk all scurry away, some even bumping into tables and dispelling their invisibility.

Patches spots that one of the Derro scurrying away has the same earring as those she and Gundren executed the day before.

The agent approached by Gundren is assisted as his buddy comes out of invisibility ready to fight.

Cirrus quickly casts a quick soothing Friends on them and the tension is diffused.

jovially greeting their "friends", the group discovers that this tail is from The Stoneguard and are keeping an eye on such an interesting group of adventurers and surface dwellers.

The group is told that if they were to visit The Overlake Hold, they would most likely be offered merc work.

They decline and then head off into the city, leaving the two agents behind with extra drinks, convincing them to stay behind.

Heading out onto the street, Gundren snaps his fingers, remembering.

he forgot to ask the Anvilthew for a supplier of Phase Spider chitin.

Being in the Blade Bazaar now, Gundren figures someone might know and pulls out a couple gold coins, then yells into the crowded marketplace "Does anyone know where I can buy Phase Spider Chitin!".

A number of figures all rush in and crowd around, Patches sees this and gets nervous, spotting several figures that set off alarms.

Gundren hears from the press of people "Modo the Hunter has that!".

Gundren pays the one who mentioned Modo and most of the crowd disperses.

As Patches pushes forward to get to her companions, the Derro that were part of the crowd pull knives and rush forward to attack Gundren.

Patches throws a flash bomb and calls a warning, and the street erupts into chaos...

As people realize a fight is breaking out, people yell and begin running for safety.  From the crowd, almost twenty Derro attack the group.

A volley of lightning bolts leap from the attackers, but Fey slams his staff down and ground them all before they can tear into the crowds of innocents.

The next volley is not as easily dispersed and the group is burned by lances of electricity from four Derro Savants.

The other nearby Derro lash out, cutting and stabbing, hitting Cirrus and Fey with crossbow bolts.

The group reacts quickly, Tark smashing skulls, Gwen leaving Derro mangled and Patches slashing and stabbing.

A large swath of Derro simply fall dead as Cirrus causes a number of them to have aneurisms while Fey blasts several with firebolts.

A Smoke bomb is thrown and then a fireball gem immediately after, blasting one group into oblivion.

The Derro attackers are dead in seconds, though not before leaving the group burned and bloodied (well, some at least).

The group sees Stoneguard rushing in to the area, though they are still a good thirty seconds away.

The corpses at the party's feet tremble and spasm and then reach out.

The Derro all rise as zombies, quickly surrounding the group flailing, striking and clawing.

Fey goes down in a heap, but Patches rushes over, clearing the zombies and feeding her companion a healing potion.

Tark meanwhile begins to dismantle the dead around him.

Gwen continues her impression of industrial accidents and Gundren blasts away with his Thundercannon.

The group takes several more hits from the zombies but then quickly dismantle and destroy the walking cadavers in short order.

Breathing heavily, the group looks around at the blood drenched streets, the corpses now truly mangled and destroyed.

The Stoneguard come to a halt, creating a perimeter and the captain approaches, congratulating the group at their prowess.

Patches slips into a nearby building, climbing to the second level, avoiding the occupants.

She climbs out the window and then leaps across the street to the other side, above the heads of the Stoneguard.

Climbing down the other building and slipping inside, she finds herself in a weapons shop.

Patches quickly incapacitates the owner and then finds the nicest two items in the shop and steals them (an Adamantine Short Sword and a Dagger)

Fey, Cirrus, Gundren and Tark begin to talk to the Stoneguard, who readily accepts their explanation (lots of witnesses).

The group investigates quickly, noting the many earrings on the Derro that they believe match the Cult of Demogorgon.

Rising from the dead however is not really Demogorgon's MO though and Fey looks around.

Reaching out with his magic, Fey feels that no directed spell raised the Derro but that it was something else...
