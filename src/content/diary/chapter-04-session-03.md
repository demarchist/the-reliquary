Lodged in a tree above the ruined tower, Fey'Anon is doubly startled as the Tree grabs at him and Tark simultaneously erupts from his chest harness.  Tark is grabbed by the tree almost instantly, but Fey quickly puts the creature to sleep and it releases them.  Fey is still flying and settles onto the tree, Tark falls, but catches the ruined roof edge and pulls himself up and into the ruins and sees Buumi below - mid coitus with a beautiful woman.

Gundren is looking at the marching Myconoids suspiciously.  He's proven correct when they begin throwing improvised spears at Lothli and Doc B.  Having none of that, Gunren blasts the log out from beneath them, dropping most into the bog where they are devoured.  Doc B. hits the last two with a Thunderwave, killing another before Lothli gets the final one with a well placed arrow.  Gundren is then towed across the gap by Gwen the lion. 

While Buumi is being pressured into sex with a monster, Cyrrus is ransacking her lair.  Finishing up, the Black dragon moves into her chambers and comes face to face with Cyrrus and becomes enraged, biting him.  Being bitten by a Black Dragon, Cyrrus freaks out and immediately teleports away, to safety.

While this is happening, Zhink has been exploring and comes across a massive skull, inside which are glowing mushrooms, a bunch of myconoid footprints (where the attackers came from) and a large slimy hole that descends into darkness.  Seeing a quest goal, Zhink rips one of the massive teeth out of the skull for Cyrrus…who blinks into existence next to him a moment later, covered in blood and acid burns.  Fey shows up and attempts to make a poultice from the surrounding mushrooms but only manages to accidentally poison Cyrrus, who gets horrible diarrhea into the hole in the back of the skull.

The Dragon quickly mollifies and comes back to Buumi, handing him a deep purple egg before flying away, taking all the moss with her.  Buumi looks at the egg in horror but quickly decides to keep it and take care of it as it's his "child".

Tark descends to join Buumi and the rest of the group heads over to the Skull to get some rest.

Arriving in the skull, Tark decides to investigate the hole at the back, jumping down into it and is grabbed by hands covering the walls.  Cyrrus is having some terrible stomach issues still and accidentally shits all over Tark.  Crying out in disgust, Tark struggles against the hands and hears several other voices expressing their own disgust and sees the wall of hands creating faces.
