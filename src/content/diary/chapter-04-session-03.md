Lodged in the tree above the ruined tower, Fëanon was startled twice in quick succession — the tree grabbed at him, and Tark simultaneously erupted from his chest harness, reverting to full size. The tree seized Tark instantly, but Fëanon put the creature to sleep and it released them both. Fëanon, still flying, settled back onto the branches. Tark fell, caught the ruined roof edge, pulled himself up — and looked down to see Buumi below, mid-encounter with a beautiful woman.

## Myconid Ambush

Gundren's suspicion of the marching myconids proved well-founded when they turned and hurled improvised spears at Lothli and Doctor Breakfast. Gundren blasted the log out from beneath the fungal creatures, dropping most of them into the bog where they were devoured by whatever lurked below. Doctor Breakfast hit the last two with a thunderwave, killing one, and Lothli put a well-placed arrow through the final attacker. Gwen the lion towed Gundren across the gap to safety.

## The Dragon's Gift

While Buumi was otherwise occupied, Cyrrus had been ransacking the dragon's lair. The Black Dragon finished with Buumi, moved into her chambers, and came face to face with the thief. She was not amused. Cyrrus was bitten by a Black Dragon and dimension-doored to safety in a blind panic, materialising next to Zhink — who had been exploring a massive skull filled with glowing mushrooms. Zhink, ever helpful, ripped one of the skull's enormous teeth free as a gift for Cyrrus and his patron. Fëanon arrived and attempted to make a healing poultice from the surrounding mushrooms, but only succeeded in poisoning Cyrrus further, giving him catastrophic diarrhea.

Back at the tower, the dragon's anger cooled quickly. She returned to Buumi and presented him with a deep purple egg before flying away, taking all the moss — which had been disguised goblins the entire time — with her. Buumi stared at the egg in horror, realising what it meant. He kept it.

## The Skull and the Tunnel

The group regrouped at the giant skull to rest. Tark, unable to resist investigating the dark hole at the back of the skull, jumped down into it and was immediately seized by hands covering the tunnel walls. Cyrrus, still suffering stomach trouble, was positioned directly above. The results were deeply unfortunate for Tark. Crying out in disgust, Tark struggled against the grasping hands and heard other voices expressing their own revulsion — the wall of hands was forming faces, and they were not happy either.
