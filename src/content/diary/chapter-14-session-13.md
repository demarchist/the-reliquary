As the adrenaline from the battle fades, the group gathers in the Keep courtyard

Troops are sent out to clear the dead, pick up any surviving attackers as prisoners and sent into town to secure the rest of the Barony

The Dwarven gun crews begin to work with Surtr to swap out spent barrels just in case the Dragon is foolish enough to return

the smouldering delzoun “wands” begins to burn a patch of grass as they pile up

With the all-clear horn blown down in the town, the civilians begin to filter out of the keep and the tunnels below and back to their homes

Patches hails down a nearby guard to have Lady Aldencroft sent to her office in the Establishment

Each of the heroes head to their respective lair to rest and recuperate while the B-Team maintains guard over the Barony.

It is early afternoon and the stormy sky begins to break showing warm sunlight and blue skies.

Cirrus returns to his Fane, incensed at the attack and already beginning to formulate a speech to turn it in his favor.

As he walks, he receives a Sending from someone in Silverymoon.

They are aware of the attack, it was not the only one that day and they are sending help though the attack was foiled.

Cirrus holes up in his sanctum to rest and awaits the envoy from Silverymoon

Patches returns to the Establishment and waits for Lady Aldencroft, watching the front door from her private balcony

The lady arrives, looking haggard, she clearly fought that day

She is led to Patches office where they have a face to face meeting

Patches lays it out - The Harpers need her and Patches is a perfect double agent for the Harpers with her knowledge of the Zhentarim

Lady Aldencroft reluctantly agrees to give Patches a Harper badge in exchange for information on the Zhent Silvertongues of Baldur’s Gate and Luskan.

They trade a few more barbs and thinly veiled insults before Lady Aldencroft takes her leave and Patches retires to her sanctum.

Tark, empowered by Vaketh, flies north to meditate on Zhengyi’s assault

Feanon returns to his Tower, leaving his apprentices to help secure the keep.

As he arrives in the foyer, he notes the new apprentice: The young elven woman, Sinya Maya, attending the Front Desk.

This annoys him as she has yet to pass his security tests.

She notes him enter, and his annoyance and sheepishly tells him that three people have just teleported into the tower and are being attended to by Theodemir 

Feanon takes his elevator up and messages Theodemir to take his leave.

As the older wizard leaves the meeting, they share memories and Feanon is instantly caught up on the goings on

Mordenkainen, Megno and Sejuk (Arcanist of Silverymoon) are here.

A dark ziggurat, almost identical to the one the group just destroyed was killed beneath Sundabar by Mordenkainen and the Delzoun Emperor and his personal guard.

The Ziggurat beneath Sundabar was grown from the life force of Megno’s apprentice; Molly, who is now dead with the Phylactery of the Ziggurat being destroyed.

Feanon enters the room and the conversation continues as if he had been there the whole time

Megno is beside himself, feeling that he failed his apprentice.  

He wishes to join Feanon in his tower and help to research these ziggurats and Zhengyi.

Feanon accepts him as his Sage.

Sejuk takes his leave, wanting to meet with Baron Cirrus.  He remarks that he still has not forgiven Feanon for blowing up his house.

Mordenkainen then dives into the specifics of his own visit - he has many questions he was hoping Feanon could answer.

On Oerth, Mordy has been battling a cabal of Liches bringing in monsters and magics through trans-dimensional portals. 

Strange monsters and corruption are being brought through. Monsters that are almost invisible, with acid blood and reproduce by planting eggs in victims. Feanon recognizes he is talking about Alghouls but says nothing.

Mordy gestures at the broken Phylactery of the Ziggurat, made of black Sourcestone and Prismeum, remarking that he has never seen black crystal like this, and Prismeum is so rare as to be mythical

The Black Sourcestone is covered in runes, but due to the damaged nature, nothing could be gleaned from them.

Feanon shares what information he has on Sourcestone, careful to omit mention of Vecna

The Prismeum is still a mystery, but based on the grafted abomination at the heart of the Ziggurat, Mordy suspects that nothing short of ancient Netherese magics could twist something so vile.

As the conversation winds down - each question ending in mystery - Mordy motions at Feanons Ice staff.

The archwizard remarks that its past time Feanon crafts his own epic staff so that he can join the other Archwizards of The Circle of Mystra in the Astral Sea.

Admittance to “The Rock” is only allowed once a wizard has been invited and crafted their Archwizard’s staff.

Feanon says he will utilize prismeum to make his and Mordenkainen is impressed.

The Archwizard then takes his leave to stay at Patches establishment

Feanon begins to rest.

JmJm broodingly strides back to his Theater, ravens cawing and following

Once there, he begins to play the Organ atop the stage, summoning his band of Thespians.

Once they all arrive, JmJm begins his “lessons” to them and then continues to work on his new masterpiece before getting some much needed rest.

They all take a much needed long rest and night falls on the barony without incident.  

The inhabitants begin to celebrate their victory and offer praises to Selune.

Patches leaves her sanctum to meet up with everyone that evening.  As she leaves she spots a sealed envelope just past the tunnel door, sealed with the wax seal of Bregan D'aerthe

Wearing gloves, she carefully opens the envelope and finds a black coin within with the relief of a woman's head on one side and the other is too scratched up to tell. 

A note inside reads “For Luck” - Jarlaxle.

JmJm awakes with a cold sweat and gooseflesh

He extricates himself from the orgy pile of sleeping people and moves off the “sleeping” dais.

A pale witchlight illuminates a nearby alcove and then a ghostly figure phases through the wall.

It is an old looking elf with regal bearing and a striking physical similarity to JmJm

The old king sighs and looking over JmJm, proclaims his line doomed

The ghost is JmJm’s great great grandfather on his mother’s side; Xrykalos

He says he has come to answer the prayers of his Great Grandaughter - JmJm’s mother

She prays for Bowie’s (JmJm’s father) safe return

Xrykalos’ restless shade has come to implore JmJm to find his father.

To assist, three ghostly “cousins” of JmJm have also come and will assist the bard in his performance in the most dire of circumstances.

JmJm is elated and he and his ghost band head into the Barony (with the ghosts possessing a few Thespians) to celebrate while Xrykalos remains behind, brooding about JmJm’s lack of seriousness.

Cirrus communes with his Celestial ally; Crisserei

They discuss how to best protect the barony from attacks like the one it suffered this day

The planetar offers a celestial gift of awareness and Cirrus accepts and finds that he can immediately detect any hostile creature within the barony.  He does not know who they are, but he can tell where they are.

Thousands of silvery eyes festoon the Fane, granting this danger sense.

Cirrus immediately becomes aware of several enemies of his within the Barony.

Several are all at Feanon’s tower, clouding Cirrus’ ability to discern who it may be.

One however is on the road to town and Cirrus remembers a newcomer to the barony, an asian man and purveyor of bows who appeared while the group was in Al’Askar

Cirrus continues to compose a speech for the evening's festivities…

The sun sets and a full moon rises

The Barony begins to celebrate their victory

The group gathers in the center of town, several of them at The Establishment

Buumi is unconscious in a booth after being poisoned by Patches for trying to kiss her

She’s working on getting him trained to resist Drow Poisons if they are to court properly

The town center is bustling and Cirrus cannot pass up such an opportunity to rally his people

He spots Mordenkainen and Sejuk in the crowd enjoying some street food

He marches up to the stage in the center of town (used for announcements) and ascends the stairs to address his people

Cirrus makes a rousing speech, blaming Amn for the day’s attack and successfully stoking the populace against the Amnian nation

Cirrus then announces that enemies are in their midst (sensing the Boweyer in the crowd) and gestures for the man to be arrested.

The man tries to make a break for it but is quickly apprehended by the powerful group

Cirrus approaches the man, who spits on him and with a cold rage, says “The Warlocks of Ceregorach will all die!!”

The man then bites down on something and his head explodes in a shower of red

People in the crowd scream and several throw up. 

Cirrus wastes no time beginning to have people cleaned via prestidigitation and has the body taken to the Fane.

He may still get some answers from a headless corpse, but it sure makes it more difficult

He ends his speech with the dramatic death, seemingly taking credit for smiting the man and the festivities continue

The story of how Cirrus killed the man by making his head explode spreads through town.

Its been a crazy day and there’s still much mystery surrounding the days events

Cirrus has another batch of prisoners to interrogate and JmJm offers his theater as the location to do it

They insist Sejuk and Mordenkainen join them in interrogating the Goblin commanders of Ancalagon’s forces

In the Theater, Cirrus opens the door to his Demi plane and is greeted by a sight

The Goblins have sat in a circle in the center of the room, facing out and have been waiting for Cirrus to return

The moment the door opens, one yells “He’s back! GET IM!”

Goblin Bosses rush the door, Spellcasters release their spells…

But Cirrus is faster and a wave of Hypnotic energy rolls over them

The Goblin Booyagh’s try and counterspell it, but their magic is nothing compared to Cirrus’

The group enters the Demiplane to question the stunned Goblins and they arrange each flat on their back in the strangely non-descript room

Mordenkainen then restrains them with a Wall of Force, stopping them from getting up

Each goblin is then shaken from its stupor and questioned, one at a time. 

Most spit curses and refuse to betray their master so Patches ends them

They manage to piece together some of the events until finally the last of the Goblins, lying in a pool of its comrades blood, cracks and cooperates

A Boss named Gurk.

Ancalagon is a vassal of Zhengyi’s power structure, not the Amnians

The Amnians got the Doomstar Legion involved

Ancalagon met with the Amnians and was “re-tasked” to come to the Barony

Their goal was the birth of the Ziggurat to then pincer the Barony between two forces, it did not go as planned (due to it lacking any kind of intelligence)

Ancalagon answers to a Dragon above himself, Gurk does not know his name, only that Ancalagon got his fancy new armor from him

Gurk will go and spy on Ancalagon for the group (he promised this under pain of death, but we will see)

The group has Gurk taken to Feanon’s tower for processing

They then leave the blood-drenched demiplane to discuss next steps in the real world

Mordenkainen will return to Oerth to continue to battle the Lich Cabal and their other-worldly assistance (he could really use the groups information on Alghouls and Vecna, feanon did not tell him and no one else has enough context to bring it up)

Sejuk will return to Silverymoon and inform the Council that the Amnians and Zhengyi are arrayed against them and creating these Ziggurats

Feanon then decides to try scrying on the four Ziggurats Sejuk reported

He has no luck with two, but the others he manages to catch glimpses of

Both are travelling, the Sourcestone slabs cracked with fleshy arms and tendrils dragging itself forward

Both are wreathed in storms (control weather), limiting visibility

The storms have Oni in them, likely as guardians

He caught a glimpse of a massive body of water to the south

Patches spots Tark on the roof of JmJm’s theater

She climbs up to her friend

The monk is sitting on the roof, watching the group discuss their plans.  He has a travelling pack next to him

Patches notes it and reassures her friend; She will go with him East to deal with Zhengyi and she has talked with the others.

They will all go.

In the morning, the group heads East to deal with the Witch King of Vaasa.
