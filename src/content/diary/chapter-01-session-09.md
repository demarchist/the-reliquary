The party awoke in the tavern, returned from the nightmare realm of the hag lair. JmJm, Patches, Gundren, Lothli, and Tark all found that Doctor Breakfast and Buumi had carried them to safety but couldn't rouse them. Strangely, every item they'd collected in the dream had materialized beside them.

## Rewards and Loose Ends

Sildar arrived with Harkell to hear the group's account. Both were alarmed by the reports of hags and undead monstrosities. Sildar paid the group 250 gold for rescuing Gundren, and Barthen — Gundren's other brother — appeared and paid another 250 gold before entering the Tavern of Doors with Gundren to see their surviving, comatose brother.

Harkell teleported back to the Ivy Mansion in Longsaddle to research what might be happening. The party gathered their things and headed to the town center to meet the mayor. Harbrim paid them 500 gold for dealing with the Drow threat and clearing Cragmaw Castle. Sister Gisele arrived and gave each party member a healing potion for their help with Agatha the banshee.

All of this played out beneath the shadow of Iarno's gallows — the traitor had been hanged in their absence.

## The Dragon Returns

As the group prepared to leave with Sildar for Neverwinter, a rider galloped in screaming about a dragon. Venomfang swept overhead and landed on the mansion atop the hill. But this was not the same dragon they'd robbed in Thundertree. Its scales were cracking, revealing an orange glow from within. Its eyes burned the same sickly orange, and dark smoke trailed from its wings.

The town rallied to defend itself. Venomfang attacked the group directly, shrieking "THIEVES!" as it launched from the building. Doctor Breakfast called down a massive lightning bolt from the storm building overhead, knocking the dragon out of the sky. It crashed into the center of town and entered a frenzy.

Tark charged forward, quaffing the Potion of Fire Giant Strength, and battered the dragon's face with tremendous force — shattering scale and bone. Venomfang breathed on the group, then charged Buumi, smashing his shield and hurling him across the square, nearly killing him.

After a brief but savage battle, the dragon died in the town center. Harbrim stormed over to the corpse demanding to know how the group had brought this upon them. But a building magical energy pulsed within the dragon's body. JmJm reached for the corpse, then thought better of it at the last moment and stepped back.

## The Dracolich

Venomfang exploded in a gout of ash and black smoke. When it cleared, a Dracolich stood where the dragon had fallen — skeletal, burning with necrotic energy, a massive orange-glowing gemstone embedded in its chest. Its first act was to tear Harbrim in half.

The Dracolich breathed on the party and the gathered crowd. The adventurers took minor damage. The townsfolk were not so lucky — the blast killed half the population of Phandalin and raised them as zombies.

JmJm and Doctor Breakfast performed a dual synchronized Thunderwave at the zombie horde, obliterating most of them and pushing the rest into a heap of dead flesh. Tark, still empowered by the potion, picked up the dragon and hurled it into a nearby building.

The Dracolich crawled from the wreckage and snapped at Fëanon, who blocked with his shield. Patches leaped forward and drove her dagger into the beast as Lothli fired arrows from across the plaza. Doctor Breakfast unleashed a healing wave that brought the group back to full strength. Tark grabbed the dragon by the tail and flung it onto the mass of crushed zombies.

The battle raged on — the Dracolich smashing through buildings and the party alike. Patches leaped onto its back and slashed with vicious precision, severing its spine and detaching its body from the waist down. The dragon dragged itself forward on its front claws, making desperate attacks. Tark stepped in, grabbed the glowing gemstone in its chest, and tore the phylactery heart from its rotting body. The Dracolich crumbled to ash.

## Departure

The group now held the phylactery heart of a dragon turned undead. The town lay in ruins around them — half its people dead, its mayor torn in two.

Sildar emerged from the rubble, insisting they leave immediately for Neverwinter to report what had happened. The group agreed, piling into the Tavern of Doors as Lothli secured a wandering, now-ownerless horse and rode hard for Neverwinter.
