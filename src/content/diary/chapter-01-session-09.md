The group awakens in a tavern, returning from the nightmare world of the hag den.  JmJm, Patches, Gundren, Lothli and Tark all awake to find that Dr.B and Buumi managed to take them from the fields just outside town into the safety of the towns tavern but could not wake them.  Recounting tale, Sildar joins the group with Harkell to express their dismay and confusion about the reports of hags and undead monstrosities.  Strangely, as they awoke, all the items that they picked up in the dream reality materialized next to them.  He pays the group 250gp for rescuing Gundren and Barthen, Gundrens other brother shows up and pays them another 250gp before going into the box with Gundren to see their other surviving brother.

Harkell at this point teleports to The Ivy Mansion in Longsaddle to do some research on what may be happening.  The group gathers their things and head to the town center to meet the Mayor; Harbrim.  Harbrim pays the group 500gp for taking care of the Drow plans and Cragmaw castle, Sister Gisele shows up and gives each member of the group a healing potion for conferring with Agatha the Banshee.  All of this is happening in the shadow of the Hanged Iarno.

As the group prepares to leave with Sildar for Neverwinter to report the happenings a Rider comes in screaming about a Dragon, just as Venomfang flies overhead and lands on the Mansion on the hill. The dragon looks sickly, it's scales cracking and showing an orange glow from within, the dragons eyes glow orange and dark smoke trails from it's wings.  The town rallies to defense and the Dragon attacks the group, yelling "THIEVES".  Attempting to fly overhead, the dragon takes off from the building, only to be knocked from the sky by a massive lightning bolt from the storm building overhead (Doc B).  Crashing into the center of town, the Dragon enters a frenzy.  Tark leaps forwards, quaffing a Fire Giant Strength potion and batters the dragons face tremendously, shattering scale and bone.  The Dragon breathes on the group, and then charges buumi, smashing his shield and throwing him far away, wounding him direly.  After a brief but intense battle, the dragon is killed in the center of town, Harbrim storms over to the corpse, asking the group how they managed to bring this down on them.  Sensing a building magical energy within the dragon, the group backs off, JmJm reaching for the dragons corpse but deciding at the last moment not to go near it.  The dragon explodes in a gout of ash and black smoke.  As it clears, they see a Dracolich standing before them, tearing Harbrim in half and then charging the group, a massive orange glowing gemstone in it's chest.

The Dragon breathes on the group, which take only minor damage, but the crowd of villagers that had gathered take the full blast, killing half the town and raising them as zombies.

The group engages, Tark, with his strength picks up the dragon and throws it into a nearby building.

JmJm and Dr.b do a dual synchronized Thunderwave at the zombies, all but destroying them and pushing them into a heap of dead flesh. Climbing out of the smashed building, the dragon snaps it's maw towards Faye, smashing him backwards as the maw hits his shield.  Patches leaps forwards, plunging her dagger into the beast as arrows fly from Lothli across the plaza.

Running forwards, Dr.B unleashes a healing wave, bringing the group back to full strength.  Tark then picks up the Dragon by the tail and flings it onto the mass of destroyed Zombies, squashing them further.

The battle continues, the dragon smashing the town and the group.  Patches leaps atop it's back and slashes wickedly with her weapons, severing it's vertebrae and detaching it's body from the waist down.  Running forwards, the dragon making a few desperate attacks at the group, Tark grabs it's gem heart and tears it from it's rotted body, turning the dragon into a corpse once more as it disintegrates to ash.

The group now have the phylactery heart of this Dragon turned Undead.

The town in ruins, Sildar appears from some rubble, insisting they go directly to Neverwinter to inform the Lord about what happened.  The group complies, hopping into the ToD as Lothli secures a wandering now-ownerless horse and rides off towards Neverwinter…
