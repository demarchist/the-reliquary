**Waking up and Wind Walking**

The night is uneventful, and for the first time, Tark does not have nightmares.  Instead, he dreams.

In the dream, Kenshi visits him in the monastery and they talk.  Tark tells Kenshi of their quest, their destination and their location in the Underdark as well as the strange planar cracks.

Kenshi is most concerned and says he will try and let people know, but his own knowledge of the Underdark is very limited.

Tark mentions the Darklake and their destination of Gracksuluth and Kenshi says he only has a passing knowledge of the names but will see who he can talk to about the situation.

They spend the remainder of the dream training and sparring, practicing the technique that Kenshi showed Tark last time: Extract Aspects.

The​ Group awakens, half in the glorious mansion, the rest outside in the Tiny Hut.

Inside the magical mansion, Fey leaves his chambers, clad in silks and walks to the balcony descending down to the lavish dining area and the massive banquet set up there.

Doc B uncurls from his sleeping position and looks over just in time to get a glimpse inside Fey's chamber, the place filled with duplicates of the elven Wizard Lemerlais...and JmJm sneaking from the room.

Gundren stirs, hacks up a lugie and then downs his morning shot of mama Rockseeker's Gutbuster Brew.

JmJm slinks from the shadows, intrigued at the drink and asks for a taste.

Gundren veritably throws it at JmJm's face and the Bard swears, and then yells at the Dwarf for being so uncouth.

Doc heads over to the Banquet, but has a hard time reaching the table and accidentally pulls the tablecloth, and food, onto the floor when one of his claws gets caught.

Fey walks over, snaps his fingers and the table is re-arranged, now slightly lower to help out Doc.

Patches and Cirrus both enter the mansion remarking that they were not bothered by any other Mind Flayers and they are ready to head out for the day.

They swing by the buffet, though Cirrus is hesitant worried about biting his tongue with his new teeth, but digs in (carefully)

Deciding to head out, Fey tells them he will end the spell in 10 minutes and everyone should get their things.

Outside, Tark waits, invisible by the bags of holding.

After several minutes, the rest of the group simply appears next to him as the Magnificent Mansion spell ends.

Patches whispers "Tark?"

the Halfling responds and drops the invisibility.

Doc B sets out a pattern of flower petals and begins to cast Wind Walk.  As it ends, a great gust of wind picks up the petals and sweeps up the group, carrying them down the winding tunnels of the Underdark.

Speeding along, the group makes amazing speed.

As they leave the area from the night before, they see the source of the commotion that put them on alert: a Goblin village, deserted.  Several corpses lay about, including one or two Intellect Devourers.

The group continues on and many hours later speed past a great stone pillar, scored and torn by massive claws.

Pressing on, the they notice scat piles from something big, filled with the bones of large creatures and humanoids and they notice little sparks of electricity and static in the darkness, flickering around the tunnels.

The group presses on, unwilling to investigate the area and after a half hour, they clear the area of static.

As the day wears on, they pass through a large section of Insect hive, each creature the size of a thumb with a slightly glowing abdomen.  The group presses on.

Just as they begin to see Duergar Mile Markers, the group enters a section of Wild Magic and the Wind Walk Spell destabilizes and ends prematurely.

The group is deposited at speed and everyone comes to a rushing halt, stumbling slightly.

**Faerzress**

Fey'Anon looks around and realizes that they are in an area suffused with Wild Magic, he tries to look for the source but the area is irradiated, making it hard to gauge direction.

Gundren and Patches both spot it quickly though - a glint of crystal in the cavern walls and they head over to confirm: Faerzress crystals.  Crystallized magic.

JmJm has a hard time dealing with the tunnels and decides to storm off.

Patches drops a globe of darkness over the half elf, who lets out a little yelp and walks into the cavern wall.

The rest of the group heads down the tunnel a ways, not wanting to be around the Crystals as Gundren has decided to try and harvest one.

The darkness on JmJm ends and he watches curiously as Gunren goes in with a small hammer and pick and hits the stone.

Sparks fly, and to JmJm, it looks like the wall simply crumbles and disgorges a large crystal chunk.

Gundren however gets a much different view, as after the first hit Time simply stops.

Looking around, Gundren sees the sparks mid flight and JmJm mid sentence.  He shrugs and goes back to freeing the crystal, hitting the right areas to free the crystal quickly.

Time resumes and JmJm lets out a gasp as every hit from Gundren takes effect simultaneously.

Gundren bends down and scoops up the crystal in a gloved hand and then turns to head off toward the group.

JmJm rushes to follow.

Back at the group, Gundren shows them the Faerzress crystal, smoke wafting up slightly from his gloved hand where it touches the thing. 

Gundren covers it in oil and then wraps it in heavy leathers until he can craft, or buy a lead box to properly shield the crystal.

The group continues on and after a few miles, Patches gets her bearings and realizes they are close to The Crossroads, a nexus of well traveled tunnels that lead to the Darklake and Menzoberranzan among other places.

Doc stops, seeing a cluster of small Fireweed and decides to ask them some questions.

Communing with nature, Doc is told that the Crossroads they approach is occupied by Orcs and Giant Spiders and that Fiends had passed trough recently.

The group discusses what to do and decide that if they have to say "who they are" to any people they come across, they should be honest (more or less).

The group continues on, and when they are about 30 minutes from the cavern, Tark wraps gloom around them with Pass without Trace.

**The Crossroads**

They stop at the entrance to a large cavern, easily two hundred feet across and ascending up beyond sight.

Patches pulls out her telescope and peers into the cavern, the place dimly lit by bio-luminescence.  She sees movement near the far end of the cavern, but its indistinct.

Tark goes invisible and shadowsteps into the cavern, then looking to the ceiling, shadowsteps to a stalactite and sniffs.  He smells the sweaty Orcs and something else, some kind of sweet yet earthy perfume.

He returns to the group and they head into the cavern, ready for a fight.

Just as the group gets past the midpoint, a roaring fills the cavern and the Orcs spring their attack, rushing the group.  They look confused and disoriented though, searching for targets.

Fey reaches out to cast a Hypnotic Pattern but is Counterspelled.  Fey turns to the others in a panic - Orcs don't Counterspell.

Tark, Patches and Mr Pickles rush into melee, making short work of the Orcs they are up against.

Gundren starts blasting away and Cirrus unleashes a Sickening Radiance, burning half of the Orcs to ash.

The distraction worked perfectly.

As the group engages, and slaughters the Orcs the Drow waiting above in the darkness, drop.

The two priestesses release their Hold Person spells, freezing JmJm, Fey, Gundren and Mr. Pickles while the others manage to shake it off.

A Drow wizard drops to the stone and tries to Banish Tark, but the monk manages to resist the spell, still not sure whats happening as he faces off against the last few goblins in a side tunnel.

​Out in the main cavern, the situation is dire as no fewer than sixteen Drow assault the group, focusing on the held party members first.

Dozens of attacks rain in, all pommel strikes and punches as the Drow subdue the group, not killing them.

Tark hears a melodic female voice call out to "take them alive!".

Realizing what's happening, Tark shadowsteps away and goes invisible, unwilling to chance the Artifacts falling into the hands of the Drow.  He looks back and sees Gundren, Fey and JmJm downed quickly, surrounded by foes and then scooped up and levitated up into the gloom of the ceiling.

Patches grabs Doc and dashes away, seeing dozens of enemies behind her, but fewer ahead as well as the tantalizing prize of a Drow Priestess.

One of the priestesses summons an insect swarm of thousands of spiders to fall upon the rogue and druid just as a trio of Drow warriors pull their hand crossbows and release a volley of poisoned darts into Patches.

She parries the first bolt, but takes two more.  Resisting the first dose of poison, the second takes drastic effect and she drops instantly unconscious.

Doc wails, not sure what to do and a massive eruption of earth cascades out from the angry druid, pulverizing every remaining orc in the area and slamming two Drow, including the Wizard.

The wizard falls to the ground, coughing blood but reaches out and Banishes Doc.

Cirrus awakes from the poison dart as the Orc carrying him is destroyed by Doc.  He enacts his ice tomb and watches.

The fight is over.  The group lost.

Tark watches invisible, waiting for an opportunity.

One of the priestesses approaches the ice tomb holding Cirrus.

Wearing fine form fitting mesh armor and flowing robes, layered with a Piwafwi cloak and a full helmet shaped into the likeness of a spider head, complete with mandables.  The priestess has a small shield on one arm, a mace on her belt, a writing mass of snakes on the other hip and a strange set of rubbery looking tendrils wrapped around her mid section.  A single braid of start white hair falls down her back and is the only thing to show her as Drow as no skin is showing.

Leaning in, she taps a long claw against the ice and in perfect common, tells Cirrus to "Surrender or Die".   The helmet has gem-like eyes and they glitter in the dim light of the cavern.

The tomb ends abruptly and Cirrus raises his hands in supplication...and then vanishes.

Farstepping away and then sprinting down a side tunnel.

Tark sees four of the Drow go in pursuit, but they return within seconds saying that the strange spellcaster continued to teleport away, out distancing them instantly.

The two priestesses and the wizard begin to talk quietly as the wizard prepares a teleportation circle.

Just as he finishes the circle, the levitating warriors drop from the ceiling with their captives, vanishing in a flash.  The other nearby warriors step in and vanish as well, leaving the five surviving Orcs, the Drow Wizard, the two Priestesses and another four Drow warriors.

Tark, invisible and using his staff to fly, gets in close and listens.

He hears the quiet conversation in Drow, but understands and hears them say that the information they got was accurate, and it was a powerful group that if they had not attacked with their entire force, they doubt they could have taken them.  Tark hears a little confusion in the conversation as they wonder just who they captured as they most certainly were not traders or unprepared surface dwellers.

The wizard finishes a second teleportation circle and the remaining Drow and Orcs step through, vanishing.

Tark does not follow but instead darts off to chase down Cirrus.

Following the tunnel, Tark darts through them for an hour, praying to find his companion.

Cirrus meanwhile has stopped, breathing heavily in a small chamber.  Looking around, he sees a crack in the wall and goes to hide in it, summoning the Tiny hut and thinking furiously.  They need help.

Pulling out the small metal cage, a light glowing inside, Cirrus asks the soul of the Orc where his friends were taken: Velkynvelve.  The Warlock finds out the direction, distance and general layout of the cavern - Orcs beneath and the Drow living up on the ceiling.  

He thanks the Orc and then consumes it.

Cirrus looks up when he hears a tapping on the outside of the dome and Tark drops his invisibility.

Cirrus lets Tark inside the Dome and they discuss the next step; they need help and they need to rescue their friends.

Cirrus summons his tiny messenger and quickly pens a letter, telling Buumi of the situation and that he needs him asleep ASAP.

He gets a letter in reply and finds out that Megno is at the Barony with Buumi.

Cirrus waits twenty minutes and then enacts a Dreaming, contacting Buumi and showing him their location and further clarifying the situation.

Buumi is shocked, concerned and adamant that they save their friends.  Buumi has Cirrus end the dream and do another to show Mengo the teleport location.

An hour later, a flash of light and crack of thunder and Megno and Buumi are standing in the same cavern looking at Cirrus and Tark.

Tark rushes over to hug his friend and they embrace.

They begin to formulate a plan.

Megno casts a sending to Fey'Anon telling him they are on the way.  They get a short reply that Fey is blindfolded, restrained and alone currently.

Megno switches and Sends to Patches, telling her a rescue is coming and that it's about 20 hours away. 

Patches responds; they will be ready.

**Velkynvelve**

One hour or so earlier:

Patches awakens, a large clawed hand rolling her over as she lies against the floor.

Looking around, she sees that she is in a large metal cage - a dome with weblike bars, and no apparent door.

The large cavern is lit dimly by purple faerie fire lights covering the nearby Stalacmites. Below the large ledge that the cage rests on, is a carpet of thick spider-webs, the light giving them an almost luminous quality.  At the far end of the Stalacmite compound, bridges of Spider Silk connecting each spire, a waterfall roars down to the cavern floor several hundred feet below.

Patches notes the hand on her and the creature staring down at her, it's large unblinking fish eyes looking out from a humanoid, ridiculous fish body - a Kuo-Toa.

He introduces himself as **Shuushar. **

Behind the Kuo-toa, a little walking mushroom, a Myconid Sprout, peeks out inquisitively.

Shuushar introduces the Myconid as **Toadstool**.

The creature tells her to remain calm in a gurgling watery voice.

Patches ignores the thing and looks around, seeing a number of people she doesn't recognize as well as the rest of her captured party.  

Fey is missing though.

In the cell with the group are a set of young deep gnome twins, a large grey skinned Orc man with wrinkles around his eyes and salt and pepper hair, The fishlike blue and green Kuo-Toa in brown rags, a Sullen looking Drow Male in tattered Drow garb, and a small brown Myconid Sprout with two stumpy little legs and a crazed looking Derro in a red robe playing with rocks in a corner.

The two gnomes stare at Doc B until he notices and heads over.  

They talk in a strange dialect of Gnomish but they can understand one another. 

Doc B finds out their village was raided and they ran for it, being captured by the Drow.

The tips of their ears have been docked

They introduce themselves as **Topsy and Turvey**.

Meanwhile, Gundren has awoken and sauntered over to the Drow imprisoned with them.

He introduces himself and then promptly starts beating the Elf, demanding to know where they are.

The Drow; **Sarith** cries out in pain and shock and blurts out the name of the place: **Velkynvelve.**

**Mr Pickles **goes up to Shuushar and asks for a Shiv.  Shuurshar has none but breaks off a piece of a claw to give to the little goblin.

JmJm goes up to the bars and starts to yell, demanding to be seen by the boss.

Out of the darkness, a hand-crossbow bolt strikes him in the shoulder and he falls to the ground bleeding.

The large Orc walks over to JmJm and helps him to his feet and introduces himself as **Ront**

He  likes the groups attitude, arguing and fighting rather than cowering before the Drow. 

JmJm smiles and pulls the dart from his shoulder, stowing the shiv away for later.

He turns back to the bars and yells again.  A figure approaches the bars from the outside and a Drow comes into view.

A male drow, badly burned across the face and with one hand missing two fingers, the old wounds are not pretty.

JmJm cries out in disgust and recoils a little.  He then proceeds to mock the Drow for his appearance and many of the other group members inside join in, laughing.

The drow looks flustered and lashes out, stabbing JmJm in the ribs with a small dagger, spitting on him and then storms away, furious.

Ront chuckles and turns to see a commotion at the back of the cage.

Sarith has grown a backbone and turns on Gundren, slugging the Dwarf across the face.

Gundren blows out a snot rocket of blood and then goes to strike the Drow...until Mr. Pickles leaps on his back stabbing away with a sharp splinter of talon.

Sarith screams and falls to the ground bleeding badly.

A sharp voice calls out "Enough" and a Drow priestess approaches out of the darkness, flanked by the Drow Wizard (still bloody) from the battle. 

she waves her hand and a flash of light washes over the bleeding Sarith.  His wounds scab over and he stops bleeding, eyes fluttering open. 

Patches notes her armor and rank and realizes this was the Priestess who led the capture force.

still outfitted for battle, the priestess has her snake-headed whip in hand, the snakes coiling around her forearm.

The priestess approaches the bars where JmJm stands and looks him over, amused.  JmJm croons and begins to lay on the charm, not able to resist a pretty face.

Patches hisses at JmJm to watch his step.

The prisoners all turn their attention to the Priestess, who says her name is **Ilvara Mizzrym** and that they are all prisoners and slaves of Menzoberranzan.

She turns to leave and saunters off with the (silent) wizard.  As she goes, Gundren says "Bitch..." and she spins, lashing out with a hand and a pillar of flame erupts above the Dwarf.

Diving to the side, Gundren is still badly burned and falls unconscious. Doc B rushes to help as Ilvara spins, laughing and continues to walk away...

Patches watches her go, happy not to have been noticed.  

She's broken from her thoughts by a magical message from **Megno Slatesunder**.  

He and Buumi have teleported to the Underdark and met up with Tark and Cirrus.  

They are coming to rescue them in 20 hours.
