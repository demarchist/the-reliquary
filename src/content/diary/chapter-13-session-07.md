The group continues their ferry ride across the waterways of Thueba Swamp

As night falls, they take a break on a small island

Buumi gets Camea to help him cook so he can learn from her

There is a discussion about Tiefling diet as Buumi tries to make something palatable for Cirrus

Feanon summons his magnificent mansion and the pampered members of the group prepare retire to it

They are distracted by a sound and look across the darkening horizon, spotting a large flying beetle

The beetle approaches to land, blowing a veritable hurricane and they note three elves and an insectoid person riding it.

It lands nearby.

One of the elves addresses the group and they find that these elves are of the Obsidian Order and work with Jareem.

These are Desert Elves.

The elves are not friendly and do not join the group at their fire

The Elves report (once they confirm these are the Outlanders they seek) that the Machina factory is within a few days travel nearby and they mark it on the groups map

While they say no monsters of Zalaam seem to be at the Factory, they suspect some creatures remain, and suspect a trap.

They warn of Yugoloth fiends - extra-planar mercenaries

While this is happening, the insectoid piloting the giant beetle is fascinating to Tark

it is a Thri-kreen, a hive-dwelling creature and it has strange psionics that Tark and Feanon pick up on

As the Elves look like they are about to leave, JmJm asks if they can stay and help with the battle against Zalaam

The elves mention that they have been fighting Zalaam for an age, and their other tasks are far more important that staying with the Outlanders.

The elves go on to mention have a camp near the temple of Fawden and are dealing with the cult of Zalaam in the Black Sea

The Desert elves are surprised at the appearance of some of the group and call out the dark skin of Patches and Snorbul, offending several of the group

They mention that they have never seen a purple Jun Sahara

The elves then leave with their mount and Thri-kreen pilot, while some of the group call after them, offended on Patches behalf

Patches and Cirrus then have a long talk about hurt feelings which morphs into a theological discussion about the ascendance of mortals to godhood

The next day the group awakes to dense mists and fog; the mists surrounding Aina Pulu

The group heads through the mists and after a time, they near the halfling village and they prepare their deception and infiltration of the village.

The group splits and half go into the Ethereal Plane and Buumi and Feanon turn into smoke and become contained in bottles

The group traverses the mists with Camea’s guidance and before long they part to reveal a halfling village nestled into the swamp

On the docks of the village, a large warparty of corrupted halflings, led by shamans is waiting for Camea

After a tense standoff, and the Shaman asking the bones about Tark and Patches (which Tark manages to knock over one of the bones for a better result) Camea manages to successfully smuggle them in under the disguise of prisoners

She, Tark and Patches are escorted through the village to the throne of the High-priest, with the other group navigating the Ethereal plane and the dark shades drifting there.

They arrive at the Throne to discover Camea’s brother presiding over “court” with a massive corrupted Sacrosu (monstrous crocodile) seemingly as his pet at his “feet” (the thing is taller than a halfling lying down).

Tark manages to put on a good show, and narrowly avoids having his fingers cut off by Camea’s corrupted brother, but the *good *halfling manages to convince her brother not to “spoil” the sacrifices to Hohonu.

Narrowly avoiding mutilation, the group in the Prime Material then leaves the village, taking to the mists once more, though being escorted as prisoners.  They follow a willow-wisp type light through the mists, toward the sacrificial pits

The Ethereal group follows, but during this leg of the difficult journey, they find their vision far more obscured by the dark spirits and echoes of the past and fall behind

Worried that the Material group will get into trouble, Gundren gets out the Tablet of sending they stole from the Cultists and sends a message to Patches to kill some time to let them catch up.

The message works and the group re-unite on the other side of the mists; where they part to reveal an expanse of bubbling tar pits spewing forth noxious fumes.

Up ahead, surrounded by massive bones, grisly trophies and surrounded by prostrate worshippers, they see the Altar of Hohonu, and the Dark Halfling Shaman presiding over the grisly ritual…
