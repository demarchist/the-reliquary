The huge giant looks down at the group, his face stoic and unreadable.

It takes a few minutes, but the other giants approach quickly and the group gets a good look at them.

They are all blue-skinned and pale eyed, wearing thick leathers with Mammoth tusk adornments on their shoulders and mammoth-fur cloaks.  They all look to be covered in small wounds from the Gnolls.

There is a female giant with bob-cut silver hair and a mammoth calf in her arms.

A young beardless male, carrying a large chest on his back with iron chains.

An adult male, huge, with light blue hair and a handlebar mustache.

The old giant with a massive beard and dark eyes.

The Giants exchange words and the female puts down the little baby mammoth and begins casting healing spells on it.

Tark gets out his healing kit and tends to the big mammoth and then the baby, both appreciating the help and further ingratiating the group with the giants.

The female casts a quick spell and introduces herself in common as Meljir.

She introduces the others as Mimor (old giant), Ljokjar (with blue hair) and Fen (the young one). They are her family and they are heading to a feast celebrating the marriage of Ljokjar to the Skuldir Tribe's new Matriarch.

After a quick conversation, the giants turn and begin walking across the frozen lake, beckoning the group to follow.

Meljir tells the group that Honor demands Hospitality be extended to the group and that they will be fed and given shelter.

She turns and follows her kin with the group piling on to the sled and following.

Over the next hour, the group begins ascending the mountain of Shatterpeak, with Meljir asking questions of the group in a deep rumbling voice.

A heavy snowfall begins and the wind picks up, obscuring the mountain and limiting visibility.

The climb continues and they leave the trees behind, only seeing snow and rock.  The sled has some trouble, but every time it slows, one of the giants gives it a push.

Eventually, the ascent levels out and the group sees their destination through the blowing snow.

Before them is a massive standing stone, covered in whorls and designs, and 200ft beyond that is a massive hall made of slabs of ice, tapering to interlaced points like skeletal fingers.

The massive hall looks large enough for twenty giants to be housed comfortably and around it are abodes of ice.

Giants can be seen going about their business and some stop to watch the newcomers enter.

Those closest note the sled and small folk.  Scowls cross many faces though none approach to make trouble.

The weather parts just long enough for Patches to see something up the mountain as they approach the hall and she pulls her spyglass from her pack.

She sees herds of giant goats on the rock faces, a few massive forms of Mammoths…and a colossal staircase cut into the mountainside, ascending.

  

Mimor and the rest of his family head into the massive hall, the group leaving the sled and following (after assurances from Meljir).

Megno follows, silent and apprehensive.

Inside the massive, cavernous ice hall, a huge bonfire "warms" the chamber in the center, massive tables of stone and ice set, flanking the blaze.

Meljir is asked if they worry about melting the place and she chuckles, explaining this ice would never melt.

Giants can be seen moving around, setting the tables and preparing for the wedding feast later that day.  Directing them is an elderly Giantess, bowed with age.

Sitting at the back of the hall, asleep on a large chair is an elderly male Giant, his beard reaching the floor, a mammoth tusk walking stick in his arms and wearing a wrapped robe of tartan secured at one shoulder by a massive silver brooch.  He is snoring softly, that is to say extremely loud.

The elderly Giantess turns to greet Mimor and is surprised to see the party.

Words are exchanged and the old matriarch addresses the party in common, welcoming them to her home. She introduces herself as Ingrbotha

She explains that their fight against the Gnolls must be repaid and invites the group to stay for the festivities that evening.

The group accepts.

The other giants of Mimors group are dismissed to recover from the travel, while Mimor stays to talk to Ingrbotha.

Meljir tells the party to follow her and they will be her responsibility.

They follow Meljir through the hall and into a side passage leading to huge chambers, sparsely furnished as massive bedrooms.  The group heads inside for some much needed rest.

  

Patches though, does not immediately head into the chamber, veering off to scout the hall.

Moving from room to room, Patches is not noticed by the several giants moving around, preparing for the feast (they have too much to do). 

Patches investigates, seeing some valuables, but they are all of giant size and not easily taken.

She swings back toward the group, but glances into the main hall and sees a huge, shaved-headed and mustached young giant arguing with Ingrbotha.

She watches just long enough to see Ingbrbotha slap the mustached giant and point out of the hall, at which point the clearly furious Giant storms away leaving Ingrbotha shaking her head.

Patches rejoins the group and finds them drinking with Meljir sitting on the bed in the chamber, watching the group and interjecting with the odd word.

Having gotten a cup from a shelf, Meljir pours herself some white liquid from a massive ice pitcher.

Curious, Cirrus asks what it is and is told "Eyrak", fermented Mammoth Milk and fruit.

Cirrus asks to try it and actually likes it a bit.  More than whiskey at least.

Tark tries some next and the strong liquor takes effect very quickly.  Buumi partakes next, then Gundren, Megno and as Patches rejoins the group.  She has some too.

Before long, the inebriated group is laughing and chatting with Meljir, bringing up Cercei, leading to discussing Buumi's inter-species romances (which gets a raised eyebrow).

Realizing that this is the first time he has seen Patches drunk, Tark decides to try and delve into her past and begins to ask Patches questions, with the rest of the group quickly jumping in to try and find out more about their enigmatic companion.

Normally tight-lipped, Patches seems to be in a talkative mood and actually answers some questions.

Her name is indeed **Alya Faen Tlabbar**.

She is the seventh daughter of **Matron Mother Vadalma** of **House Faen Tlabbar**, third house of **Menzoberranzan**

**Lo'Dan **is not the father of any child, but he did help Patches escape the Underdark.

She worked for **Bregan D'Aerthe, **Lo'Dan being her contact there, and operated on the surface for them for many years.

She started working for Lady Faye in Baldur's Gate because they were a "good fit".

The group chats for several hours, but they don't get much more from Patches and eventually, its time for the feast to start.

Meljir kicks the group out of her room so she can get ready and the group, still clad in their traveling clothes, head to the main hall to see what the night might bring…

  

Entering the main chamber of the grand Hall, the group sees a familiar enough scene, but on a massive and intimidating scale.

Giants sitting at two massive tables, eating and drinking and laughing.  It's the spitting image of any Northern rural party, just...enormous

Few of the Giants seem to take much notice of the group and those that do smile, avert their gaze, or scowl.  No one approaches though.

The group heads in to the party.

Patches keeps an eye out for the angry mustached giant and spots him with an entourage, drinking with the newly-wed Ljokjar.

Meanwhile, Cirrus, Gundren and Fey have engaged Ingrbotha in conversation and discover that there is a stone archway further up the mountain that the great stone stair avoids as the giants could not shape the stone eons ago.

The giants know there is a tower atop the highest peak but they can never see it directly, only ever seeing it out of the corner of their eye or as a mirage.

The group finds out that they are to climb the stair, get to a massive bridge, take it across to a plateau infested with Remorhaz.

There is a massive polar worm named Merrumjundr on the plateau.

The group figures that this is the archway they have been looking for to gain access to the Sanctum and thank the giants for the information.

Meanwhile, Buumi has continued drinking heavily and makes a pass at Meljir, who rebuffs him.

Patches approaches the group of drinking male giants, climbing up onto the table, slipping behind a mug of Eyrak and then being revealed when it is picked up to be drunk.

The giants reel back, surprised and taken aback by a Drow suddenly appearing, one remarking "see, I told you they can do that!".

The giants and Patches exchange words, Patches remarking that she is a warrior and the bald giant laughs, asking for proof.

The bald giant lets out a shout and it is echoed around the hall by many other voices.

The other giants begin filtering out of the hall, out into the snowy night and the group follows.

The giants gather, drinks and food being passed around and the giants then challenge the group to a series of competitions to prove their strength.

A foot race to the standing stone and back.

A drinking competition.

A Javelin throw

A wrestling match

Something called "The Cheese Sniff"

Patches leads the competition with the foot race against an unknown female giant who actually smiles at the group before the race begins.

At the sound of a titanic clap, the race begins and Patches zips off into the night, quickly outpacing the giant despite her massive strides.

Speeding through the snow, running atop it, Patches gets within 30ft of the stone, then misty steps to it and turns and sprints back.

Patches quickly returns, passing the surprised giant on the way back.

Her hair glowing with moonlight and looking leaner from the magic of her blade, Patches rushes back to the group, winning the race.

Meljir asks if any magic was used, as it would be dishonorable and…unfortunate. 

Patches says that she did not and the rest of the group sighs in relief as Meljir nods, convinced.

The giants are surprised but jovial and the giantess running the race makes it back in short order and congratulates Patches.
  

As the group congratulates Patches, two massive tusks filled with Eyrak are brought out and a pudgy giant steps forward to drink.

Cirrus decides that Selune is with him and steps forward to challenge.  The group grows nervous at the thought of the skinniest of them trying to outdrink a giant…

Cirrus prays to Selune for guidance and the challenge begins. 

A beam of moonlight breaks through the clouds momentarily and illuminates Cirrus.

The muscles in his throat relax and he literally pours the liquor down his throat, filling his belly almost instantly, but still he continues.

The horn is emptied quickly, no one knowing where Cirrus could possibly be putting it whilst remaining unaffected.

Cirrus wins.

The slovenly giant finishes his own tusk and looks over at his smaller opponent and grows agitated, moving as if to strike at Cirrus.

Before the behemoth can close the distance, the bald mustached giant delivers a blow to the drinkers jaw, decking him to the ground.
  

The next challenge is to throw ice javelins at the standing stone 200ft away, a challenge that Buumi eagerly accepts.

The huge, bald headed and mustached giant is the challenger, a giant named Suttung.

The ice javelins are brought out and the contestants take up position.

Buumi has a hard time hoisting the Javelins as they are so massive.

Cirrus however, moves off into the darkness a little and subtly casts levitate on the first one, just enough for Buumi to get an easier grip.

The first volley is thrown and both Buumi and Suttung hit their targets.

The second and third are both missed and so a fourth is brought.

The giant hurls, missing as Buumi's smashes into the rock and the giants roar in delight.

Suttung looks at the group coldly and then turns and just walks away into the night, most of his posse following him.
  

Next up is the wresting match and this time Meljir steps forward, looking for some fun.

Tark decides that he wants to test himself against a frost giant.

The match begins and Tark darts between her legs, going for the back of her knees as she tries to simply pick up her smaller opponent.

Tark manages to use his leverage to take out her knee, causing her to come crashing down and then jumping onto her back.

She grabs him and begins to squeeze, but Tark manages to push against her hand and then shrink down, using the sudden space to break free.

Meljir rolls and swats at him, forcing Tark to dodge and "fish hooks" her mouth.

Tark dodges, leaping into the air and coming down on her diaphragm with an elbow, knocking the breath out of her.

On the ground and stunned, Meljir lets out a chuckle, remarking that she clearly has had too much to drink and Tark is declared the winner.

After this bout, Buumi tries to hit on Meljir again, and is rebuffed once more.
  

It is time for the final challenge and the old patriarch of the tribe comes out of the hall, the old fellow with the huge beard, walking stick and Tartan sash - Aegir.

Eighteen wheels of cheese are brought out into the snow and the rules are explained.

The contestants are presented with three sets of three cheeses.  One in each set of three is good, the other two are rotten and after a cheese is picked, it must be eaten. 

The idea is that only by studying the rind and smell, could someone tell which to eat.

Gundren steps forward, being the foremost expert in foul smells that the group has.

Studying the first set of cheese, Gundren takes a handful and immediately smells the rank odor.  Eating the cheese proves to be disgusting and he almost vomits, but his Dwarven constitution sees him through.

Aegir also picked badly though and so the first round is a draw.

The next round they both pick correctly and both enjoy a good strong cheese.

The final round comes and Gundren picks correctly again, though Aegir picks wrong.

The giants laugh and shout, and the group is congratulated for their prowess.

Gundren and Aegir begin chatting about cheese and they return to the hall to continue talking and eating.

The night begins to wear on and more and more giants are passing out drunk or returning home.

The group heads back into the main hall but as they do, both Patches and Tark feel something watching them from out in the darkness.

Looking out, Tark sees an old Orcish woman walking through the snow and shadowsteps out to her, surprising the Orc.

Sharing a few words though, Tark quickly finds that this woman, Dregthana is here to deliver Rudgrub as a gift and they walk together back to the Hall.

The group settles in for a last round of drinks while Dregthana prepares pipes for any that wish it, quickly gathering several Giants around her to partake.

Megno stumbles in through the front doors of the place, completely drunk and collapses in a pile of furs, snoring almost instantly

Patches joins a few minutes later, as does Cirrus (with his Analgesic) and the group settles in to sleep in the main hall, warm under mammoth furs and near the burning bonfire.
  

The next morning, several of them awake with terrible hangovers and Buumi has to go around neutralizing the poison in their systems so they can continue in their search for the Sanctum.

The group rises, eating leftovers from the feast the night before and begin to gather their things.

They find Meljir passed out under one of the tables and nudge her awake, asking if she would guide them up the mountain.  She says no, but that the giants will keep their sled safe, and then goes back to sleep.

The group gathers their things and head over to a building that Megno points out as a stable.  Entering, they find a number of young Mammoth calves, the sled and the Moose being taken care of by one of the giants.

They decide not to take the sled though, Patches relaying that the giant stair they are heading for is maybe an hours walk from the settlement and the group leaves the sled behind.

Heading up the windswept mountain, a light snow begins to fall and the group makes their way to the stair easily with their winter gear.

Arriving at the base, they are greeted with an intimidating sight, that of 3ft steps that are 12ft wide and covered in snow and ice.

Sighing at the obstacle ahead of them, the group begins to climb the stair…
  

Climbing the stair is no easy task as it was made for beings far larger than humans or elves.

Ascending, they come across gaps 30ft wide from landslides and are forced to use the rope and grapples to get across.

Patches of ice must be traversed carefully with climbing gear to avoid slipping.

At one point, with a blizzard whipping up, a bolt of lightning discharges high above. The blast rains stone and ice down on the group, forcing Cirrus to create a wall of force to protect the group from the debris.

A heavy fog blows in and Patches goes out to scout to ensure they don't get lost as the stair becomes obscured by heavy snowbanks.

While scouting, Patches follows the steps without issue, finding a large archway half covered in snow that the stair goes around.

The group catches up and sure enough, after a thorough examination, determine the archway to be the one they are looking for.

Charging the arch with cantrips, the group passes through it and look to the peak of the larger section of the mountain.

As the clouds part momentarily, they see their destination now revealed to their waking minds.  A dark stone tower rises from the highest peak, encrusted in centuries of ice.

Continuing up the mountainside, a strong wind threatens to blow them off and the group is forced to tie themselves together with rope.

Nearing the peak of the smaller mountain, a massive eagle cry splits the rumbling snowstorm and the group hunkers down, hiding themselves as best they can.

Buumi slips, taking out Cirrus but manages to grab the warlock and roll into a snow drift just as a massive form circles the mountain - A Roc.

The Roc circles once more before moving off in a dive, snatching a bleating goat from the lower mountainside amidst the gusting snow.

The group continues on and they make the peak shortly, though the cold is beginning to get to them and exhaustion begins to set in.

Making it to the top of the stair, they find a massive bridge of ice-planks affixed by huge Iron chains leading across the gap in the mountain, over to the plateau of Merrumjundr.

Patches heads out over the bridge first, using her climbing kit and training to take a rope with her and affix it to the bridge. 

The group follows, using the anchored ropes to keep them safe, though there are several slips, no one falls more than 10ft.

It's slow and tedious, but the group makes it across the massive ice bridge.

Now on the plateau, Patches takes out her spyglass and spots several moving patches of snow and dozens of sets of giant bones.

Deciding not to mess around with a bunch of Polar Worms, the group enacts several spells of flight to simply bypass the plateau with several group members carrying the others.

Cirrus attempts to pick up Megno, but does not have the strength and drops the dwarf.  Tark swoops down and grabs the Dwarf and pulls him into the air just as a smaller worm bursts from the ground, snapping at the ascending Dwarf's feet.

Rising into the air, Megno is kept out of its biting grasp and the group flies across the plateau easily, Buumi towing Patches as she hangs on to a rope.

The group bypasses the 500ft plateau quickly and make to the other side easily.

From her vantage point, Patches spots a human sized staircase, immaculately cut into the mountainside and free of any ice and snow and the group swoops down, following it.

Moments later, the group lands in front of their destination, the massive black-stoned tower rising before them, cut into the mountainside atop the highest peak.

The wind howls fiercely and the blowing ice stings everyone's exposed skin.

A great black Iron door stands ominously in front of them, its stone frame covered in a thick layer of ice.

Fey and Megno begin casting firebolts into the ice, cracking and melting it away until the Iron door stands free…
