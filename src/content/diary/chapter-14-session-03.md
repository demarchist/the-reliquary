The group treks through the wasteland, making great time toward the ever looming High Plateau of the Northern Anauroch Desert

Their time in Alaskar has made this harsh terrain seem almost tame in comparison and lacking the second sun, the temperatures remain bearable

They leap chasms, traverse dangerous sands and before long find themselves nearing the base of the great cliffs

The group takes to the skies, flying and ferrying each other rapidly up the 500ft cliffsides

During the journey, they spot three great Vultures flying in to take a look at the intriguing group

Gundren shoots one out of the air and the others retreat

Tark calls on the power of his new arm and simply leaps the cliff in two or three bounds, flying up

The group finishes the ascent and they find themselves on the wind-blasted flat of the desolate High Plateau.

The wind is chill despite the blazing sun and the air is starting to get thin.

They continue north, in the direction they saw the Wyvern fly many hours ago.

JmJm jaunts to the Ethereal plane to look for Netherese remnants.

He spots many pools of dark shadow and thin planar barriers - The Shadowfell is close here, and many denizens have begun to bleed through into the Ethereal Plane.

JmJm does not remain long, unwilling to test his luck

Hours go by and a mass of plant life becomes visible ahead - a tangle of massive twisting, thorny vines.

Vines as thick as tree trunks and with footlong thorns, the mass seems unappealing

The scouts however stumble across another way forwards - a cleft in the stone, leading down into a canyon.

The group heads down into the fissure, finding deep sandy dunes filling the gorge and the walls strangely porous and holed

Buumi complains of some shoulder pain and Patches awkwardly tries to give him a bit of a massage - the Plate armor and height difference making it near impossible

The rest of the group, never having witnessed Patches attempt anything like this, are shocked and begin to playfully tease her

Patches immediately pulls back and then leaps back just as a voice calls out a warning echoing off the walls of the chasm and huge worms explode from the ground around the party.

Due to the called warning, the group manages to defend themselves and quickly drive off the massive Bobbit-worms long enough to rush onto a nearby rocky outcropping

They find a Bodouin adventurer sheltering on the rock; a lone survivor of treasure hunters seeking the Wyvern Graveyard themselves, a man named **Machmoud **and follower of **The Fell God **- the harsh aspect of Lathander in the Desert.

Warned of the waiting Bobbits, several of the group decide to try the surface of the plateau, while others fly through the canyon.

JmJm ferries Machmoud on Steden, though the man initially recoils from the Devil, he is convinced by the bard.

Patches climbs the walls of the canyon rather than risk the waiting worms, only to discover that the porous rock is porous due to the burrowing worms - the sand below likely ground stone from the beasts

One leaps out to bite her, but she dodges and decapitates the thing

Knowing she is still in danger on the wall, but suspecting the Worms will have a harder time seeing her, she climbs with renewed stealth and agility

On the plateau above, Cirrus is quickly spotted by the returning Vultures and fires off a volley of Eldritch blasts to drive them away

Gundren burns the Vines away with fiery blasts of his Thundercannon, revealing the cliff-edge

Cirrus attempts to make some headway through the vines but is attacked by the birds and almost knocked off the cliff and into the chasm beneath the great canopy.

Gundren opens fire on the Birds and looks for a way down below the great vines and sees many openings Arkto (or a wyvern) could fly into

The group moving through the canyon squeezes through a narrow section and finds themselves beneath the great vine canopy - the net growing a ceiling across a wide valley in the plateau with a trickling stream eroding the stone and scattered bones of long dead great beasts litter the area

They check for workable bone, but only find ancient, crumbling and gnawed on remnants

The water allows for a smattering of hardy looking plants and grasses, though the winds from above have filled the canyon with soft sand dunes

They have found the Wyvern Graveyard

Those above the Canyon make their way down beneath the canopy and join up with the others

They carefully explore, looking for the Wyvern that came this way - noting signs of some fairly large scavenger beasts and avoiding them by the water

They check down one particularly large box canyon and spot their quarry

A massive Wyvern, easily the size of an Adult Dragon sits near the water’s edge, resting it seems

It is looking at something even larger than itself seated against the back wall of the Box canyon - by a large cave opening

A gargantuan Cyclops with fiery red hair, boney Wyvern-scale armor and a massive flail of lashed Wyvern tails sits on a rocky outcropping

The great Giant is watching the Wyvern and the Ancient dying Wyvern is watching the Giant…

Machmoud swears and falls to his knees trembling with fear  

He names the great titan as **Borborygmos** - The Bone Hunter, a mythical figure to him and his people

JmJm looks on in wonder and leaps atop Steden, intent on charging toward these two great creatures of legend!
