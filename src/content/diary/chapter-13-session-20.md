The group settles in to rest, summoning the mansion while the camping group does their best to hide and conceal themselves

They hear some commotion out in the cavern and Patches investigates, finding a small group of the reptilian giant Wahid

As she moves around the area, she notes the biggest (standing on guard for the others) sniff the air and turn around, scanning the cavern

She notes their keen senses and tries to distract it by tossing a nearby piece of broken coral down a side tunnel

It distracts them momentarily but as she moves back to the group to warn them, she notes the big Wahid scanning the cavern again, apparently not fooled

Patches returns to Tark and warns him and the rest of the group and they debate doing something about the giant reptilians

They decide to leave them be, relying on stealth

Tark builds a makeshift blind and coats himself in coral and flora so well that even Patches has a hard time seeing him and they settle in for the “night”

After several uneventful hours, Tark is keeping watch and is startled to see one of the huge reptilians phasing through a nearby wall as if the very rock was no more than an illusion.

He stays perfectly still, watching

And the Wahid does the same, simply watching the area. For hours.

It eventually leaves, phasing back into the rock

Tark does not move

Sure enough, the things head phases out of the floor nearby and it continues to watch for another hour, before phasing back into the stone

It does not reappear

Tark “wakes” Patches and warns her and then rests himself.

The rest of the night is uneventful and the group reconvenes in the morning once the mansion spell ends.

They move out as a large, loud group and the local wildlife flees from the strange and alien sounds of foreign humanoids

The party investigates the area, determining the flow of the waters (Gundren even grabbing a water-skin of the holy font water and a Dust of Dryness bead of it)

Before long, they are trekking through the cavern, following the flowing water to its source - a small tunnel in the back ceiling, the area festooned with an incredible ecosystem and teeming with magic

Cirrus is impatient but the group sends Snorbul first to check out the magical tunnel

He does not come back and before long the group decides to all head in

Better together than trickling in one at a time

“*As you move through the crevasse you feel a steady incline in the tunnel.  Water flows across your boots and drips from the walls, making the ascent  difficult.  The cave is lit brightly with the bioluminescence of the Fawden empowered coral, which illuminates the smooth limestone oddly and the climb begins to take on an otherworldly feel.  Time stretches and feels like an eternity, only for the crevasse to suddenly give way. You crawl into a cavern, over a hundred feet in diameter with the living Avatar of a goddess at its heart suspended above a glowing pool. The cavernous expanse of living stone is illuminated by a purple aura of otherworldly energy. Small motes of glowing light drift through the too-still air, alighting on the rock before dissolving to water. Fawden sits at the center of the chamber; an alien tree spreading its roots up into the ceiling as its branches reach down, in a swirling mass.  Water drips from the body of it in a steady rhythm, falling into a massive basin of solid stone.  Wide and shallow and filled with eerily still water, broken only by the rhythmic drip from the Font.  The entire area makes your hair stand on end and your teeth hurt.  The smell of Ozone and Ammonia tinge the air.  The place hums with potent magics.”
*

They find Snorbul at the waters edge, entranced by the Avatar of Fawden

He snaps out of it easily and he asks how long he has been here and honestly, they don't really know

Cirrus pushes forward to the pool beneath Fawden, plucking a pearl of divine power from its waters (which only he can see) and then begins to instruct the group on setting up the ritual

They assemble the Ringed Veil and move it into the water beneath Fawden, ensuring that the ring of the Portal encircles the tree-like structure above it

They then carefully remove The Last Word from the bag of holding, careful not to touch it and move it into position with magic.

Cirrus then begins the ritual

Hours go by with Doc, Gundren, Feanon and Cirrus all actively channeling energies and building the intricate webwork of fractal spells

The others are not entirely sure what they can do to assist, so they begin to inspect the gate, checking for excess heat or malfunctions, or simply praying.

JmJm strikes up an inspiring tune and begins to wade through the shallows, circling and watching the ritual as backup in case someone has to drop out.

Hours go by and the ritual builds

*“The ritual continues and the energy builds ever greater.  The Word hovers in the center of the chamber; Ringed Veil laying on its side in the font of power. The artifact blazes with light, radiating like a tiny star.  The runes along the length of the Veil glow ever brighter and the gate is vibrating so powerfully that the pool of water is roiling. *

*The acrid smell of ozone permeates the air as energy discharges in great arcs from The Word to smash into the inner ring of the Veil.  A curtain of distortion emanates from the inner ring along its interior and extends in a cylinder up to the ceiling of the cavern, fully encasing the Avatar of Fawden. Great swirling patterns and designs, fractals of power and alignment twist and change, spiraling through the arcane motions of the ritual.*

* As the chanting of the ritual and the flow of energy being shepherded continues to build into the capacitor, it begins to take on a rhythm.  The ebb and flow of the power hitting the barrier of the Veil is like a great tide crashing upon the rocks. With each flow of the tide, it becomes harder and harder to shepherd. Heat begins to radiate from the gate as the massive energies its channeling begin to build. It is time. The ritual begins to turn the energies spilling from the gate and direct it.  There is only one place for it to go: Fawden.”
*

“*You corral the power and continue its flow, building to the inevitable crescendo. *

*Feanon begins inputting the address into the gate.  He waits, inputting each coordinate as the tide falls with the ebb of the ritual. As he waits for the right moment, his finger shaking, he inputs the final symbol. *

*	Cirrus, lets out an exclamation of pain, the scream turning to joy as liquid metal fills his eyes as his connection to Selune is strengthened.  Mercury flows from Patches forearm and the gracefully curving blade of Eclipse appears in her hand.*

*	The gate has not activated, there is no portal as the ritual spell suspends the activation to coincide with the killing of Fawden.  But a connection has been made.*

*The power of the Word rips at the ritual veil, throwing a cascade of colors and lights across the barrier.  The energy seeks an outlet and the barriers of the spell press against your mind and tax your body.”
*

A lot of heat is coming from the gate, too much to be normal and the technicians find a red-hot panel on one of the outer gates.  

They missed a Sapphire circuit!

Thorna takes her Icy Hammer and hits it with a ray of frost, cooling it enough for Gundren to suggest a fix

They take out the braided cord of precious metals they retrieved from the machina factory, engraved with arcane runes and they use it to bridge the circuit and freeze it into place, bypassing it and the ritual continues

A particularly violent burst of energy burns Gundren badly and he has to step back, JmJm stepping in to continue the ritual while Buumi heals his friend.


*“The power continues to build and steam rises from the font in ever growing quantities. The ritual continues and energy begins to coalesce and rise like molten metal, beginning to coat the body of Fawden with pure light.  The physical body shudders and the ground shakes.*

*Cirrus knows that mere minutes remain, the goddess is dying.*

*As you hold your hands aloft, channeling the great power of the gate, they begin to sting.*

*  The energies of the cosmic tide contained within the ring smash against the barrier, releasing energy with each pulse”*

A laugh echoes through the chamber, and you all see a dark form coalesce at the edge of the cavern, away from the light of the Font.  A humanoid figure, robed in dark shrouds of purple and black, floats a few feet off the floor against the dark stone wall, obscure.  A single glaring eye of purple blazes from the shadow and the voice echoes through the chamber, laughter in its words.

Vecna has come to investigate, having felt the ritual in its final moments.

Not realizing the group has The Word, he mocks them for their attempt to “save” Fawden

"This is futile, you lack the power!  You are lacking!  When she *dies *I will devour your souls as you stand in this place.  Feanon, so sad, but you had your chance. You..."

Vecna stops gloating 

having been watching the ritual he realizes the heart of the Ritual is The Last Word and a more powerful piece than he has.  And this changes *everything. He has miscalculated.*

*With a thunderclap, the figure swirls in on itself in a vortex of violent flame.*

*The ground shakes and an impossibly deep note resonates through the cavern putting pressure on your eyes and ears.  The fiery form of Vecna blazes with white and black flame and then streaks backwards, smashing into...and through the back wall of the cavern.*

*The energy leaves a growing, ragged hole of white-black flames devouring the very rock.  Through the blaze as it rapidly expands, a Gate has opened and you can see through to the other side.*

The group rushes toward the portal, unsure of its nature or where it leads, but they know it cannot be good.

The ritual at this point needs no more shepherding, it only needs time to finish executing.

Vecna’s Gate continues to grow…

*The dark expanse of the dead metropolis of Sharza stretches on through the portal, the view ever widening.  The limited visibility shows a plaza of ancient and ruined stonework, covered in silt and corruption, great statues of ancient saurian emperors line the thoroughfare, their majesty tainted by a  millennium of darkness. 500ft away is the foot of a massive structure.  The sky roils and dark clouds are illuminated by flashes of purple lightning striking the sides of the gargantuan edifice.*

*Tark recognizes the massive expanse of the Great Pyramid.  An obsidian mountain. Around its peak, great winged forms can be seen wheeling, and turning toward the newly formed gate as a titanic rumbling emanates from the storm above.  A massive skeletal face begins to form in the storm, with a single glowing eye that focuses down on you. You feel the pressure of that gaze as all its will turns toward the widening Gateway.  The city is lit by flashes of lightning and a wailing howl begins to rise like a gale.  Figures can be seen turning toward you; a legion of undead through the shifting storm-lit sands.  *

*The horde surges forwards, hearing their master’s call as rank after rank of skeletal Saurians form up into a phalanx of ancient shields and firelances, a mass of ghouls surge forward. Wraiths and spirits flit through the sky and dive for the gateway as larger things can be seen rising in the dark expanse of the city.*

*Flashes of light erupt from the monuments and structures lining the thoroughfare.  A storm of Firelance shots from every wielder within range, including dozens on the footsteps of the pyramid.*

*The fusillade of shots lacks in accuracy but makes up for it in sheer fury as sparks and fire shower the cavern in a cone from the gateway.*

*A pulse of energy erupts from the Font as Fawden exerts what little will she has left to secure her allies.  A mirage-like barrier before Vecna’s Gate and the Firelance shots begin to smash into it in a furious shower of sparks. But the gate continues to grow, and the city of the dead is called to arms!*

*You see spirits and shades, skeletons and zombies, ghouls and great winged beasts rush toward the portal and smash against the barrier of Fawden.  The firelance shots aim higher to avoid the crush of foot soldiers, but they cannot get through.  Dark forms move through the press of undead as stronger forces are marshaled.  They approach the barrier, and infused with the Dark will of their god, push forwards to cross it…
*

The group quickly moves to defend the Gate (creating a wall of ice to funnel the physical enemies) as a Saurian Mummy Lord, glittering with gold and glowing with Sourcestones approaches Fawden’s barrier with a retinue of saurian mummies.

Empowered by Vecna, the long-dead lord raises a desiccated hand and the barrier falters, allowing a vanguard of skeletons, wraiths and spirits to pour in

The vanguard meets the group in a clash and are slaughtered (the wraiths proving the most troublesome).

They killed dozens

Untold thousands remain beyond the Gate 

The Mummy Lord and his Retinue charge forwards, another vanguard of fodder leading the way before them…
