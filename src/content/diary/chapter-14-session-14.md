The group parties and carouses until around midnight, when exhaustion finally overtakes them and they retire to their lairs.

“In the morning, The Group heads East…”

Or not.

Cirrus is interrupted from his quiet, yet fervent yodeling by awareness of a threat

He detects an entity moving quickly toward the town from high in the sky

Cirrus races to the roof, sure that it is the Dragon returning for battle

The entity however swerves sharply north after flying above the main town and leaves the area.

The sleepy and post drunken revelry of the predawn calm is shattered by a series of small impacts across the town of Selunia

It takes a few minutes for the impacts to be found as it is so early in the morning, but several of those that find them begin to scream in horror

Cirrus sends out Topsy to find out what is happening

Patches bolts from the Establishment and races toward the cries

JmJm hears the commotion and ever so slowly starts to awaken and get dressed

Feanon is made aware of the commotion, scries on the site and decides to head to town

Patches gets to one of the scenes just before Topsy and sees a splatter of gore across the street

She sees enough material for it to be several people, likely having hit the ground at high velocity

Its left quite a mess, and taken out a nearby structure wall

Doc B arrives with JmJm who saunters up atop Steeden

The others quickly arrive and discuss the happenings as the Town Guard cordon off the “bodies”

Its clear this was retaliation by Ancalagon the Dragon for his defeat and the group suspect that these could even be people they know, though Cirrus maintains the Dragon only got close to the Barony once since his defeat.

It is likely that these civilians are travelers or frontier folk

Doc does point out that he thinks that one particular “splat” consists of someone dropped, and someone hit

The group all agree that this Dragon needs to be put in its place

JmJm then points out that if Ancalagon is to the north abducting folks to drop on town, he’s likely not at home at his lair

Cirrus thinks he may know where the Dragon lairs and has Doc Wind walk the Group

They rush south, knowing that Ancalagon could return at any time

Cirrus leads the group to The Withered Hill

They quickly scout the place and determine it to be guarded by the Goblin survivors of the battle

Cirrus Polymorphs into an Adult Black Dragon and drives them away, melting a few for good measure.

Patches spots one or two holed up, peeking from the tower.  She snipes them with her new crossbow

They scout the area again and determine themselves to be alone

They then begin to search for an entrance to the suspected lair.

Cirrus opts to scout the surrounding waterways of the Marsh and finds a particularly deep crevasse with a spring issuing forth, feeding the bog from below

The crevasse leads deep beneath the Withered Hill but is uncomfortably narrow for an Adult Dragon to squeeze into

Cirrus opts for Patches to scout ahead and the Drow Rogue dives into the foul waters

She manages not to get sick from any of the stuff and then uses her new Drow Matron abilities to Alter Self

Her fingers become longer and webbed. Her feet too. Her eyes get a protective film so she can easily see and her ears elongate and fork out into a web of gills

She easily swims into the crevasse and into the spring font

It is a network of tunnels and the flow of the water makes it challenging to navigate, but after a few short minutes, Patches finds a set of massive claw marks in the rock and follows them up into a dry chamber

She stealthily slips from the water and notes a huge amount of tangled roots and vines

She notes several move toward her, unfolding and showing glistening venomous needles 

She moves back into the water and submerges, heading back to the group

Patches makes good time and returns, telling the Group of the entrance to the suspected Lair

Cirrus, in Dragon Form, swims back with Patches

The others follow in the Ethereal Plane astride Steeden

They move through the submerged tunnels, Cirrus having to squeeze awkwardly through the tight confines

He makes it to the chamber with the vines and moves casually out of the water

The chamber is large enough for the Dragon to move comfortably, but the vines and roots all leap out to tangle Cirrus

They are strong enough to give him trouble if he lets his guard down.

Cirrus also notes that they are covered in poison

He opts to be careful and begins to rip and tear the plants to shreds

As the last of the vines are shredded, Patches moves out of the water and approaches Cirrus in his Dragon Form

Cirrus looks down at his companion and gets a strong urge to rip her apart and feast on her flesh

This disturbs him and he decides to end the Polymorph

In the Ethereal Plane, the rest of the group find themselves beset by ghosts and shades

They rush through the dark haunted tunnels of the fissure in the Ethereal Plane and then dive out into the Chamber and leave the Ethereal Plane

But not alone

Feanon begins to clutch his head and whisper streams of seeming nonsense as the Ghost possessing him takes control of the new body

They recognize the danger and quickly banish the possessing spirit back to the Ethereal

With everyone assembled in the tunnel entrance, they cautiously move into the tunnels

They spot skittering off in the dark tunnels and catch a glimpse of black scales - Wyrmlings

They begin to spot more ancient stonework as well as hundreds and hundreds of bones littering the floor of the place 

They note the stone here is scored and marred as if by dozens and dozens of talons and pocked by acid burns

They hear Goblin voices up ahead and Patches disguises herself and adjusts her form to pass as a servant

She moves forward and quickly finds the Goblin slaves - all marred with sickly looking acid burns and old wounds, they skitter to and fro with their heads down and take no notice of the disguised Patches

She has free run it seems and she quickly maps the place, finding a cache of eggs, a Goblin Barracks and the main chamber of the lair off of the small complex of tunnels, all large enough for an Adult Dragon to move around (and marked with melted stone to prove it)

The main lair is a bowl shaped room, ancient stonework forming a dome of rock above an area excavated by the dragons to create a massive nest

The place is packed with gold, silver, gemstones and items of every sort

There are also two Adult Black Dragons curled up on the Gold, with several smaller wyrmlings nearby sleeping

She spots an Iron cage across the chamber with several humanoid forms within

The nostrils flare on one of the dragons and twitches in their sleep.

Patches backs off to report her findings

The group comes up with a plan

They will bomb the eggs to lure the dragons out of the chamber, then charge into the treasure room, collapse all the entrances, Demi-Plane and shovel as much gold inside as possible with Bigsby’s Hand and then Teleport home to Selunia.

Patches sneaks out to set the bombs and the group moves into position, moving through the complex of tunnels and avoiding or killing the Goblins in their way

Patches sets off the bombs and the Dragons bolt awake, roaring and tearing their way out into the tunnels toward their eggs

The group dashes into the lair and enact their magics, shovelling treasure into the hole as fast as they can

They open the nearby Iron cage, finding a handful of unfortunates that had been kidnapped from nearby roads and villages as food

Cirrus begins popping Eldrich blasts into tunnels to collapse them and the Dragons can be heard fast returning, realizing they have been played and roaring with Fury, shaking the tunnels

Clawed hands gouge the stone of the remaining tunnel entrance

A black horned, skull-like dragon head snakes its way into the chamber, maw agape and dripping with acid 

Feanon teleports the group away in a flash of light…
