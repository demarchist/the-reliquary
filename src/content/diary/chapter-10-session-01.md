The group stands there in Entemoch’s boon, looking over the artefacts.

Behind them, Gurnik enters the chamber, accompanied by an elemental.

He gestures to the artefacts, saying that the Gnomes want the group to have the two on the altar, but a third was found by the Gnomes when they came down here before the group and it is worth looking at together.

Curious, the group follows Gurnik and heads back to Blingdenstone.

Despite the victory over Juiblex being so fresh, even now, Gnomes and Elementals can be seen pushing out into The newly open wing of the ruined city.

Making it back without issue, the group is led through the city, Gnomes bustling to and fro, putting together caravans to head into the newly safe city sections, eager to move in and secure them  before other things do.

Gurnik leads them to the Chiefs residence, approaching the large Svirfneblin structure and ascending the wide steps.

The group enters and finds the great meeting table of the Gnomish leaders to be covered in scrolls and books and at the tables center is a massive Diamond the size of a dinner plate and a good three inches thick.

Fascinated, the group moves in to take a look; Patches and Grundren pulling out jewelers kits, Snorbul touching the thing and remarking that its warm, while Cirrus checks it for sigils and Feanon begins to identify the thing.

Dorbo and his wife, Senni, remark that they have no idea what the thing is other than old, covered in ancient Gnomish script and has several gods older symbols across it.

Indeed, as the group is told this, they note the gods mentioned across its surface: Selune, Elistraee, Mystra, Callarduran, and The Stonefather.  

Seeing Selune’s symbol on this artefact stokes Cirrus’ interest and he begins to study it intently.

The examination continues but the thing seems to defy identification, the best the group can figure is that it is some kind of spell “scroll” and is a focusing lens for the ritual.

The Gnomes then turn the conversation toward treaties and written allegiances, and negotiations begin for regular trade and a potential alliance.

They hammer out the following:

Twice a month a caravan will be teleported to and from Blingdenstone consisting of twenty gnomes.

The gnomes will mostly be wererats, making the trip to see the full moon or returning from a stay on the surface.

A chamber will be made specially to be shielded from wild magic to ensure the safety of the trip, Dorbo will begin on the summoning circle on their end in that chamber.

The Gnomes will bring with them 12,000gp in Gemstones, trading at cost, for things like food, Wood or even labor to assist in the rebuilding of their city and the strengthening of their borders.

After pricing in the goods being sold to the Gnomes, the Barony nets about 3,000gp in Cut gemstones a month to then be divided as the Barony rulers see fit.

Additionally, the Gnomes mine salt, which is a far easier purchase than having it shipped from the Anauroch by the Bedine.

The Gnomes will supply the Barony with 500gp of salt for free a month.

**The Barony gets:**

**3,000gp in gems**

**500gp in salt**

**Taking the Gemstone Lens Artefact to the Barony for further study**

**The Gnomes get:**

**A mutual protection pact with Selunia**

**Access to the Lens once it has been figured out**

**Bypassing Mantol Derith and Gracksuluth for Trade, relieving a great deal of financial pressure on the Gnomes (one being run by Duergar, the other by the Zhentarim).**

Cirrus says that the preliminary treaty sounds good and he will have Magistrate Li go over the fine details and have it formally notarized by the High Courts of Silverymoon.

This concludes the negotiations and the group leaves the Diggermattock residence to discuss their next plans.

They have the key to Gravenhollow and Feanon says that now he has it attuned they need only spend the night out in the wilds for the Library to come to them.

Tark is anxious to continue on the Gravenhollow but upon hearing that they HAVE to wait, he reluctantly agrees to head back to the Barony.


The teleport is quick and painless with the destruction of so many demons around Blingdenstone sealing many of the planar fissures.

The group appears atop Feanon’s tower, looking out across the sunlit barony in the spring morning air.

The group then heads out and about for the day, each with their own plans.

Tark,Gundren, Patches and Snorbul all head into town, to Over the Moon with Gundren peeling off to check out his workshop.

Thorna and Cirrus go to see Beryan the Sage and Feanon goes to check on his apprentice **Ruthir**.


The apprentice is working away diligently, but is completely stumped by the damaged Ring of Spell Turning having no idea how to fix the cracked gemstone and restabilize the magic within.

Feanon takes a look over it and checks the students' work, it's accurate for the most part and Feanon corrects a few mistakes.

An enchanting medium is going to be needed to fix the Gemstone in the ring and Feanon thinks that the ancient Prismeum that they recovered from the Netherese Sanctum might do the trick.

He has **Ruthir **start some equations and then heads to the lab, to the Cloning Facility.

The clone is growing well and nears maturity.  Indeed, when checking the Philotic connection, Fea finds it to be strong and healthy and the clone seems to be lacking in degeneration or defects.

The wizard smiles at his progress…


Cirrus and Thorna meanwhile have found Beryan downstairs in her office by the tower library.

The sage is taking notes from an ancient text as they come in and she greets them warmly, mentioning to Thorna that she has found some information on the goddess Auril.

Beryan goes on to explain that Auril is the goddess of the harsher aspects of winter: storms, darkness, cold, predatory hunger and the like and is NOT a nice goddess, the clergy frequently extorting people in exchange for “milder” winters.

Additionally, there is some theological debate about other “mantles of power” the goddess might hold; such as being the Lady of Winter in the Unseelie Fae court. The being known as Princess Maeve and the daughter of Mab Queen of Air and Darkness.

Cirrus grows impatient and interjects, though Beryan is all but done and Thorna has a great deal to think over, leaving the tower and heading into town.

Cirrus turns to his sage and then hands over the silk-wrapped Gemstone Lens.

Beryan is in awe and excitedly begins to go over it, grabbing a magnifying glass and a notebook.

Cirrus points out the markings of Selune as well as passages of ancient text he cannot make out.

Beryan goes to an old holy book to Selune, a book of ancient legends and myths and begins flipping through it, stopping at a page and showing it to Cirrus.

The symbol on the page is an almost exact match for the one on the Diamond Lens.

In the book, the Symbol is used in reference to something called **Moonfire:** “Called down from the heavens, the light of the goddess did coalesce and the Moonfire engulfed the offering and with it great works were wrought by the faithful...”

Cirrus’ eyes go wide and his NEED to find out more only intensifies, he has Beryan focus on this project above all others.


The others make it to town uneventfully, Gundren peeling off to go up to the Keep while the others all head into the Tavern.

Snorbul spots both Wartigers enjoying the hearth and he decides to go over and try and pet the giant beasts again.  He notes that they are definitely looking a bit bigger and more muscular than before, strange…

As Patches and Tark head toward their regular table, Mr. Pickles approaches.

He tells Patches that their honored guest is out by the Eastern gate, by the newly constructed walls.

Patches thanks the Goblin and then comes clean to Tark, telling him that Mordenkainen is in the Barony and that he was hiding here for a few days.

Tark is unsurprised that Patches kept this from him but is excited to see Stick again nonetheless.

The two of them decide to head along the road to the gate to see the archmage.

They walk through the idyllic town center and head along the road, easily spotting the new wall circling the Barony.  

The progress is astounding, having only been under construction for a week or so.

The speed of construction becomes clear as they approach and spot Mordenkainen levitating above a section of the wall, telekinetically assembling the stone slabs and bricks into a wall which is then sealed and finished by a Team of Dwarven masons.

An entire second team is dedicated simply to hauling more material to the site a Mordy makes quick work of the available materials, quickly assembling an entire section of wall.

The Archmage is a little surprised as Tark appears next to him, flying through the power of his staff.

Both Stick and Mordy greet the Monk warmly, the monk hugging him (and noting his legs are tiny) and they then drift down to the ground to chat.

Mordy thanks the group for their hospitality, mentioning that his legs should be fully regenerated in another day or so and in the mean time, he will do what he can to pay the group back for their hospitality by creating the wall for them.

He also has set up in a suite in Over the Moon and is paying very well for the service.

Mordy heads back into the sky to continue his work, leaving Tark and Patches who continue out the gate and along the road as Tark thinks he smells Buumi and Li approaching and he spotted a carriage on the road while he was up in the air.

Patches and Tark talk as they go, Patches asking Tark who she should ask to teach her son wizardry after they save him: Feanon or Mordenkainen.

Tark says he’s worries about how powerful Mordy is, that he may have lost touch with reality a little as interplanetary Archwizards probably don't care, or won't do much for the little guy.

Patches agrees, but has similar worries about Fea.

Tark goes on to say that if she wants her son taught properly, Feanon is the one to do it and its all of their job to keep Feanon grounded.

Patches agrees just as the carriage draws close, slowing down as it approaches the well known duo.

Buumi and Li get out of the carriage and greet their friends discussing the recent events.

Li mentions that in 3 weeks there is a debutante ball to be hosted in Silverymoon and all of The Heralds are invited with Cirrus as the guest of honor as a new lord in the area.

Indeed, the intent of the ball is partly to find the Lord a bride.

Buumi manages to extricate him and Tark back to the relative privacy of the carriage.

Inside, he tells Tark that his family has surprised him with a betrothal to some noblewoman in Neverwinter, he doesnt even know her name.

It is to be formally announced at the Debutante ball.

Tark asks about Patches and Buumi responds saying he doesnt know, its all so confusing and Tark agrees.

Patches, Li, Buumi and Tark all then head back into town.


Gundren meets with his craftsmen who are now fully settled and he briefs them on the upcoming competition in Gantlgrym (happening over a month from now).

The workshop is up and running well and the experts are fully settled.

The Manufactory is finally ready to open for full business.


The group relaxes for the rest of the day, meeting back up at Feanons tower in the evening.

The wizard then teleports everyone back to Blingdenstone and they head out from the Deep Gnome settlement, into the wilds of the Underdark once more.

They head out, putting as much distance as they can between themselves and any semblance of civilization.

They make good time, passing a field of Shockgrass and the Rothe living there and find a good potential campground for the night.

They climb up into a crack in the ceiling of the tunnel and summon a Tiny hut and Magnificent mansion, ensuring their security for the night.

They retire, exhausted but excited for what the next day will bring.


They awake the next morning.

Tark and Patches hear it first, a rumbling and strangely modulated moaning or singing.

They move in to investigate, heading up the tunnel to a point where it widens almost to the point the “tunnel” becomes a cavern.

There, against one large wall is an archway of carved stone, opening to a crystalline stairway large enough to easily allow two giants to walk down it abreast.

They also notice that all the mineral deposits in the area are noticeably more defined and impressive than the day before and atop one such outcropping is the source of the strange noise.

A Basilisk is singing.

It notes their approach and greets them in a rumbling voice, introducing itself as **Veldyskar, **a resident of Gravenhollow sent to escort the group into the library.

Tark and Patches fetch the rest of the group and they eagerly convene at the start of the massive glittering stairway.

Veldyskar leads them and they begin their lengthy descent.

The group questions the talking basilisk, asking about Gravenhollow.

They discover that the place is a demi-plane of earth, not unlike Barovia was a demi-plane of shadow.

This one however, the entire plane is an entity - Gravenhollow, attended to by three Stone Giant librarians.

While the adage of the library holding all knowledge is true, it’s more theoretical.

There is a chamber of past, present and future and the librarians scour them for information relating to the giants and their civilization.

Therefore anything related to giants is meticulously recorded, everything else is recorded at the librarians leisure.

Due to the strange time dilations of the library, all information can eventually be found here, it just might take a long time…

The staircase finally begins to level off and the group sees the tunnel open up before them, refracted light cascading and reflecting from the crystalline walls.

The tunnel opens into a massive cavern, kilometers across with a massive crystal pillar connecting the floor and ceiling in the center.

At its highest point, the ceiling of the massive geode is at least 500 meters, sloping down to the exterior walls of the place at around 40m.

It is so large that the other side is lost to the haze of atmospheric perspective.

The light is brilliant as it appears that much of the crystal within the geode is emitting light and reflecting off of the many mineral deposits of the area.

Before them, is a roadway of crystal, the plane going straight toward the main pillar, from this distance, a great gleaming door can barely be seen in the column.

The group, in awe of the place, begin their trek across the crystal planes of the geode toward the library.

Around them, the place is a bustle of natural activity, with small elementals rumbling along or living crystal motes floating in the air.

The group asks what lives out there and the Basilisk says the biggest thing to worry about are the worms, but their docile enough if not bothered.

Patches spots movement in the massive crystal stalacmites above, there’s some kind of large winged creatures up there.

It takes the better part of an hour, but the group finally makes it to the heart of the demi-plane, the crystal pillar that constitutes the library itself.

As the group approaches, the great brass doors of the place are flanked by two massive Stone Golems.

Each depicting a stone giant and clad in golden jewelry and bangles, their great stone gazes watch the group approach, making no effort to hide their animated nature.

The brass doors swing wide, each large enough to dwarf even a giant, and open to reveal the foyer of a massive stone complex.

Made of black marble and threaded with veins of natural crystal and precious metals, the interior is of a classical greco-roman design, yet scaled to a being far, far larger than a human.

The titanic architecture dwarfs the current occupants of the foyer and the group takes in the bustling sight of the place.

Earthen Galeb Duh bustle to and fro, many carrying crystals of various colors, some glowing.

Veldyskar mentions that they are archiving the crystals.

The other occupant of the space is sitting in a lounge of sorts, a collection of comfortable looking “small-folk” scaled furnishings near a roaring fire.

The Drow male sits there, gazing at the group as they enter, a smile curling at his lips.

The group takes note.

They ask Veldyskar how to get around and the Basilisk says to touch any vein of ore or crystal and simply ask the library, it will take care of their needs.

The Basilisk then touches a vein, and a doorway appears through which Veldyskar leaves.

Tark immediately touches a vein of gold and asks to go to the archive of the future.

A tunnel appears and he heads down it.

Cirrus asks for accommodations and a tunnel appears for himself.  He heads down it.

Thorna and Snorbul immediately head to the Archive of the Past, intent on finding out about her origin.

Buumi, Gundren, Feanon and Patches are looking at the Drow.

They approach and the Drow stands and bows slightly and introduces himself as the Archmage Vizerion DeVir.

Feanon looks at the wizard and notes that the features are familiar, the group then introduces themselves as The Heralds.

Patches remembers that House DeVir was destroyed centuries ago by the Do’Urdens.  This wizard has probably been in exile for a long, long time.

Feanon finally place the features and remarks “Elion?”

Vizerian smiles and nods, he mentions that indeed, he knows Feanon from his time in Silverymoon in the guise of Elion, Feanon’s mage colleague.

Patches looks to Buumi and gestures away and the two of them head to the chamber of the present.

Cirrus finds himself in a perfect replica of his rooms in the barony.

Astounded, but seeking answers, he touches a vein of ore running through the wall (the only thing out of place in this otherwise perfect replica) and asks for the archive of the Past.

Tark exits the tunnel and finds himself in a large natural cavern, the raw rock threaded with raw gemstones and lines of precious metal.

At the heart of the cavern, a massive amethyst chandelier of crystal descends from the ceiling, a hundred feet overhead.

The Amethyst is shedding and raining crystal shards that float to the cavern below where they are caught by a bustling army of Galeb Duhr, the crystals glowing like falling stars.

At the lowest point of the crystal heart of the library stands a Stone Giant, clad in crimson robes and Gold bangles.

With a rumbling voice, the giant turns its bald, grey head and affixes soft glowing emerald eyes upon the monk.  They crinkle with a smile.

“Welcome Tarkothy Daaru of Vaasa. One of The Heralds. I have been expecting you.”
