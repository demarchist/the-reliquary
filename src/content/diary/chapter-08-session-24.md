Claudine & The Alchemy shop

Patches looks at Claudine and nods slightly, confirming the old womans suspicions.

Claudine's eyes go a little wide and she turns to Zella, ordering her into the backroom.

The young half-elf sighs but does as she's told.

Patches poignantly doesn't ask about the parentage of the girl, but does ask if she has any contacts still in Faen Tlabbar.

Claudine is nervous and asks to walk and talk, and doing business as her boss will be angry if she just chats.

They move around the shop and Patches peruses, buying several potions and receiving them in a nice box.

Claudine tells Patches that no, she has no contacts in Faen Tlabbar, but she does have information.

They will meet after the third day's work shift, at the Slave Quarters of the Muzgardt clan, a set of barracks and apartments near by.

As they hash out the details, a Duergar woman approaches - **Seke**, the owner of this store.

Seke immediately tries to order Claudine to start polishing the metal counter-tops as she spots some corrosion and tries to take over the conversation with Patches.

Patches is taken aback and immediately says she has nothing to say to Seke but was talking to Claudine.

Seke's face contorts with anger before she gets it under control when she notes the Dragon badge, but asks that Patches leave, immediately.

Patches leaves and hears Seke screaming at Claudine as the rogue walks away to find the rest of the group.

The rest of the group has been getting a tour of the Brewery after pretending to be high-rollers looking to engage in trade.

They get a lot of information, seeing the Cave Fisher stables, the creatures harvested for their filament for Beer and Alchemy.

Snorbul is very intrigued as his family bred Cave Fishers as guards for the city, he had no idea they could be used this way and resolves himself to try and start a ranch.

The group also discovers that Muzgardt currently trades with the Zhentarim in Mantol Derrith which is then brought to the surface.  Any other surface deals must go through the Zhentarim (or match the bribery clause).

Patches meets up with the group after they exit the Stables and they all head to get tastings of the many potions.

In the masterfully crafted bar-like area, the group sees many kegs and barrels behind a countertop of pure gold.  A strange spiderlike contraption whirs behind the bar, serving drinks and small tastes of potions.

The group is interested and remark that it does not look like its of duergar make.

The Duergar confirm and instead say that a Gnome engineer named **Dr. Hojo Finklespark, Inventor Extraordinaire **was responsible for the work of artifice.

They then inquire about pruchases a large supply of healing, and other potions, but when told the price, make excuses and leave.

Fey complains they are cash poor and Patches cocks and eyebrow at him.

Patches tells the group she has an appointment later in the day but her tasks are currently done.

They head back to the townhouse.** **

The Townhouse

Pulling up to the Gholbrorn's lair, the group exits the Rickshaws and heads into the foreigner's Complex.

As they walk over to the elevator to take them to their floor, they spot a young Duergar hustling toward them with a long black box under his arm.

They recognize **Hemeth **and the Duergar gives them a hearty hello and tells them that he has their order, gesturing to the box under his arm.

Understanding that Hemeth has information for them, they all head up to the Townhouse and the relative privacy of their rooms.

Once inside, Hemeth lets them know that the box is just Pastries (the group chows down) but that he has information for them:

**House Baenre of Menzoberranzan trades with Zhentarim to the north at Mantol Derrith, but no one has heard from the outpost in some time**

**They have found someone who knows the personnel on the Golem Sale; a Drow Agent of Bregan D'Aerthe named Shin.  He is one of the guards of the Drow Embassy and disguised as a Mizzryn guard. He can get the group a name.**

The group thanks Hemeth and he takes his leave.

The group then discuss what to do next in the city, and if they should even remain.

They deliberate and decide to head to Caingorm Cavern and speak with the Ston Giants about **Gravenhollow.**

Cairngorm Cavern

They head into the city, getting Rickshaws as usual (with so many trips now, several wait nearby).

As they leave the Darklake district and head into the Duergar section, a scuffle on the market edge catches their attention.

They watch as a group of five Derro all pull weapons and attack a lone Duergar Merchant.

They bear the man to the ground, hacking and stabbing with abandon.

In their single-minded bloodlust they don't even register when three Duergar Stoneguard all come out of invisibility and begin to cut them down.

In a matter of a few bloody seconds, six corpses lay bleeding on the street.

The rickshaws trundle on.  The group does not stop.

Crossing the great furrow that divides the city, the chemical and industrial chimneys belching a thick stream of smog into the air, the group comes to a strange juxtaposition.

A set of massive, natural stone doors covered in intricate whorls and carved knots.

Sitting out front of them is a Stone Giant with a hide wrap made of a massive red lizard.  A menhir stone sits next to him.

The giant smiles down at the approaching group and rumbles a greeting.

No one speaks Giant, so he then looks at Patches and continues in Undercommon.

After a brief conversation, the Giant knows they are visiting at the behest of **Dorhun**, the partner of the dead mutant from the day prior. 

The giant touches his massive club and the whorls light up, matching the massive door and with a rumble, they slowly open.

The group leaves their Rickshaws behind and begin down the massive, natrual limestone tunnel ahead of them.

Large enough for two giants abreast, the group feels dwarfed by the massive natrual landscape, the place glittering with mineral deposits.

It has a clean smell to the place, neither dry nor humid and it feels clean and cared for. 

The natural shapes seem molded and indeed, it feels much like a Japanese guarden.

They see several giants tending to the cavern and Snorbul approaches one and asks what he's doing.

He does not respond at first.

Patches, loving the place asks if she could meditate here and the giant is amicable.

They find that the massive creatures are rather slow of purpose and dismissive of any of the smaller races.

They don't get much from the gardener and continue on, making it to the main chamber.

The noise of a waterfall fills this place and the massive Limestone cavern shines with reflected water.

Several giants can be seen sitting in this place, washing clothes, gathering water or relaxing.

The bright light source in the chamber, casting the reflection, lounges down by the water's edge.

A Radiant figure, shining with Dawn light, notices the group and sits up, showing a slender Eladrin-esque appearance, though a massive seven feet tall; A Summer An Sidhe.

The Radiant being calls out to the group just as Cirrus begins to freak out.

Already uncomfortable by the proximity of this place to the Fae Wilds, coming face to face with an Archfey unsettles the Warlock immensely.

The Sidhe calls out in common, naming many of the group and saying that he wishes them no harm and indeed promises it under the **Guest Rites** of the Fae (Binding word).

Cirrus begins to walk away quickly.

Patches catches up and after a brief conversation, Cirrus takes a massive hit of drugs to calm his nerves and heads back in.

The radiant figure introduces himself as **Araele The Dawn Knight**, one of twelve of the **Summer Court of the Fae.**

On guard, the group begins to interrogate the Dawn Knight while giving up little of their own purpose.

They gather that Araele was drawn to the Prime Material by accident when **Hgraam **summoned a Fire elemental recently and the portal expanded.

Being nearby and hunting the same elemental in the **Plane of Fire**, the Knight was drawn into the same portal by the unstable cracks in the cosmos.

He is now trapped in Cairngorm Cavern as he would need an invitation to leave into the greater city (much like a Vampire) and only the King, or similar noble can grant such a thing.

**The King and the Lairds** have not responded to any of the messengers sent by the Stone Giants. Odd.

He offers to buy one of the Dragon Badges, or gain an introduction to the dragon himself.

The group is cagey and they begin to negotiate from a place of strength, realizing that Araele needs them desperately.

While the negotiations are happening, Patches notes the cubby that the Archfey cut into the stone while staying in the cavern.

The cuts are ridiculously sharp and precise, like the cubby had been cut by the same thing as Bilrigger's Sanctum.

Returning, She asks the Dawn Knight about it and he draws his sword.

Appearing from a blazing scar, a huge weapon appears into his outstretched hand.

The underdark dwellers all hiss in pain as their eyes are burned by the flash and several giants swear and move away, muttering.

Snorbul looks them over and approaches one.

Araele introduces the Fae Blade, a monstrously powerful type of weapon of which few exist and even fewer exist that are without a current master.

The group puts it together and realize that Bilrigger's sanctum was attacked by a wielder of one of these blades when Araele swears he has not left the cavern.

The negotiations end with a few offers and counteroffers: **A scroll of Planeshift** or an introduction to the **Lady of Summer** and being taken to the gates of the **Bifrost;** the road to **Ysgard and the domain of Selune.**  All this in exchange for his freedom.

Meanwhile, Snorbul chats with the nearby Giant and discovers that Araele has been a headache for them to deal with.

A stone giant approaches from one of the nearby tunnels, heading toward Snorbul.

The huge giant, with a crown of crystals and cloak of moss introduces himself as **Hgraam**, leader of the Giants here.

The group take their leave from **Araele**, saying they will think it over and head to join Snorbul.

The giant offers them some information on Gravenhollow, confirming that with a crystal key, the library can be drawn to the wielder.

He also confirms Snorbul's suspicions that half of that key resides in **Blingdenstone**, having been given to the gnomes many eons ago.

The giant speaks a cryptic warning of the dangerous powers growing in the Underdark and that the very caverns quake.

He gives the group his half of the key to Gravenhollow and implores them to seek out the Library.

The group take the large crystal and turn to leave Cairngorm Cavern, unsure how to deal with the Summer Sidhe and Patches needing to make her evening appointment with Claudine.
