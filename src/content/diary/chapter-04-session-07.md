The group waited at the labyrinth wall, unsure of what to do next. Patches felt something wrong and caught movement near a pool of bog water. She donned her Piwafwi and crept over to investigate. A small, angry old man — deformed, with an enormous red cap and iron shoes — burst from behind the foliage. More Redcaps erupted around the party from every direction, stabbing with barbed hooks and dragging people across the ground.

## The Redcap Ambush

The group rallied quickly, throwing up healing spells and buffs and turning the surprise attack into a slaughter of Dark Fae. Mid-fight, they realised the Redcaps were a distraction — the window for entering the labyrinth was closing. Thinking fast, the group charmed one of the surviving Redcaps and forced him to lead them to the real door. They made it through with moments to spare. On the other side, the dim labyrinth stretched away in every direction, its walls covered in moss. The Redcap's charm wore off and he bolted.

## The Lost Wagon

With no better plan, the group began exploring. After a few twists and turns they came face to face with an enormous boar the size of a buffalo. They braced for a fight, but the boar spoke — it was searching for its mate and the wagon they were supposed to be transporting. Relieved to avoid another battle, the group agreed to let it tag along.

Deeper in the labyrinth, the boar recognised a section. The group found a large chamber containing the lost wagon and a glowing red crystal pulsing with energy. Tark walked in first and was repelled by a powerful psychic force that gave him a splitting headache. Doctor Breakfast warded herself and Fëanon entered wearing his protective hood and Ring of Mind Shielding.

Examining the crystal, Fëanon and Doctor Breakfast determined a fairy was trapped inside. They decided to smash the crystal and set it free.
