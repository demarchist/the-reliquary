Out front of the massive labyrinth wall, the group stands around, unsure of what to do.  Patches begins to feel unease and looking around, catches some movement off on the shore of a pool of bog water.  Deciding to investigate, she dons her Piwafwi and heads over.  As she nears, a small angry looking old man, deformed of proportion with an enormous red hat and Iron shoes leaps from behind some foliage.  As he leaps out, several others leap out around the party and attack.  With harpooned hooks, the Redcaps stab and drag the party around dealing vicious wounds.  The group quickly forms a defense and begins laying out their healing spells and buffs, quickly turning the surprise ambush into a slaughter of the Dark Fae.  During the fight, the group realizes that the Redcaps are a distraction and that they are missing their window for getting into the Labyrinth.  Thinking quickly, the group charms one of the remaining Redcaps and has him lead the group to the real door.  The group (and followers) makes it through with mere moments to spare.  On the other side, the group finds themselves in a dim and massive labyrinth, covered in moss.  As the group looks around, the Redcap makes a break for it as the Charm had worn off.

Not knowing what else to do, the group begins exploring the Labyrinth.  After a few twists and turns, they come face to face with an enormous Boar the size of a Buffalo.  Readying themselves for battle, the group is pleasantly surprised when the Boar asks for assistance in finding it's mate and the wagon they are supposed to be transporting.  The group, happy at avoiding a fight, agrees to let it tag along and keep an eye out for it's Wagon.

Devling deeper, the Boar claims to recognize a section and sure enough, the group finds a large chamber, inside which is the lost Wagon, but also a large red, glowing crystal.  Tark walks first into the room and is repelled by a powerful psychic force, giving him a terrible headache.  Not wanting to take any chances, Doc B. wards herself and Fey enters with his protective hood and Ring of Mind Shielding.

Examining the room and crystal, Fey and Doc B. think that they determine that there is a fairy trapped in the crystal.  They decide to free it and smash the crystal...
