## The Journal and the Half-Orc

The group lingered at Madame Eva's camp, turning over the implications of the Book of Strahd they had found in the Vistani cart. Returning to investigate the wagon further, they discovered a loose floorboard hiding a suit of leather armour, daggers, and poisons — the kit of an assassin, though whose remained a mystery.

A half-orc bard named Gerwan approached them, another stranger trapped in this cursed land. He had been with the Vistani for about a week and was delighted to see other travellers. He asked — with considerable enthusiasm — to be taken along, though he also mentioned that having lived with the Vistani, he would feel obliged to tell them if Patches kept what she had found. Reluctantly, Patches "returned" the items.

They questioned the guard whose family owned the wagon. She claimed the Book of Strahd had been given to her family to safeguard many generations ago — she knew nothing of its contents, only that if Madame Eva wished the group to have it, they could take it.

## The Tser Pool

The group headed along the river toward the main road, arriving at the pool at the base of the waterfall — the same pool Mordenkainen had supposedly fallen into during his failed assault on Strahd. The water was ominously dark and still. Something lurked beneath.

They formed a plan. Fëanon strode forward, staff raised, and conjured a churning maelstrom in the centre of the pool. The water trolls were caught off guard, dragged into the vortex and pummelled by the spinning current. Two managed to briefly escape, but Buumi, Gwen, Gerwan, and Patches drove them back in with a flurry of attacks. Patches webbed the thrashing creatures in place as Gundren's thundercannon and her crossbow bolts hammered them from above. The group then threw grease into the whirlpool, set it ablaze, and summoned a cloud of whirling blades at its centre. The trolls were shredded and immolated in short order.

With the pool clear, they searched for any trace of the Archmage. All they found was an iron-wrought wand — a wand of lightning bolts, presumably Mordenkainen's.

## The High Road

The group circled the pool and began climbing the ancient moss-covered stairs carved into the cliffside. The ascent was steep and treacherous, slick with moisture. They helped the mounts up the worst sections, with Chekov and Ireena picking their way along. A few slips earned bruises but nothing worse, and after a long climb they reached the high road — a thousand feet above the pool, with an old stone bridge guarded by gargoyle statues behind them.

They sat down for a much-needed rest, with Ireena standing watch. The valley of Barovia spread out below them in all its grey, miserable splendour, the road to Vallaki winding through the mist ahead.
