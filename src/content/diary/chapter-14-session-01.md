The group finds themselves in the middle of town on a hot summer's afternoon

festival decorations for High Sun, the Summer festival of Lathander abound, giving the group *some *idea of how long they've been gone for

Wounded, bloody and exhausted, most of them shuffle into the nearby Establishment

Calls go up from the townsfolk of "They've returned!" and word begins to spread that the Faerun Defense Force is back

JmJm splits from the group, trotting Steden dramatically over to his Theater and throwing open the ornate front doors with a boom and cawing of Ravens

Inside, he finds the local actors rehearsing but screams at them to get out

All scramble to leave, save one, who is unceremoniously tossed by the Arcane Hand into the seats, he then hobbles out of the Theater

JmJm slumps into his "throne" in the center of the stage and begins to think....and then write...

Meanwhile, Cirrus addresses the gathering crowds in the Town square.

Everyone else heads into the Establishment for a much needed drink, but when its noticed that Snorbul is barely breathing, they quickly relocate from their booth, to the dark Gambling den beneath.

As they head down the steps, into the smoke-filled den, they hear a raucous good time they are about to disturb.

Sure enough, the place is filled with Deep Gnome traders from Blingdenstone

Patches tells them to get out, and recognizing the war-weary Drow, they quickly scoop up their winnings and scatter - leaving a good sized Ruby as a gift for their "gracious" host.

Mr Pickles is summoned from the walls and told to go and alert Magistrate Li that the group had returned.

Tark gives Pickles a bone knife from Alaskar before the Goblin leaves and notes Tark's dismemberment by poking at it

Buumi rummages through his pack and pulls out the prosthetic crafted for him by Gundren and hands it over to Tark who adjusts the fitting and puts it on

The hand is a bit oversized for the halfling, but it will work for the time being

The alchemist; Claudine (who had been summoned) and Doc B then begin working on Snorbul and before long the beleaguered Svirfneblin is awake and feeling better - though still missing limbs...

Claudine welcomes Patches back home

Feanon has his acolyte's summoned and while everyone is waiting, they have food and drink brought to them by a new bartender - a human man named Jackie

Jackie mentions that the town is experiencing a bit of a culinary boom with the influx of refugees and exotic meats being brought in from the Evermoor by Bolg and the Orcs

He brings a selection of pies from Ivan, the local baker, including Giant Eel which is surprisingly good

They relax for a while, propping up Snorbul and ensuring he can eat and drink with his one remaining limb.


Across the town square, JmJm storms from his throne to the front doors of his Theater and casts them wide

A flock of Ravens caw and take flight as he spins and nails a huge roll of parchment to the front door

He then stalks back inside.

The doors close and the parchment rolls open

The nearby crowds (and indeed, crowds have gathered hearing the FDF are back) surge forward to read the list

It is a Cast list for JmJm's new masterpiece...


Magistrate Li arrives from the Keep and walks down into the Gambling den of The Establishment, a part of it she has never set foot in before

She sniffs at the seemingly permanent smoky haze and lets out a polite little cough and greets the group

She confirms that the group has been gone for a little more than four months.

In that time the Barony has doubled in size from taking in war refugees

this includes a contingent of High Elves from Myth Drannor fleeing the rumblings of war with The Netherese of Shade Enclave

The previous front in the war has shifted as the city of Scornubel has fallen, though seemingly to a cataclysm unrelated to either side in the war - Maximus Maximus and his team are investigating and due back in some days

The new front is the Heartlands around the city of Elturel as the Northern forces have been pushed back toward the coast

The Amnians and Thayans are currently doing well

To reflect the growing importance of The Barony, Li has been given 150 parcels of land to divvy up and get producing food as a vassal of Silverymoon with the blessing of the local Moon Elves

Gundren asks how his lads have been faring in the Manufactory 

Li informs him that they have received numerous orders for larger scale extra-dimensional latrines for the armies - a secret weapon of a sort - less disease and less time digging traditional latrines

The Dwarves have also been managing two firearms a month

Additionally, several metallic boxes have shown up around the Barony of intricate metalwork that no one seems to be able to figure out

The group thanks Li for the information and she heads back to the keep

Gundren wants to continue celebrating their return to Faerun and has his brothers come pick him up in the auto-carriage. 

He invites Buumi to come partying with him and the Paladin gladly accepts and they head out from the Establishment

Snorbul is taken home to his hole by Doc who then heads to his Grove

Tark heads out to his treehouse, looking forward to sleeping beneath familiar stars again

Feanon's carriage has arrives and he is greeted by his acolytes - His nephew and the Mage Ruthir. 

He then heads to his tower.

Patches, now alone, turns to head deeper into the maze of tunnels beneath The Establishment, heading toward her sanctum

Three secret doors in, she finds a familiar face waiting for her - The Bregan D'Aerthe agent; Lo Dan

The annoying Dark Elf greets her with outstreched hands - showing no weapons - and a cocky grin

Tired, but with a soft spot for the plucky rogue, Patches lets him speak

Lo Dan explains that he's here on a job from Jarlaxle himself - he's here to spy on Patches and find Finn for her mother; Vladalma

Patches resists the urge to gut him right there and he clearly feels the tension so he explains - Jarlaxle cannot refuse a job like this from a Matron Mother, but offers the info up front due to their professional relationship 

Patches understands his nature as a double agent and tells Lo Dan to get out

He smirks and leaves

Patches then heads to her sanctum to pray and rest

And to begin plotting to kill her mother...


Feanon arrives to his tower as the sun is setting

The place is immaculate and he sighs in relief at being surrounded by such good taste once more

He greets Giuseppe at the front desk, which is piled high in unopened mail and packages

The Gnome seems somewhat uninterested and casually mentions that he and Uira are heading out in the next few days as their work in establishing the Teleportation circle is finished

Feanon summons unseen servants to begin ferrying his mail to his quarters (much to the frustration of his Nephew who had been doing it by hand)

In his chambers, Feanon goes through the mail, finding that most of his orders to the Manufactory for his cloning vats have been fulfilled

Amongst the packages, he finds a large leatherbound spellbook

He begins to read it, finding a somewhat elementary textbook on basic spellcraft

Though boring and already known, Feanon finds himself lost in reading the tome and several hours go by without him noticing

When he finally closes the book, a wave of exhaustion washes over him

He turns back to the book, now concerned and finds the tome vanished...


JmJm heads through the twilight to visit Doc B, he needs more drama and asks the Druid to create a thunderstorm that evening

Doc asks the plants when they last had a good storm and finding out it was some weeks ago, agrees to a good Summer storm

With the rain pelting down, JmJm rides Steden across the lake to Feanon's tower

He turns Ethereal to bypass the wards and enter unseen.

As he enters the tower in the Ethereal plane, he spots a baleful singularity of energy emanating from Feanon's lab

Feanon, traversing down in the foyer, is shocked by the sudden appearance of his Bardic friend (who had snuck up on him) and resolved to harden the tower against Ethereal jaunts

JmJm says he is there to discuss the Netherese and their history and they retire to the Reading Room to discuss arcane lore


The next day, Buumi is awoken by a knock on his door

He opens it to find Patches, who walks in

Badly hung over, it takes Buumi a little bit to catch on to what she's saying

Patches wants Buumi to take care of Finn if anything happens to her, and she will do the same for Cercei - this has been promised before

But Patches suggests that they make the promise binding in the eyes of both their noble houses and their gods - she proposes Marriage

Buumi is shocked and really not feeling well, but he thanks her and says that he has to think about it when he's in a proper state of mind

Patches agrees and then leaves


Tark awakens in the forest near his Dojo

Having heard from Li that someone is teaching "Tark Kwon Do" at the place, he decides to go check it out as they're probably a really good fighter

As he walks through the forest, glad to be away from the scorching heat and dust of Alaskar, a flash of light blinds him momentarily and a small blonde Asian lady appears next to him and punches him in the face

As he falls to the ground and looks up at the tree canopy, he sees a blue Dragonborn descending from the boughs to strike

Tark takes the whallop and then retaliates, dropping a globe of darkness over them all

He's splashed by water and he then knocks the Dragonborn to the ground, stunning him

The lady backs out of the Darkness and Tark follows with strikes and sees that she has a vial of water in one hand and she looks a little confused

The Dragonborn and the lady relent their attack, promising an end to hostility, especially after taking a few hits from the Halfling

They are Minnow (the dragonborn) and Goro (the lady) and they hail from the Bloodstone lands

They are disciples of Renfir - an old friend of Gaddock's and were sent after hearing tales of Tark the Shadow Monk

They feared that Gaddock's student had turned to darkness - like his master now has

They relay stories of brutal murders across the Bloodstone Lands: of nobles and wizards standing against Zhengyi, slaughtered in the night and of King Frostmantle of Vaasa signing non-aggression treaties with the Lich and his Thayan allies...

The few witnesses to the murders describe Tark's old master: Gaddock, emaciated, red eyed and pale. Vanishing into the mists...


Feanon and JmJm are awoken by Coffee brought to them by the Unseen servants

Feanon is still exhausted though and explains to JmJm what occurred with the tome the night before

This jogs an old memory; a story from a previous age, of a dark Witch King that send out Tomes of Creation to unsuspecting wizards who were then ensnared and consumed by them.

The tales talk of the tomes slowly killing the reader and growing structures from their life force

Tales of the Witch King Zhengyi and his initial rise to power in the Bloodstone Lands…
