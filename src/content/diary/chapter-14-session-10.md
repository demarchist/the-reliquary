Gundren arrives at the Establishment and demands a report, sitting at a booth with the group as they argue about what to do next

The group lays it out for him

Gundren downs a nearby pot of coffee and hops back to his feet.

He has one of his Dwarves go to the keep and sound the call for the civilians to shelter there.

They go for the kids

Whatever is to the north is the biggest threat and turning the kids back is on the way

The group agrees and leaves standing orders to defend the Barony and not to pursue any hit and run attacks.

Bohd, Maximus, Ruthir, Gneiss, Miranda, Chani(when she’s back), Ezmerelda, Jin, Surtr, and Bolg will defer to Doc B and act as the core of the defense

The party gathers their mounts and gallops North with great haste.

 As they ride, they hear numerous thunderclaps ahead in the Southern Moonwood

They slow as they reach the peak of the Red Hill and continue cautiously

JmJm and Gundren, atop Steeden, shift into the Ethereal Plane

JmJm and Gundren see a massive black orb in the sky of the Ethereal Plane backlit by a halo of Orange

A massive umbilical of undulating mass descends from it directly into the shadowy and indistinct forest ahead

All around they feel the chill of the Shadowfell and dark things move ahead just out of sight

JmJm shifts back and warns the group, something terrible is ahead.

Tark turns invisible, wrapping shadow around him from the overcast skies and flies up into the spattering rain to try and get a better look while Patches scouts ahead with her invisibility cloak

In a wooded dale, they spot a large clearing with a massive structure 

Easily 60ft tall, a massive squat Ziggurat of some kind of black crystal dominates the clearing

Four domes of matching crystalline darkness dot the main level of the thing

As the scouts watch, they see a beautiful red-skinned man in a leather legionaire’s skirt with rippling muscles and roman sandals

He wields a large and ornate looking poleax

His face is distinctly Hobgoblin save for the two curling horns protruding from his forehead

A Devil, and he holds the bloodied and bruised form of Chani by her limp wrist

She twitches, unconcious

Patches moves in to get closer, beginning to ascend the steps of the Ziggurat

She notes a depth to the crystal, swirling with mist lit by an occasional faint orange tinge of static

She freezes as she realizes she can hear the breathing and shuffling of several other people nearby

She scans around, seeing only the domes of crystal

As she does this, the Devil above casually tosses the ragdoll of Chani at one of the domes and she sails inside unimpeded…

Focusing on the sounds within the dome, she realizes that the people she hears are soldiers lying in wait inside Tiny Hut spells, similar to what Cirrus has made in the past

She turns and sneaks back down the steps and returns to the group just as Tark does

These Devils have Chani hostage and likely the missing youths and Menriel the elf

More concerning is the Ziggurat and what JmJm spied in the Ethereal Plane

They must attack and conquer this foe

As they talk, Patches spots a low flying form over the nearby trees and points it out

A Goblin Batrider is skimming the trees and heading straight for the clearing with the Ziggurat

Tark turns to the group and tells them to back him up and then shadowsteps to a nearby tree and launches himself into the air at the batrider

He knocks the goblin from the mount and then wrestles control of the giant bat

He casts a minor illusion over his face and rides the skittish animal to the ground at the base of the Ziggurat

Before Landing, Tark does the best he can to disguise himself

The Devil atop the stairs smiles at him with a knowing smile 

The creature looks like an adonis of a Hobgoblin, but wrong.

The cheek bones are too high and sharp, the lips too plump, the muscles too bulging, teeth too bright and perfect

He is a caricature of beauty

Bucephalus addresses Tarkothy Daruu

Seeing that the gig is up, Gundren opens fire and the group charges in

The first few shots slam into the Devil in a shower of sparks just as he introduces himself as Beucephelus of the Doomstar Legion

He flexes his muscular form and each section flashes to muscular sculpted metal armor and the bullets have no effect

The Devil charges forth at Tark and smashes him with the poleax

A Thunderclap booms as the thing strikes the monk and he is hurled back and down the steps of the Ziggurat.

Bucephelus then calls “DOOMSTAR LEGION! AAAASSEEEEEEMBLE!”

A dozen Devils, similarly clad in muscular sculpted gleaming metal armor appear next to their leader, arrayed in a dazzling choreographed pose of gleaming light and rippling abs, all wielding tower shields and poleaxes

The group must avert their eyes or be dazzled by the infernal display of power

The legion then charges forth but their charge is halted by a hypnotic pattern that appears over the battlefield.

The group attacks

Buumi dashes in on his wings as JmJm flanks wide with Steeden, summoning his Arcane Hand

The Paladin makes the steps of the Ziggurat, shrugging off a volley of Eldritch Blasts

Patches races forward and then dives into cover, taking out her new crossbow and making it sing

Feanon moves forward steadily calling on defensive magics to foul anything thrown at him, just as several Thunderous Javelins are hurled at the group, each hitting with a thunderclap and hurling the target backwards 

the magical Javelins then reappear in the legionnaires hands.

Seeing Patches sniping from cover, Feanon hastes the rogue.

Four Doomstar Battlemages step from their shelters and unleash four Sickening Radiances to bathe the battlefield in unholy light

The entire party redirects their fire at the appearing spellcasters and two are driven back almost immediately, taking massive damage

The other two see their comrades near death and step back into their shelters quickly, but not before unleashing a wave of magic missiles into Cirrus to break his concentration

Bucephelus calls out to the Warlock, telling him that he has seen his father recently in Hell, as a Lemure.

His anguish is particularly delightful

Cirrus calls back seeing if they can buy off these Devils, to which Bucephelus responds “only if they have 666 innocent souls they are willing to part with”

Tark strikes at the Legion commander and they engage in a dextrous duel of lightning fast strikes and resounding thunderclaps

JmJm charges in from the side and Bucephelus vanishes with a boom, throwing Tark back 

The Devil reappears directly above the charging Bard and strikes at him with his hammer, putting the Bard on the defensive

Bucephelus cackles, saying that he’s been visiting a number of fathers recently, as he just saw JmJm’s father languishing in confinement the other day

Tark recovers his feet and seeing JmJm’s defensive flourish, shadowsteps to his comrade to assist.

Cirrus feels the same extra-planar pull from the Demi Lich and resists it

Gundren fires shot after shot from the cover of the nearby woods and has Gwen stalk in, keeping an eye out to hit the Spellcasters as they duck in and out of cover

The Devil Legionnaires shout and teleport next to one another again striking the infernal pose and covering one another with their shields 

Feanon sees the grouping and unleashes a Deep Slumber over the area

Several fall to the ground, asleep as their companions rush to wake them, only to find the lingering enchantment sending them back to sleep, or causing others to succumb

The battle rages around the dark crystal Ziggurat, as the Devils defend the vile structure…
