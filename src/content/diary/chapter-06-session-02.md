## The Bridge Aftermath

The Dwarven patrol pushed forward to greet their saviours, taking in the sight of the group as the adrenaline of battle faded. Gundren immediately drew the majority of his kinsmen, who crowded around to ogle his equipment. Gebbin Steeltoe, the patrol captain, fell into easy conversation with his fellow dwarf, naturally assuming him to be the party's leader. The wagon arrived at the bridge shortly after — Cercei and the Rockseeker brothers in tow — with Patches trotting up astride Kitty and Mr. Pickles pulling his cowl low, trying to look inconspicuous behind her.

Cyrrus tended to the newly revived dwarves, bringing both back to consciousness with blessings from Selûne. Buumi rose wearily from his own efforts and stumbled over to Aurora, hauling himself into the saddle. Gebbin turned to one of his officers and had the all-clear sounded on the patrol horn, then ordered his troops to prepare an escort. They would take the group into the city and treat them to a feast at the Hopping Hair, the military tavern in the Undercity. Before departing, the dwarves butchered the dead hill giant with practised efficiency — Gebbin proclaimed that nothing tasted better, as it was essentially a sixteen-hundred-pound pig. The patrol finally managed to settle their excitement over inspecting their heroic saviours, and the column turned to cross the bridge into Sundabar.

## The Walls of Sundabar

Ahead rose a fortress the likes of which none of the group had ever seen. A massive fifteen-metre stone wall encircled the city, seamless until the light caught the surface just right and revealed stonework only achievable by dwarves or gnomes. A moat fifty feet wide lay at the base, spanned by fortified bridges at several visible points, each one a fortress in its own right. The walls were a bustle of activity, some sections still wrapped in scaffolding from ongoing construction. At one point, a crane atop a great tower hauled a huge metal siege engine into place — an ornate dragon-headed weapon, possibly a cannon. Smokepowder artillery pieces lined the ramparts every couple of dozen yards along every visible stretch. Sacked by orcs, dragons and Drow only two years prior, the reconstruction was staggering.

Gebbin chuckled at the looks of awe on their faces. Fëanon and Tark both inquired about the dragon-headed artillery and were told they were flame-spitter cannons, capable of putting a Red Dragon to shame at three hundred yards. Tark begged for a demonstration and was flatly refused.

The group entered over the fortified Rauvingate Bridge, past dozens of plate-clad sentries and beneath hundreds of watchful Dwarven eyes. A trio of clerics rushed out to attend to the wounded but quickly noted that those covered in blood were not as hurt as they appeared. They thanked the group for saving their kin and retired to a nearby tower for a beer. At the main gates, the craftsmanship left Fëanon puzzled — he had visited Sundabar before, and though it had always been impressive, nothing had approached this. He inquired and learned that the city was now linked to the Dwarven capitol of Gauntlgrym by a magical gate, through which all manner of help and trade flowed freely. With that connection, the city had rebuilt into something far greater than before. Patches spent the time scouring the gates themselves, trying to calculate their worth, but gave up when she could not even comprehend the value of the adamantite and mithril portal.

On the far side of the walls, however, the Uppercity was still very much in ruins. The streets had been cleared of major debris, but the buildings remained as the orcs had left them. Having poured everything into fortifications, the dwarves were only now turning attention to the rest of the city. Shanty towns had sprung up in the old neighbourhoods — survivors, refugees and opportunists policed by the Dwarven lords. Patches noted several signposts marked with Thieves' Cant and made a mental note of one particular shanty town. The group also passed the old Temple Plaza, where four cathedrals dedicated to Waukeen, Helm, Ilmater and Lathander stood derelict — massive edifices of shattered stone now open to the sky.

## Descent to the Undercity

The group approached a fortified section of roadway and saw a huge square hole cut into the ground — a cargo elevator flanked by two steep ramps descending into the Undercity of Sundabar. The entrance repeated the incredible fortifications with one addition: a Cleric of Moradin scanning everyone who wished to pass. Nora, the cleric, stopped the group at once, her gaze settling on Patches and Fëanon. She could feel evil radiating from them and asked to see their artefacts. After examining the cursed items and satisfying herself that the wielders were not the source, she asked them to be careful and not start anything. Gebbin vouched for them, as did her own brother Gillyd Rockseeker, who confirmed that the party had saved every member of the patrol.

After twenty minutes of descent, the tunnel levelled off and the group arrived at the gateway to the Undercity — specifically the Military Training Ward, or the Beardless Brawl Hall as the dwarves called it. Gebbin pointed out that these tunnels had withstood a year-long siege, and looking at the brown-stained rock, the hundreds of arrow slits, murder holes and collapsible ceiling sections, nobody doubted it. Fëanon's hands started sweating.

Through a second set of fortified gates, the group emerged onto a terrace overlooking a grand subterranean hall. The din of practice battle hit them almost as hard as the smell of unwashed dwarf. A vast chamber stretched out before them, its ceiling held high by massive regular columns. Between the pillars rose buildings, terraces, practice fields, barracks and forges — all bustling with activity. Uncounted magical flame torches lit the ward without smoke, casting a warm glow that matched the pervasive underground heat. At the back of the chamber, two great braziers illuminated a set of glittering golden doors leading to one of the Clan Vaults.

## The Hopping Hair

The caravan veered down a side avenue and arrived at a large inn and tavern — the Hopping Hair, its sign depicting a bouncing beard. The group parked the wagon, leaving Mr. Pickles, the wartigers and a detachment of the patrol to guard. Fëanon expressed concern about leaving their treasure exposed, but Gebbin assured him that after the group's heroics, his lads would protect it with their lives.

Inside, fifty rambunctious dwarves were already deep into their cups. The common room heaved with bodies and serving girls weaving through the crowd, delivering flagons of ale. Seven large firepits dominated the centre, each with a pig turning on a spit. Gebbin bellowed that he had brought giant to a round of cheers, and the hill giant meat was hauled to a free pit to begin roasting. The group was ushered to a large open table and food, ale and good cheer flowed freely.

Tark and Cercei ate ravenously. Patches ate her fill quickly and retired to a back table where a handful of seedier-looking dwarves were smoking opium from a hookah, joining them for a time. Everything was happy and calm — until Tark noticed a fighting ring in the back and stumbled into it, half-drunk.

A cheer went up. A dwarf lumbered out to challenge him and the two exchanged a flurry of blows, both taking wicked hits, but Tark grabbed the dwarf by his beard, hoisted him off the ground and slammed him back down, knocking him out cold. The tavern erupted. Coin changed hands and the betting pool was on. Buumi headed over to check on his friend and found himself in the ring opposite the halfling. Cheers went up and Buumi shrugged, smiling, and they began their bout. Buumi hit like a truck, but Tark struck four times for every swing — with one hand tied behind his back to even things out. Seeing things turning against the monk, Cyrrus and Fëanon conspired: the warlock cast a spell to muddle Buumi's mind, having bet on Tark to win. After a final exchange, Tark remained standing and Buumi was laid flat, though it was desperately close. The monk retired from the ring to thunderous applause and hauled his friend up for more ale.

## The Sloppy Sahuagin

While the revelry continued, Patches slipped out. She walked the long climb back to the surface and the Uppercity, finding the shanty town she had noted earlier. Following Thieves' Cant markers from shadow to shadow, she made her way to the Sloppy Sahuagin — a dive bar in the seediest part of town. Under the guise of her moon-elf persona Stitches, she entered the smoke-hazed joint and was immediately accosted by a drunk who tried to put his hands on her. She dodged, grabbed his thumb and snapped it. His friend lunged and caught a kick to the head. The bar paused to take this in, then turned back to their drinks.

In the back room, past a curtain and a fat bouncer who waved her through after a password, Patches found a card game in progress. She recognised her contact — Abalaba the Gnome, a Xentarim agent. Patches called her out and Abalaba excused herself, beckoning the rogue to a secret back room. Inside, Patches revealed her identity and discovered that Lady Faye and the organisation had believed her dead. She confirmed who she was and checked in with Lady Faye through a magical quill that could write across vast distances.

Abalaba sold Patches her Source Stones, mentioning that many were enjoying the powerful stones but that supply had grown unreliable of late. Patches also picked up a Bolt of Dragon Slaying and purple worm poison. On her way out, Abalaba pressed a magical quill into her hand — a way to stay in contact and place future orders.

## Ravenloft's Bounty

Patches returned to the Undercity and found the group deep in conversation with a cluster of Dwarven craftsmen who had heard that a powerful band of adventurers had entered the city and come to trade. Cyrrus negotiated with the lot, whittling down the competition until four dwarves remained, each paying several hundred gold for the privilege of perusing the group's wares the following day.

The group retired for the evening, renting rooms in the Hopping Hair. Everyone slept soundly save for Buumi, who woke in the middle of the night drenched in sweat from nightmares of Barovia and found no more rest.

The next morning, Patches rose early and made her way to the Everfire — the heart of Sundabar. The sound of hammers and a wash of sulphurous fumes met her as the temperature climbed. A large circular chamber served as the hub of the Undercity, and at its centre lay a shallow pit two hundred feet across and twenty feet deep, filled with bubbling lava. Dozens of forges ringed the pit, drawing on its intense heat. Dwarves in fabulous suits of armour — looking more like living golems than flesh and blood — scraped precious metals from the lava's surface with long skimmers. Buildings carved into every surface of the chamber rose in a sphere of workshops, housing and storage around the molten core.

Patches found an industrious forge and showed the smith her revolver, asking for bullets. The dwarf was astounded at the mechanical device and offered to make the ammunition for free in exchange for a schematic. Patches obliged, and the forgemaster implored her not to show the weapon to anyone else. She tested the new bullets, creating an almighty ruckus, but between the forgemaster's word and her own persuasive skills the guards were convinced it was merely an experiment.

Returning to the tavern, Patches found the common room transformed into a marketplace. Dwarven craftsmen filed out laden with goods while Cyrrus sat behind a large ledger, tracking inventory and gold. The excess treasure hauled from Ravenloft was finding eager buyers. Up in their rooms, the group looked upon their piles of newfound wealth and the possibilities it represented.
