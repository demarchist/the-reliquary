The group rallies as the Ghostly Giants swoop down to attack

The giants cut at the group and let loose blasts of icy wind

Cirrus is struck twice before managing to banish his assailant.

The group retaliates and destroys the last of the skeletal giants and then methodically destroy the ghosts one by one.

Eventually, only the banished Ghost remains and the group gathers around where it will return.

As its misty form appears, the group attacks.

Snorbul screams as he falls out of the sky, having teleported above the giant, and comes down splitting it in half with his ax

Hurt and exhausted, the group takes gathers to discuss if they should push deeper into the swamp.

Snorbul flies straight up to get a good look at the dark stain on the horizon

The City of the Dead is visible as a dark shadow against the horizon, the massive walls and structures can barely be seen through the haze and all about the great wall, legions can be seen moving

A great storm of wild magic can be seen churning over the city and Snorbul swears he can see a barrier, like a massive dome of energies encasing the city.

The Demiplane?

As he peers closer still, he senses many hundreds of Glyphs of warnding (confirmed by Feanon)

He returns to the group and tells them what he has seen.

The group has a plan to leave Alaskar and to return home and fighting this vanguard only solidifies that plan.

The group turns South West, away from Sharzad and heading toward the location of the Machina Factory and Temple of Fawden.

They stop by the shipwreck and manage to pull a small amount of treasure from the wreckage.

Tark tries to fish something from the swamp, but only catches a skeletal arm.

The oppressive heat and humidity of the swamp becomes unbearable and Feanon decides to change the scenery.

Using a Mirage Arcane, the Wizard changes the landscape for a mile around, making it a perfect replica of his Tower back home.

The group is astounded

They try to rest but quickly find that although the scenery has changed, the bugs remain.

Feanon then takes the next hour to memorize his Magnificent Mansion spell for some proper shelter

As he is doing this, Tark, Buumi, JmJm and Snorbul explore a little bit and come across a terrible scene a few islands away.

There were survivors of the shipwreck, but they did not get very far.

Maybe 20 people had come to this island with some of their crates intact.

They had been set upon by massive reptillian beasts

Gargantuan crocodiles, some twenty feet, some getting up to forty are tearing into the caravan “survivors”

Tark spots a young woman, still alive and rushes in, throwing knives into the eyes of the biggest croc, who goes wild and starts to fight the other crocodiles nearby (not understanding where the attack came from)

The group rushes in, grabbing four people still alive

Tark puts one badly mauled man out of his misery

They retreat to a safe distance and Buumi goes about healing the worst of their wounds.

Concerningly though, all of those crocodiles were riddled with corruption and some of the bites look infected…

They fall back to the rest of the group and find that Feanon has created his Magnificent Mansion within the Arcane Mirage of his tower.

The shipwreck survivors are awed and mutter about “demigods” and “empyreans”

The group sequesters the survivors in their own quarters in case their infection causes them to become dangerous

The group then settles into their quarters for the evening, taking a much needed rest.


The next morning, the regular routine is interrupted by a scream from JmJm’s quarters

It appears that while rescuing the civilians, he has become infected by Zalaam’s Corruption.  He is blind! And Feverish with hallucinations of his (disappointed) father!

Buumi rushes to his friends side and cleanses the corruption, with some difficulty.

JmJm embraces him as the panic subsides and then the morning routine continues.

The healers visit the Civilians and find that many of them are badly corrupted, feverish with boils, cataracts and lesions

It's only four people and the group uses their holy magics to cleanse them of the disease and Doc casts Regeneration on two of them, promising to get the other two the next day.

With the civilians saved, the group sends them to Jareem in the Golden Tower.

Tark chats with the Ruby Dragon and lets him know to take care of the civilians

He also asks if Jareem is in Dragon form and wearing the Turban.

He is.

The mansion spell ends and the group finds themselves in the Mirage Arcane of Feanon’s tower

Before leaving the area, Feanon goes to the top of his tower, to where his Teleportation ring would be and looks out across the expanse of the swamp.




The stain on the horizon rumbles with purple lightning and all of a sudden, Feanon finds his vision transported, rushing across the leagues to the city of the dead, through its crumbling streets, and up the onyx sides of a vast pyramid. 

Atop it a swirling vortex of energies lights the sky.  Hordes of undead shamble through the decayed streets and darker things glide through the stormy clouds. 

The energies atop the Pyramid twist and look like a great eye. 

Vecna sees Feanon. 

In his mind the Wizard hears Zalaam, Vecna, saying that Feanon should join him.  The wizard turns away, breaking the vision, and descends his tower.

The group turns to the Southwest and they begin their long and arduous trek across the fetid expanse of Thueba Swamp.

The hours drag by and the humidity hangs thick about the place

Bugs bite and fly around the groups eyes and mouths and they do all they can to fly or ride above the swamp

The trek is exhausting 

As the group gets to a particularly island filled section, they group up for a bite to eat and drink

As they do, they are attacked in an ambush

Small, pale figures rise from the vegetation, mud and descend from trees throwing blighted spears and shooting dark arrows.

The Halflings of Alaskar are attacking!
