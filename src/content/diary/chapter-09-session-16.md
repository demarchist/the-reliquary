The group takes a rest and has Cirrus begin to scout the next section of the caverns.

Summoning his familia as a small bat, Cirrus sends the creature down the tunnels.

Seeing through its eyes, he notes that there are many nesting Cockatrice and they take note of the fluttering bat.

He makes it into the massive cavern chamber they saw before, with the Fire Beetles and notes that the melee there has escalated.

A monstrous Fire-beetle, the size of an elephant can be seen spouting jets of flame across the attacking Cockatrice, burning many away and letting the smaller beetles surge forwards to consume the crackling corpses.

The bat takes a moment to hide among the shadows, losing the interest of the Cockatrice.

The bat then heads south, to investigate the grand edifice that makes up the southern end of the cavern.

The bat approaches a large mansion, carved into the rock with a waterfall spilling from the front and two sweep staircases reaching from the cavern floor, to the second level of the building.

Petrified drow can be seen standing guard.

The bat flutters into the structure and Cirrus’ report comes out a bit more stressed.

He describes dozens of petrified Drow, standing in ranks, filling the great hall of the place.

At the far end, up on a raised section of floor and with two staircases leading up, is a throne.

Standing near the throne, Cirrus spots the Medusa; the Drow Priestess, whose hair writhes, made of living snakes.

Red lightning flickers around her in an aura; The Bane has found a new host.

At her side is a massive Basilisk, covered in spider carapace armor that appears to be nesting atop two stonelike eggs.

Nearby, a treasure trove of jewels, gold and chests can be seen, as well as an extravagant wardrobe of gowns and dresses.

Cirrus hears the woman rambling and repeats the words to Patches, who translates.

They hear that the Drow Priestess is mad, rambling that her graduation nears and that she must look her finest.


Cirrus breaks the connection and the group goes over their options.

Tark is a surprising font of information as Gaddock had once fought a Medusa, defeating it with a mirror to turn its own gaze upon itself.

There is some confusion over the comments, as Cirrus DID note mirrors in Medusa’s den, the vain priestess clearly fawning over herself when he was watching.

The group decides that assaulting the Medusa directly is a foolhardy proposition, especially with evidence of the Bane still existing.

The group returns to the city to un-petrify Trisk and the unknown Svirfneblin girl.

As the group returns to the main settlement, Tark stops, smelling sulfur.

He points it out and between he and Patches, manage to narrow down the smell.

They find an almost imperceptible line of ooze, smelling distinctly of Sulfur that trails into the settlement proper, the line going under the door.

Without any argument, they decide to cut the ooze-line, the thing releasing a hiss of acrid smoke as Feanon blasts it with a powerful Firebolt.

Like an elastic line being cut, the thing retreats to the north and the group re-enters blingdenstone proper.

As they re-enter the settlement to head to Gurnik, the group notes that there is a bit of commotion, and after some asking, they find out that someone exploded into corrosive Jelly.  When pressed, it was one of the strangely acting Deep Gnomes.

The group realizes that the strangely acting Svirfneblin are most likely being replaced by shapeshifting oozes and they intend warn Chief Diggermattock.

As Cirrus and Gurnik do their thing, Gundren and Patches head to the Craftsmen hall to retrieve the Chardalyn spell gems they commissioned.

When they arrive, they find a great many of the Svirfneblin craftsmen crowding the Gemcutters.

Approaching, Patches and Gundren find the leader of the Deep Gnomes looking over the Spell Gems.

The Gems though, are contained in Resonant Bells, an ingenious design by one of the Svirfneblin Gemcutters when he noted that the Chardalyn, when cracked, will release its spell and then reform over time.

They collect the Resonant Bells and Chief Diggermattock announces that he is very interested in a potential trade deal for more Chardalyn.

The group warns Diggermattock of the potential Ooze incursion and he says he will begin working on a solution.

Back at the shrine, Cirrus finishes Restoring Trisk and begins the ceremony for the girl.

Trisk reports his story; Taking a resurrection stone (expensive Diamond) to diffuse the Medusa’s glare (which did not work), as he was battling her minions, this unknown Deep Gnome came to his aid (gesturing to the petrified girl).

Trisk also tells the group that the Ghost of the Burrow Warden has been training his friends and him.

After the girl is revived, the group discovers her to be a were-rat, hailing from the warren to the Northwest.  She assisted Trisk because she could not just watch him die.

Cirrus relates that he has two very nice Wererats at home and offers the girl and her kin a place to live.  

She crinkles her nose at the offer, rejecting it outright and stating that Blingdenstone is their home.

Though treated with some coldness and some stern stares, none of the Svirfneblin attack the wererat, but the disdain is obvious.

The girl quickly takes her leave when no one moves to hinder her.

Trisk rushes on after the girl and Gurnik talks to the group.

The Wererats are enigmatic, not attacking or causing outright issues, but not helping the settlement either and keeping to themselves.

There have been a few clashes, but seem to be mostly misunderstandings rather than outright hostile actions.

The general sentiment seems to be that the Wererats are a disease to be cured, but not a pressing one.


The changes the conversation to The Stone Priestess and how to deal with her.

They report to Gurnik what they have found and they come up with a plan.

They will have Earth Elementals Earth Glide the group to the rear of the Medusa’s lair.

There, a small cavern will be excavated and glamoured by a Hallucinatory terrain to look like Arach Tinilith, the grand academy of Lolth.

The group will then draw the Stone Priestess from her forces, making her think she is relieving her graduation and then “deal” with her alone.

Patches reminds everyone that the priestess is hers to deal with ultimately; a commandment from Elistraee.

This irks Tark and as he concentrates, analyzing his friend, he realizes that she is under a divine compulsion to do this.

When pressed, Patches reveals that she is terrified of death, as it would deliver her apostate soul directly to Lolth for eternal torture.

She hopes that by serving the Moonlight Dancer, she will save herself and her son from the eternal damnation her people endure in The Abyss…
