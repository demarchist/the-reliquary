The group immediately moves to cross the Chionthar River and move on the Efreeti this very night.

Several of the group move across the river quickly using magic, but Cirrus attempts to swim after altering his form.  It takes him an hour and exhausts the lanky Warlock.

Meanwhile, the others have begun scouting the area on the other side of the river.

Patches and Gundren both spot the injured Efreeti Raider become visible and land in the nearby Village.

The town is clearly occupied by the Amnian Army but they do not assist the injured Efreeti, indeed they act as if the group’s slaying of the Efreeti raiders is not their business.

Liking the sound of that, Gundren returns to the group at the river bank to inform them they should bypass the town.

Patches stays in the town a little longer, intent on finding out a bit more.

Disguised as an old lady, she spots a shrine to Orcus in the center of the town, built around the gallows and a number of bodies hanging there.

Strangely, all sides seem to avoid that site - she spots no one attending that grisly location.

Moving up the spire of Chaunteau, goddess of The Harvest and Fertility, she spots the larger temple farther inland, atop a nearby hill.

The large spire there is easily visible, with great fires burning amongst the grounds.

Patches returns to the group after watching the Efreeti flee through the air, toward the temple of Chaunteau in the distance.

The group circumvents the town and heads up the hill toward the temple.

There, they scout it from the air and quickly determine that it is too dangerous of a force to simply attack.

With a small wall, but easily defended choke points, the Temple spire sits at the center of an encampment of at least fifty human tribesmen, each circle of tents gathered around a blazing bonfire of living elemental fire.

The once beautiful gardens of Chaunteau have been burned to ash here and there are many cages with prisoners.

The temple Spire in the center has several large openings and they see the Efreeti commander come out from within to address his troops.

The group decides to send in Tark and Patches through a tunnel dug by Snorbul.

Under the main walls and in a deserted part of the burned garden, Patches and Tark easily move into the temple Spire.

Inside they see four Efreeti laughing at their injured companion and handing him healing potions.

They berate the survivor of the raid as they begin to leisurely prepare for battle against the group, gathering weapons, drinking, reveling etc.

Patches finds the alcove used by the Commanding Efreeti as his main chamber/treasure room and pushes past a burning illusion to get inside.

In the treasure room she finds many valuables and pockets a good amount.

She comes across a prisoner in a cage there though and recognizes the woman.

Ezmerelda D’Avenir of Barovia

Turns out Ez had decided to become a mercenary after parting ways with the group and there was good money along the frontlines of the war

She was arrogant from her victories with the group and got in too deep with the Efreeti.

Her band was taken as slaves through the planar gate to the City of Brass in the Plane of Fire.

Patches frees the woman and takes her out of there in her bag of holding.

Before leaving though, Patches finds a hidden, trapped alcove and grabs at it.

Diving out of the burning trap, Patches clutches the Efreeti Chain armor, even as the hot metal scalds her hands.

She stuffs it into her bag and hides herself just as the Efreeti rush into the room to investigate the trap.

Seeing the legendary armor stolen, the Efreeti all summon fire elementals and begin to search the area.

Search as they might though, they do not find Patches.

The Efreeti think they have missed the flight of the Thief and begin to spread out from the Spire - the leader goes to the Planar Gate and calls forth a young Red Dragon enslaved to its will.

The Dragon begins sniffing around for a scent as the whole camp comes on alert - the Chief of the Efreeti - **Shal Bartok, **is Irate.

Patches makes a break for it, rushing back to the tunnel just as the Dragon gets her scent.

She throws a Deck of Illusions card of a Kobold and the Dragon dives on it.

She flees down the tunnel with the group, to the awaiting Teleportation circle and they flee the Heartlands, returning to the Barony.

Patches lets Ezmerelda out of the bag and the group catches their breath, discussing what just happened back there.

Buumi is uneasy having left so many prisoners to be enslaved and Ezmerelda agrees, they head off to discuss what they can do about it.

Gundren dons a badge of nondetection and then takes his prized armor to his workshop to have it fitted.

Patches speaks with Veygar about the upcoming job.

Snorbul researches Dragons. Thinking about that enslaved Red Dragon back with the Efreeti.

Everyone else retires for the night, exhausted and unsure what the outcome of the war down in Scornubel will be…
