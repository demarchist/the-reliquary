The group stared down the long corridors of the mausoleum and came to a sensible conclusion: clearing a veritable army of undead from beneath the city was beyond their current abilities and beyond the scope of their contract. Fëanon grabbed a zombie arm as proof of the infestation, and the group headed back to the surface to deliver the news.

On the way, a runner arrived breathless with a sealed message for Patches from Lady Faye. The group decided it was past time they met Patches' mysterious benefactor. They sent the messenger off with the zombie arm and instructions to deliver it to the Flaming Fist mercenary company, then headed for the Garden District.

## Lady Faye

There they met Zhink, an eccentric Moon Elf warrior and another of Lady Faye's champions. Buumi attempted to intimidate him with a strong handshake and got soundly bested. Zhink confirmed that Patches was indeed one of Lady Faye's champions — a revelation that astounded the group. Several bets got paid off over the fact that Patches had actually been telling the truth. Zhink was offended by their surprise.

After introductions, Zhink took his leave and Lord Hufflebram — a rotund nobleman — waddled out with Lady Faye. Tark, who had just downed an entire carafe of whiskey, struggled not to throw up on the lord's shoes. Buumi tried unsuccessfully to woo Lady Faye.

Lady Faye offered the group a task: infiltrate Lord Fendrel's vault as a test of his new security system — with the lord's permission, more or less. The group readily accepted and discovered they would be attending a masquerade party.

## Preparations

The group visited the tailor they had saved from the Brotherhood that morning. Upset that they had found him but knowing he owed a debt, the tailor created a magnificent outfit for Tark. They then bought masks for the masquerade — Tark an owl, Buumi a wolf, and Fëanon a mind flayer.

After reviewing the infiltration plan with Patches, the group arrived at Lord Fendrel's manor intending to enter through the servants' entrance as performers assisting JmJm. Upon arriving, however, they decided that two actual nobles and a high elf wizard shouldn't have to sneak in through the back. A strange harlequin approached — Patches in disguise as a normal elf, which thoroughly flustered the group. They browbeat the front entrance guards into submission with writs of nobility and walked in.

## The Masquerade

Inside, a grand ball was in full swing. Buumi boldly approached the guards at the restricted area and asked if they could pass through. They could not. The group shrugged and decided to enjoy the party while they figured out a way past.

The first game was a wooing competition for the attention of a noble lady. The group made appropriate fools of themselves — Buumi lifted a table, Tark danced atop it, then Fëanon cast grease and everything came crashing down. Fëanon walked away with the winning token: an amethyst shaped like a heart.

Passing through the ballroom, Buumi overheard a lordling serenading several ladies with claims of having vanquished many undead. Buumi called him out. Fisticuffs ensued. The lordling dropped in a single hit. Buumi moved on without comment.

The unicorn horn snatching contest featured a tiny horse with a horn strapped to its head. Tark leaped into the ring and, after a few frantic seconds, snatched the pearl horn and emerged victorious.

The final contest was a firebending competition. Tark spoke to his Ring of Fire Elemental Control and performed a beautiful kata that summoned a fire elemental in the shape of a flowing dragon. The crowd was mesmerized. He won the final token, and the group traded all three for a Ring of Mind Shielding — which Fëanon put on and discovered contained a trapped soul.

## Past the Guards

Armed with gossip overheard during the party — a lord complaining about a door guard named Dorian accidentally letting his horse get stolen — the group talked the restricted area guards into leaving their posts temporarily. One needed to be bribed with Buumi's flask. The group slipped through into the restricted wing, one step closer to their goal.
