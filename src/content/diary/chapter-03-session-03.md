The group stares down the long corridors of the mausoleum, thinking about what to do next.  After some consideration, they decide that clearing a veritable army from beneath the city is not only beyond their current abilities, but beyond the purview of their instructions.  Fey anon grabs a zombie arm from one of the recent undead as proof that the catacombs are infested, for the Mercenary company.  As the group heads back into the city proper to deliver the news of undead infestation, a runner comes up to the group out of breath, carrying a sealed message for Patches from Lady Faye.  Deciding that the group simply had to meet Patches mysterious benefactor, the group heads off to the Garden district, giving the messenger the zombie arm and instructions to take it to the Flaming Fist Mercenary company to prove the undead threat.

Some time later, the group finds themselves in the Garden district and meet up with an eccentric moon elf warrior; Zhink.  Buumi attempts to intimidate Zhink with a strong hand shake, but ends up getting bested. Zhink, a champion of lady Faye tells the group of the Lady and that Patches is indeed another of her champions.  The group is astounded at this, and a few bets get paid off over the fact Patches was actually telling the truth.  Zhink is offended at this. Zhink  takes his leave after introducing the group to Lord Hufflebram and Lady Faye.  Tark, who had just drank an entire carafe of whiskey, has a hard time not throwing up on the fat lords shoes.  Buumi tries unsuccessfully to woo Lady Faye.

After pleasantries, Lord Hufflebram waddles off to his study, leaving Lady Faye with the group.  She offers the group a task - to infiltrate Lord Fendrel's Vault (by his own permission...maybe?) as a test of his new security system.  The group readily accepts and discovers that they will be heading to a party!

Getting ready, the group heads to the tailor's shop whom they saved earlier that day.  Upset that they managed to find him, but knowing he had a debt, the tailor creates a magnificent outfit for Tark.  The group then heads to a masquerade store to buy masks for the upcoming party.  Tark purchases and Owl mask, Buumi a Wolf mask and Fey a Mind flayer mask. Patches at this time, is off performing a task for Lady Faye.

After making sure they look fabulous, and going over the plan of infiltration with Patches, the group heads to the manor - intending to go in through the servants entrance as performers assiting JmJm.  Upon arriving at the manor, the group decides that they really don't want to do that, seeing as two of the three of them are actual nobles, and Patches is nowhere to be found.  Approaching the main entrance, a strange harlequin approaches, turning out to be Patches in disguise as a normal elf (the same but white…).  Thoroughly flustered by her disguise, the group heads in through the main entrance after brow-beating the guards into submission with writs of nobility.

 Heading into the party proper, they are greeted by a grand ball, complete with entertaining games .  The group scouts the floor, Buumi even being so bold as to just approach the guards to the restricted area, asking if they can go through, they cannot…

Turning back, the group shrugs and decides to participate in the party and figure out a way past the guards.

The first game they play, is a wooing competition for the attention of a noble lady.  The group makes appropriate fools of themselves, Buumi lifting a table, Tark dancing atop, before being greased by Fey and everything coming crashing down.  Fey'Anon walked away from the game with the winning token - an amethyst shaped like a heart.

Heading to the next event, Buumi walks past a bard serenading several ladies claiming he vanquished many undead.  Looking the lordling over, Buumi calls him out and fisticuffs ensue - with Buumi knocking him out in a single hit and then moving on with the group to the Unicorn horn snatching contest.

The group finds the unicorn to be a tiny horse with a horn strapped to it's head.  Tark immediately leaps into the ring, and after a few frantic seconds, manages to snatch the pearl horn and leave the arena.

While heading to the final challenge, the group overhears a lord complaining about one of the door guards, Dorian, being a fool and accidentally letting his horse get stolen.

The final contest is a firebending competition.  Speaking to his ring and calling upon the flames, Tark manages a beautiful Kata that summons a fire elemental in the shape of a flowing dragon.  The crowd is appropriately mesmerized and he wins the final token - which the group trades in along with the others for a Ring of Mind Shielding, which Fey promptly puts on his finger. And discovers it has a soul inside.

The group then heads straight to the door guards and with the information they overheard, convince the guards they are needed elsewhere temporarily.  The guards leave (one needing to be bribed with Buumi's flask) and the small group slips through, into the restricted area, and one step closer to their goal.
