The group begins their trek across the city, as they go though they begin to question their destination.

Eventually, they stop by the Westrift to discuss whether they should maybe just leave the city.

As they are talking, Nose, the Drow agent escorting them, appears to question why the group has stopped.

The group mentions that they are considering just leaving.

Patches states she would like to stay to see how things progress, in case things go badly.

The group agrees and the decision is solidified when Nose mentions that Jarlaxle still would want a distraction and he would owe them a favor.

The group decides to stay and begin their dangerous trek throug the Drow Districs, taking a northerly route through the city.

Avoiding Drow Patrols, Priestesses and gangs of displaced hooligans, the group makes good time and manage to traverse a good part of the city without incident.

They get to the edge of Tier Breche and see the large parade grounds being patrolled.

Feanon looks up to the great tower of Sorcere, rising above the plateau housing the other Acadamy buildings.

He can feel the magic emenations and the power of the wards.

He reluctantly turns away and the group skirts the Acadamy, heading south.

The neighborhood gets a bit rougher as they grow close to the Clawrift and the devastation wrought by Demogorgon.

Patches notices they are being followed and when she checks, she sees **Grein, Vizeron’s **apprentice following them.

Patches alerts the group and Tark goes invisible, stalks the wizard and then stuns him.

Tying the wizard up, they begin the last leg of the trek back to the Inn with the wizard seemingly drunk and unconscious in Buumi’s arms.

The group moves past the Fighting pits of the Duthcloim and Cirrus feels a tug on his soul, he can feel Marilith there.

Patches mentions she may want to check out the pits but the group is split, especially when Cirrus recounts his evil background with the Demon.

The group decides to honor Cirrus’ wishes and they do not stop.

Just as they near Narbondellyn’s Shadow, they run afoul of a Priestess, but due to proper deference and grovelling, she overlooks the slight and continues on.


Back in the Inn, the group finds the other guests have left and they take the unconscious Grein into their rooms to interrogate him.

Mr. Pickles is on lookout.

They wake Grein and intimidate the man into silence.

They decide that they cant kill him as it would instantly tip off Vizeron.

They decide to place a Geas on the man so he cannot speak of anything involving the group.

As they are doing this, Mr Pickles reports that Vizeron’s Death Slaad is downstairs looking for Grein.

They release the wizard who rushes away.

The group is sure they will have to deal with Vizeron, but hopefully they can throw him off a little while longer.

The group heads to the Common room to eat and rest.

Cirrus heads out while the others are resting, heading to the fighting pit. 

Wrestling with his conscience he finally gives in and heads inside.

He looks into the fighting pits, but sees nothing but *her*

He sees Marilith on a stage, looking over the dirt of the arena floor, her serpentine body lounging on a hundred severed heads.

She scans the crowd with an amused smirk, fangs and tusks protruding from a far too pretty human face.

The scales of her snake body are slick with blood and covered in golden jewelry.

She scans the audience and Cirrus ducks into cover, his heart pounding as he rushes from the Arena.

Patches, Tark and Buumi decide to go and check out the Brotherl supposedly taken over by Grazz’t, demon lord of pleasures.

They head through the city, now well practiced and make it to the Pleasure houses without issue.

The largest one there appears to have a perimeter of sorts, stopping anyone going in, but only it seems to issue a warning.

They see three drow stumble out of the pleasure house and approach them, but find them in a daze, and injured in bizarre ways.

Tark decides to scale the structure to investigate.

Tark easily scales the building and manages to peek over the top.

On the pinnacle of the building, Tark finds an orgy of excess (which also includes a regular orgy)

He sees people gorging themselves on food, drowning themselves on drink, engaging in dance and sex until they collapse of exhaustion.  Tark sees several bodies, all clearly killed due to the vices present.

As Tark looks past, he sees the writhing victims of Graz’zt, being tortured by his demons and partaking in all the excess with abandon.

Sitting at the center, on a bizarre throne of sculpted muscle and flesh, sits a beautiful and terrible figure.

Graz’zt.

Tark finds himself being pulled in and his mind twists under the demonic assault of witnessing this spectacle.

He closes his eyes, centers himself and then leaps away, returning to his friends.

He meets up with them in the alley where they wait.

They ask him what he saw, but Tark wont answer.

Feeling bad, Patches Buumi and Tark all return to Narbondellyn’s shadow.

There, they meet with everyone else for a meal in then common room.

While there, a Drow enters the establishment and approaches them.

He is the same Drow they saw with Jarlaxle, the incredibly bland looking fellow.

Patches asks his name, he says Kimmuriel.

This jogs Feanon’s memory and he remembers Lo’Dan calling out to this Kimmuriel during the battle with Kangaxx.

This is the one that teleported them to the middle of the ocean in pursuit.

Feanon inquires about his power and discovers that this Drow is a Psionicist and clearly a very powerful one to be teleporting groups of people.

He has come with a purpose though and informs the group that the plan they put forward to House Baenre has been leapt upon.

Indeed, Archmage Gromph has returned to the city and has the spell in hand as they speak, the prisoner exchange will happen within 24 hours and the armies are already being mustered.

It appears that the Drow want the Demon Lords resolved as soon as possible.

As such, House Baenre eagerly await the delivery of the Spell Components needed.

The group lets Kimmuriel know that they need a Purple Worm Egg and he sets Nose to retrieve one from the Bazaar, no matter the cost.

As soon as Finn is back in the Barony, the group will hand Kimmuriel the rest of the spell components.

The idea of a distraction for Jarlaxle comes up again.

With the Demon Lord issue being taken care of, Jarlaxle needs a distraction to extract his own VIP from the Do’Urden Compound.  To do this, he needs a valid excuse to send his soldiers out into the city and give himself an opening.

The group asks how much Bregan D’Aerthe is willing to pay and Kimmuriel smiles, saying the target itself should provide ample incentive.

He suggests the West-Wall Slave Market.  

Close enough to Do’Urden for Jarlaxle to send troops, far enough away from the noble houses to be vulnerable and filled with slaves to be freed…

The group is intrigued, liking the idea of freeing prisoners of the evil Drow and begin to look over the map

They begin to plan an assault on the small temple at the Slave Plaza and how best to free as many of the prisoners as possible.

The Slave Market itself is a circular open plaza with a temple in the center.  

The Temple is a shrine to Lolth and is where the slave Market is run from.  

It has a compliment of four Priestesses and 22 soldiers, though at any given time at least half are patrolling the slave pens.

The Priestesses are being supported by packs of lesser demons.

The Slave pens themselves exist below the plaza, in pie-shaped wedges creating a radial prison with the only way in being through the central Temple.

Underground, a solid wall of stone 15ft thick acts as barrier between the slave pens and the stench-streets.

Kimmuriel does not have exact numbers, but he estimates at least 600 slaves are currently being held.

When asked how they are expected to get out with the slaves, Kimmuriel shrugs, saying its not his problem - he suggests arming the Goblin and Orc slaves and having them Riot out into the nearby city.
