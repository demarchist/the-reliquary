The group plans their assault on the Slave Pens.

Over the next several hours, while waiting to hear from Kimmuriel about the Prisoner Transfer for Finn, the group decides on a plan.

They will hire Bregan D’Aerthe scouts, 35 of them for 5,000gp to help.

The scouts will lead the freed slaves, in groups of 30 out of the city through the Clawrift using the Under-streets of the Stenchstreets to do so while the city is distracted by the Demon Lords above.

The group will move in, using Passwall spells to break into the Prison itself and then go from room to room freeing and ferrying Prisoners out the hole as stealthily as possible.

They purchase Weapons from a Bregan D’Aerthe contact for the slaves.

The group mentions Vizeron to the Drow and he is surprised, knowing the wily old wizard.

The group mentions that he was trying to cast a death ritual with the original summoning - he will try something, though the group does not know what.

The Drow Psionicist says he will look into it and takes his leave, saying he will return later.

A Duergar weapons merchant shows up during the day and the group negotiate with him, paying for several hundred weapons which the Duergar happily supplies.

Kimmuriel returns one last time before the scheduled Slave Heist and Demon Lord Battle to talk with the group.

He brings with him a single daffodil for Patches who takes it, confused.

Until she realizes it means that Finn is in the Barony and Kimmuriel acknowledges.

The group hands the Drow Psionicist the rest of the spell ingredients for Archmage Gromph to summon the Demon Lords.

Kimmuriel mentons that they know Vizeron’s Apprentice, Grein and spotted him in the city today, giving contacts small clay urns.

Kimmuriel agrees that Vizeron is up to something.

He then leaves to give the Drow Armies the means to cleanse the Underdark of the Demon Lord menace.

The group heads out as well, preparing for battle and taking to the Stenchstreets beneath the main city, keeping out of sight.

Before heading below though, they noten a general flow of citizenry away from Tiere Breche, the plateau housing the Parade Grounds and Acadamies of the city.

Looking up at the platear, the group can see the amassed armies of the Drow.

A single figure hovers in the air, lit by swirling magics.  Gromph Baenre.

The group heads below and meet up with their Bregan D’Aerthe Mercenaries.

Moving into position at the West-wall Slave Market, they find the subterranean outer wall of the holding cells.

The first casting of Passwall and the shredding of the Lead Farraday cage gets the group within 10ft of the slave pens.

Patches quaffs the potion of earthglide the group traded for and she sinks into the stone, poking only her eyes out into the room ahead.

Goblins.

Patches quickly identifies the leader and swims through the wall to him, putting her blades to her throat and cowing the creature and thus, the tribe.

They dissolve the last ten feet of stone, creating an exit from the Slave Prison.

The group moves in and secures the exit, Patches and Gundren begin to move into the Prison itself.

They liberate Dwarves, Goblins, Humans, elves, gnomes and Orcs.

The group arming each group and moving them toward the exit.

There are several close calls with the guards, resulting in one blindingly fast skirmish that left two Drow Guards dead and a number of Demons destroyed.

The ground begins to shake and Feanon can feel that the ritual to summon the demons has begun.

Patches gets near the stairs up to the Temple of Lolth and hears the Drow above in the middle of their own religious ritual.  She knows they have time.

Patches and Gundren manage to bluff past another guard and slip past a caged Troll (not freeing THAT).

They get to one of the last wings of the Prison and find all the slaves here dead, covered in black veins but otherwise unharmed.

Something is wrong.

Back at the exit from the Prison, Slaves leaving in droves and being led away by the mercenaries toward the Clawrift, Tark smells something.

Beyond the stench of the Understreets, Tark notes a familiar and disgusting smell though he cannot quite place it.

He calls a warning, recognizing it as magic, but not which spell.

A few moments later, a wall of noxious looking fog rolls toward them, filling the Stenchstreets alleyways.

Feanon calls out, telling the group to fall back, recognizing the *Stinking Cloud*

Patches and Gundren go about releasing the last of the slaves, noting many here dead by the same black veins.

Here they release a group of Goblins, arming them.

The goblins dont want to flee and surprisingly head to the stairs up to the Drow Temple, intent on attacking.

Patches and Gundren check the last of the Slave pens noting another Stinking Cloud

coming down the steps from above and a commotion breaking up the Drow Ritual.

A figure comes rushing down the steps, leaping in great bounds, Faeriefire light sconces reflecting off it’s red toadlike skin.

The Slaad sees Patches and Gundren and rushes toward them.

It hits the Goblin slave shield first, tearing into them and giving Patches and Gundren time to flee, back to the group.

Slaad are in pursuit.

Back by the exit, Feanon drops the passwall, blocking the approaching Stinking Cloud.

Patches and Gundren rush back to the group, seeing all the Slaves had managed to flee, they report that there are none others (the rest are dead).

As they approach, a blast of Necromantic energies detonates nearby, catching Feanon, Cirrus, Tark and Buumi.

Feanon shouts, recognizing the spell as Circle of Death.

The group gathers, not wanting to wait around to find out what’s happening.

Feanon teleports the group.

And is counterspelled.

Twenty feet from the group a figure appears from invisibility as it shatters the Dweomer from Feanon.

Grein Osstyl, Vizeron’s apprentice cackles.

Wielding a strange twisting staff, covered in numerous nodules and wearing a metal harness of sorts on his chest, the Wizard looks far more dangerous than the unassuming Drow they had met before.

His stylish, serpent embroidered robes billow as the Stinking cloud rolls forward, beginning to flow over Grein with seemingly no effect.

He calls out, saying that he will now avenge himself on the group for their insults and that their souls will feed the master.

Not wanting to tangle, Cirrus erects a Wall of Force before Grein and the group falls back inside the nearest slave pen, blocking line of sight from the Wizard.

As they do, they see numerous Red Slaad rushing in to support Grein and the Drow Wizard, smiling confidently.

Across the city, Gromph, Archmage of Menzoberranzan, finishes the ritual spell to summon the Demon Lords…
