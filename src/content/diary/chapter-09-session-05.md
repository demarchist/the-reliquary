The group quickly strips the Duergar of important items; weapons, a letter, armor, keys and a jar of Keoghtom’s Ointment.

Patches turns to the Chardalyn itself and begins to examine where best to mine a small portion.

She hones in on a section and chips away with Gundren’s help, managing to extract a 5lb chunk of unoxidized material.

These deposits are almost completely spent, having been exposed to the air for millenia.

Thorna chucks her hammer at a section, smashing an oxidized layer off of the top as lightning is absorbed into the large deposit.  It’s quite pretty.

Cirrus heads back to the Entrance to rest, healing the worst injured as he goes.

As Snorbul joins the group, he notes that the entire cavern collapsed onto a chamber beneath long, long ago. 

The unusual stair-stepping was caused by the collapse and the mine was made much later.

The group looks around seeing a small camp just to the west and another deposit of Chardalyn, they head there before going deeper into the mine.

As they approach, they can see the pulverized Goblin bodies scattered around the campsite.

Gundren is the first to hear the whimpering in the tent and he points it out to Thorna, who chucks her hammer through it.

The tent collapses on a terrified Goblin.

The group surrounds the creature and quickly terrify the thing into spilling its guts.

It was dropped off by the Duergar, with its kin to mine this deposit.

He went to poop, as he was away from the camp, he was attacked by the Roper but got away (his friend did not) and when he got back to camp, everyone here had been pulverized.

The group looks at the Chardalyn and discover a powerful Earth Elemental living within the crystal.

They let the Goblin go and he rushes off deeper into the Underdark.

Fey feels a malicious hunger from the elemtnal and warns the group.

Thorns chucks her hammer at it.

The elemental surges forth, a strange ball of stony limbs.

It smashes into Thorna, Fey and Gundren.

Patches rushes in and between the group, the powerful elemental is quickly dismantled.

The elemental gets in many good strikes itself though before it dies.

The group is being whittled down.

The group collects a number of Elemental Motes of Earth (Crafting and 1-use Grease spell if thrown) from the creature and a vial of Earth Elemental Essence in a small vial (Conjure Elemental: Earth elemental as an action).

Patches takes another crack at the Chardalyn and manages to extract another 5lb chunk with help from the group.

Fey feels that the Chardalyn has absorbed an energy, a hunger that permeates the cavern, distinct from the corruption of the Abyss.  This power is far older than the current issues the Underdark faces.

The heavy noise begins to lessen in the cavern and the Duergar mining tapers off in the background.

Patches sneaks on ahead while the group catches their breath, deciding that its time to get eyes on the Duergar.

As she approaches the southern spur of rock that separates the massive cavern, a Duergar rushes across her path and into a small tunnel entrance.

Patches follows and quickly realizes that this is a messenger runner.

She tries to paralyze him but cannot find a seam in his armor.

The Duergar spins on her but in a deft move, Patches stays out of his line of sight.

Knowing he’s not alone, the Duergar turns invisible and begins to sprint deeper into the tunnels, leaving the area.

Patches does not pursue, but she does set up a series of traps in the tunnel entrance.

She returns to the main chamber and gets closer to the main group of Duergar.

Meanwhile, Snorbul has wandered off into the Duergar barracks.

He opens the front door, gets shot in the face by a series of rigged crossbow bolts and continues inside.

Inside the Barracks, he sees a massive Iron-bound chest and approaches it, realizing that he has the key (taken from the shapeshifting Duergar).

He gives it a once over and figures that it’s probably trapped.

He decides to try and drag it out of the room instead of opening it...which triggers the trap.

A stone cutout drops from the ceiling, carved to contain the box and crush anyone trying to open the chest.

It clips Snorbul as he dives backwards, bruising him horribly and landing with a resounding crash that shakes the cavern.

Everyone hears the crash and the Duergar turn, looking in the groups direction.

The leader can be seen pacing back and forth at the lip of a massive hole, dug directly down, a small bridge spans it and a crane is secured at its center.

They are raising something up from below.

A half dozen Duergar and four Goblins guard the area and sound can be heard from within the hole.

The impatient leader yells up into the cavern and the group spots movement from farther up.

A massive spider with a Duergar astride it walks into view.

They hitch the spider up to the crane and it begins to pull.

The Duergar take defensive formations.

Patches returns to the group and relays what she saw.

Thinking that there’s most certainly more spider cavalry, everyone watches intently.

Patches hears whispering from above and throws out a Faerie fire, catching one of the two mounted Duergar.

The group below repositions to fire on the Cavalry.

Patches Tar bombs them to the ceiling and then rushes up the wall to attack them.

Meanwhile, Snorbul and Thorna are attacked by a flanking pair of Duergar seeking to pincer with the Kavalrachni.

The battle is fierce and quickly turns on the Duergar and the lone surviving warrior flees back to the main force.

The item from below has been raised - it is a Sarcophagus of Chardalyn.

Fey can feel a presence from within.

The Duergar nearby the Sarcophagus sway and stagger and the leader stumbles forwards and heaves at the cover-stone.

Thorna and Fey rush forwards and both cast an Ice-storm down on the Duergar.

The Goblins are killed instantly and the Duergar are forced to huddle together under their shields for protection.

The Leader stands there, uncaring and heaves again and moves the lid.

A flash of green light and the leader is petrified in place, but is quickly shattered by the ice-storm raging around him.

Another nearby Duergar staggers toward the sarcophagus.

Those nearby realize something is wrong and call to their colleague to stop.

He does not and with a shove, he finally breaks the seal on the ancient thing.

A strange clicking fills the air, growing in frequency and number until it sounds like a constant thrumming of cicadas though many times louder.  Purple tentacles, ropey and covered in thick translucent mucus whip from the tiny gap to entagle the Duergar.

The Duergar stands there, transfixed and smiling as he is engulfed by the spilling tendrils.

Something vast pulls itself free of its prison, something that has not walked the earth in three thousand years.

A wormlike beast of writhing tentacles and covered in a thick cloying mucus spills from the crystal sarcophagus, far too small to contain such a creature. Psudopod like tendrils reach for everyone around it and a psychic weight settles on all within the cavern…
