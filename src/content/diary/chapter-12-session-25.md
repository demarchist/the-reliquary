They awake the next morning on the northern shores of the Throat of Al Hawia and begin to make breakfast.

Jareem looks over the unconscious Doc B and inquires with the group about the small creature.

The group tells the Dragon that Doc is a small Gnomish Druid and they’re beginning to get quite concerned that their friend has not woken up.

Jareem uses his Psionics and confirms that Doc is being kept asleep by an exceedingly powerful spell.

Cirrus and Feanon look over their friend and determine it to be a very powerful (9th level) casting of the Dream spell.

Buumi comes over and begins to pray over his friend, asking for Helm and Carthus to wake the Druid.

JmJm joins the paladin and together, they manage to disrupt the spell enough for Doc to awaken.

Doc stirs with a dramatic yawn and looks around, blinking groggily.

The group gathers around, giving their friend a meal and telling him where they are, and what they are doing.

It takes a little bit to catch Doc up as the last thing the Druid remembers is fleeing the Amnians aboard a strange metal ship.

Jareem then goes on to mention what he thinks happened to Doc.

In all his time in Gaia, Jareem has noted the assassinations and killings of any and all druids by the forces of Zalaam/Vecna.

He thinks this dream spell was a ploy by Vecna to remove/kill Doc.

The group asks Jareem for more details and he continues.

The entire world is out of balance and the Druids would have been best equipped to try and fix it; which is why Vecna has been hunting them down.

Jareem has been working with the Elves of this land and their secret society: The Obsidian Order.

The dragon mentions that he is not the leader of it, but is a member of the council, and that the Order would likely be able to assist the group if they were to seek them out.

The group asks what the Order and he have been doing in the centuries to fight Zalaam and Jareem looks uncomfortable, looking around as if to ensure their privacy.

The dragon then goes on to speak in a hushed and secretive tone: He and the Elves managed to cleanse the temple of Horrah some time ago, but it has been kept secret and the goddess has been feigning her malady so to not alert Vecna that she is free to act.

Horrah alone cannot stop Vecna, but with the other gods being freed of the Corruption they might now stand a chance.

Feanon nods.  It makes sense to him that the Elves of this land would be working on something.

What this means going forwards though is anyone's guess.  

The current plans remain unchanged and the group breaks camp and they take flight, beginning the last leg of the journey to the city of Iyum.

Despite the altitude making the wind quite cold, the glare of two suns creates a situation for bad dehydration and the group battles the exhaustion of traveling under the Gaian suns.

With the miles passing beneath, the group turns their eyes to the coast, hoping to spot something interesting.

Off in the distance, they spot some carrion birds circling and they have Jareen veer over to take a look.

As they near, they realize the birds are much farther away than they first appeared, because the birds themselves are massive.

Gargantuan Vulture-like creatures with 80ft wing-spans circle a torn open ship that has been dashed against the rocky coast.

On the rocks are over a dozen corpses; human, dwarf, tabaxi, tiefling.

They spot smaller creatures, half feline, half eagle-like, avoiding the larger birds and darting in for a meal when the bigger bird gets distracted.

Not wanting to disturb the beasts, Doc B shapeshifts into an eagle himself and flies down to ask the Birds if the group can approach.

Doc returns shortly and says that as long as we don’t threaten them, or their food, we should be okay.

Jareem descends cautiously, using the rocky landscape to hide from the view of the gargantuan vultures as best he can.

The group looks for survivors, but find none.

In the back half of the rent ship, they find many chests and trunks.

They manage to pry open the luggage and find a great deal of money, art and noble-clothing and silks.

JmJm finds a particularly epic Turban.

A good haul.

The group takes the treasure and then they resume their journey to Iyum.

Before long, the shipwreck is far behind them.

After another few hours, they spot the telltale fires of humanoid populations on the horizon.

Before long, a city resolves itself in the distance - made of titanic stone edifices but now inhabited by the common folk of the land.

The city is ringed by a massive wall and clearly divided into districts, including an impressive harbor and a massive palace built into a small mesa dominating the center of the city.  Nearby the palace, a great tower of black stone juts into the sky.

The group decides to enter by the Northern gate - the Titans Gate that leads to Caravan Way. 

Jareem circles wide, still many miles from the city and flies down to land.

Behind a small sand dune, he shifts down into his Genasi form and the group picks up their packs and begin to walk along the nearby road.

The thing is clearly ancient, with massive stone blocks having shifted over the many centuries.

Old carved reliefs have been weathered almost smooth by the passage of time and two ruts have been worn into the top of the ancient road.

A thousand years of erosion from smaller carts than this road was once used by, has cut two divots into the stone of the old road.

The group begins along the well traveled, but sandy road; the city only a few miles ahead.

Group moves through caravan way outside the main gate, feanon meets some desert elves and sells a number of items to them.  The group then moves on to the gate, guard, abt to be inspected, buumi says liara and djoser and asks where to find them, says we are expected by them. Assumes part of “th excavation”.  Says liara is in the slums dealing with the blight outbreak. Djoser is in the brickyard - industrial district hiring good workers for “The excavation”.  Went through the gate and into Merchants District, moved through, started seeing noble district edge, went into a few shops including a gem shop to purchase 4 25gp diamonds while Patches steals them, she realizes she cannot steal the luster of gems which concerns her, the group moves on and as they move through the sandstone buildings, tents, wooden and stucco buildings and the ruins of ancient titanic streets, they come to a plaza.

The Plaza is filled with people and they are watching a speaker in a black robe.

On a wooden stage, a Speaker of Zalaam calls to the peasants of the city.

On stage with him are other cultists and a young woman.

The speaker is preaching to the crowd, saying how the world was ruined and now it must end - and end and be reborn by Zalaam.

Many of the peasants seem to agree and one of the cultists raises a knife above the girl.

The group, having moved closer to the cultists (recognizing them as enemies), calls out and Cirrus summons his wings, leaping into the air and arguing against the Speaker of Zalaam.

The crowd seems evenly split and guards can be seen moving on the outskirts of the plaza, led by a Tabaxi.

Tensions rise as the Speaker and Cirrus argue!
