The group retires back to the party, Feanon needing a long rest to recharge his Arcane batteries.

Though the whole group rests in the real world, in the Tavern at Blingdenstone, no one is affected by the abyssal energies permeating the Underdark, and everyone sleeps restfully.

The next morning, the group prepares to leave.

Gurnik and Chief Diggermattock meet the group as Feanon prepares to teleport the party back to the Barony for a much needed break from the Underdark.

The Deep Gnomes will call in their troops and spend a few days summoning earth elementals.

After one week, the group will return to Blingdenstone and with the Gnomes, launch an assault to the north and push the oozes, and potentially The Demon Lord Juiblex, out of the area.

The group asks after Snorbul and Thorna and find out they went north to parlay with the Were-rat warren.  Cirrus mentions his own Were-rat acolytes and promises to speak to both groups.

The group bids farewell for now, and teleports in a flash of Arcane brilliance.


They appear without incident at the Teleportation circle in Feanon’s Tower.

Everyone immediately feels a weight lifted from their minds; the abyssal energies of the Underdark, and it’s replaced with the brisk Spring morning air of Northern Faerun.

The Sun is rising, casting the Barony is a brilliant morning light, the towers and walls of the keep across the Valley shining in the morning sun.

Feanon peels off quickly into his laboratory, intent on checking on the Clone and Manshoon’s notes.

Everyone else heads out of the tower, to the boats and take them across the lake, the Fane, and then on to the town center itself.

Tark simply sprints across the water, heading back to his treehouse.

The group notices very quickly that a larger number of guards are visible than normal, many which the group have never seen before.

As the separated group each inquire and ask about the new Mercenary Band, they each find out that Bohd’s Band has been hired by Silverymoon to shore up the defenses of the Barony.

They also discover that Feanon will be busy for the next few days, as the Young Wizard of the Mercenary Band approaches Feanon, requesting Apprenticeship.

Cirrus makes it to his Fane and talks to Topsy and Turvey, the two Wererat Deep Gnomes.

He asks them if they are still lonely and mentions bringing the Wererats of Blingdenstone to the Barony.

Topsy and Turvey are unsure about this plan, but wish to at least meet their kin in Blingdenstone to talk it over.

Cirrus agrees and retires to his Sanctum to pray.

That night, he uses the Well of Many Worlds, opening a portal to the Ethereal Plane.

Uninterested in that place, Cirrus closes the Portal and returns to his meditation.


Patches is at her Establishment and gets a report from Mr. Pickles.

She finds out that two of the leaders of the Mercs are currently in her Establishment; Bohd himself and Miranda; Priestess of Sune.

Patches uses the wall tunnels to evesdrop on Bohd and discovers him to be a Half Orc with a mane of Crimson hair, red and gold armor and a massive Battleaxe.

She listens as he tells a story, fairly well, though Patches has no time for the bravado and cockiness of this one and loses interest quickly.

Leaving Bohd to his tale, Patches heads up to the suites to check out this “Miranda”.

Arriving at the third floor, Patches sees this priestess practically moving in, with several trunks worth of things being hauled in by villagers.

The priestess appears to be a Human woman in her twenties with sharp, but thin features.

She is wearing an elegant gown but has a large jeweled dagger on one hip and a prayer book next to it.

She turns to face Patches, showing a dark complexion with shockingly bright eyes and facepaint depicting sigils of Sune.

The woman smiles and introduces herself as Miranda, Warpriest of Sune.

Patches inquires why a Priestess of the Goddess of Love and Passion is practically moving in to her Estsblishment.

Miranda explains her position; She is the Warpriest of Bohd’s Band and perform vital healing magic for the company.  The rest of the time though, her job is to encourage passion in all its forms.  Including Escort services for the wealthy, the money from whom is then funneled to less fortunate artists, craftsmen or regular people: Anyone with a passion to be nurtured.

Patches says she will think it over and leaves the Priestess, with Miranda’s 500gp weekly rent in hand...


Gundren heads to his manufactory to see how things are going and show his brothers his Chardalyn Bells.

Hi brothers are suitably impressed and mention the Merc band and the fact it has a small company of Dwarven Sappers.

Curious, Gundren decides to invite Bohd to training to see what he’s made of and sends for the Dwarven Sappers to see how he can put them to use..

Checking the rest of the workshop, he notes that all the requested Dwarven Experts from Sundabar have arrived and have almost finished setting up their Work areas.

Gundren then heads to the Tavern for an evening meal with his friends to discuss Bohd, Miranda and the plans for Blingdenstone.


With the Weapons Master finally arrived from Silverymoon, Patches and Gundren (and who else?) spend the week training under Master Koh, a High Elf.

Over the week, several interesting events occur across the Barony:

Cirrus continues to open Portal after Portal with the Well of Many Worlds, desperate to find the Plane where Selune resides.

He has many portals open to the Ethereal over the week and one to Gehennah in the Lower Planes and another to The Outer Gates of Reality (which he quickly closes), until finally he gets something that intrigues him…

Casting the portal at the wall of his Sanctum, a rift appears and a white light floods into the Sanctum.

Through the portal is a strange sight.

An endless expanse of white fog and flat crystal ground.  Despite the ambient fog, visibility is good for several hundred feet and great hunched figures can be seen in the distance.  Scale is hard to read here, but the beings appear enormous.  

Cirrus steps through and closes the portal behind himself.

On the other side, the silence of the place is eerie and it smells like nothing.

Water or something water-like can be seen coalescing on the ground and then raining upwards.

The place is bizarre and Cirrus has never even heard of anything remotely like this.

He walks for twenty minutes, heading toward the closest “statue”

As he nears it, he finally sees some movement in the corner of his eye and he turns to look, but sees nothing...until he looks down into the reflections in the ground.

There, the reflections of the hunched figures can be seen moving toward Cirrus’ reflection.

Cirrus stands there waiting for the strange creatures.

They grow close and form a ring around him in the crystal ground reflection.  They appear to be made out of writhing masses of rubbery looking worms or tendrils.

One steps forward, reaching an appendage toward Cirrus, a tendril extending like a pulsating finger.

Cirrus Planeshifts away and immediately feels a sense of relief upon returning to the real world.

Only back in reality does he now realize just how bizarre and foreign that place truly was.

Unnerved, Cirrus heads to Feanon’s tower to speak with Beryan the Sage.

He finds her, at her desk with a pile of books in front of her and a large tome set out on a reading stand.

She welcomes Cirrus and he asks her if she has ever heard of the Plane he just visited.

She replies that she has not, but that could indicate The Far Realm as she is well versed in Planar Cosmology. A place outside of Reality.

Cirrus asks if anyone else has ever visited the Far Realm.

She says that actually, yes, and someone the group was having her look into: Abraxim, Elven boogie-man mentioned in the Elven ruins in the Chardalyn mines. He traversed the Outer Gates and came back infected, an Elder Evil lodged in his brain.

According to Legend, it took Sehanine Moonbow of the Elven Pantheon, an aspect of Selune, to drive Halashnar, The Pallid Prince from this world and cause Abraxim to flee…

Snorbul and Thorna are teleported back to the Barony and report that the Deep Gnomes continue to muster their forces.  Negotiation overtures have begun between the Gnomes and Wererats, though they are waiting for the groups return to have the meeting.

They also relay that initial reports indicate that the northern caverns of Blingdenstone are infested with oozes and demons of Ooze-like origin.

Snorbul then heads to check the progress on his Fighting pit and Thorna heads to the Keep to visit the Paladins of Helm.


Meanwhile at the training grounds Patches and Gundren have been putting in their training time.

Patches spends the week learning new maneuvers, while Gundren practices in Heavy Armor.

On the third day of this, Bohd joins at Gundren’s request.

Patches decides to test the Orc and invites him to step into the Arena with her.

Bohd agrees, grabs his practice blade and squares off against the formidable Dark Elf.

In a flurry of movement, Patches sweeps Bohd to the ground and slams him with her weapon.

Dazed, he roars, stands and begins to swing with hi practice axe.

He’s good though and despite never landing a *solid* hit, he continually glances the Rogue.

Patches retaliates, tripping him to the ground again and smacking him.

Bohd roars louder and comes back swinging, pushing Patches backwards.

They go back and forth like this for almost a minute until Patches tries for a third trip attack.

Finally having learned her trick, Bohd jumps the strike but takes a pommel to the face.

He swings back at Patches, but she expects the attack, and ripostes, finally laying Bohd on his back, the large Half-Orc now bloodied and breathing heavily.

He growls in frustration but then grins and yields, standing to his feet unsteadily as master Koh hands him and Patches healing potions.

He’s pretty good, though no match for any of The Heralds.  A good addition to the FDF.

Bohd heads back to Over the Moon for lunch, and runs into Cirrus.

They chat for a little while and it comes up that Bohd’s mount is a Blood-drinker Wyvern named Kim.

Cirrus asks if he can see her and Bohd does one better, inviting the Warlock to come by for her morning feeding.

Cirrus arrives early the next morning to the Keep’s courtyard, spotting Bohd standing out in a crimson suit, sword at his hip and leading a sheep on a leash.

In front of him, across the courtyard, is the Temple of Helm.

Cirrus can see that a part of the copper roof has opened, revealing a hatch and an makeshift, Aviary.  Basking in the morning sun, it’s crimson feathers reflecting the light is the Wyvern.


Cirrus slaughters the Sheep and the massive reptilian creature lets out roar and takes flight, extending sinuous limbs and gliding down to devour the slaughtered creature.

Living up to its name, the Wyvern laps up the blood and Bohd begins to brush and groom the creature.

It strikes Cirrus that this is a natural creature, unlike dragons and the evidence is in its proportions.  There’s no magic here, just natural excellence and beauty.

Cirrus thanks Bohd for the experience.

Bohd also mentions that he can extract venom from Kim every now and then, just let him know when a dose is required.

Cirrus thanks the Half-Orc and says he will let Patches know.

He then takes his leave.


One evening, as the group is having dinner in Over the Moon, the front doors swing open and in walks a bejeweled Dwarf-Lord, flanked by two bodyguards.

The Lord spots Gundren at the large table and strides forward, introducing himself as Dogan of Clan Battlehammer, Smith and Artificer.

They clasp hands and Gundren even bows a little.

Dogan then goes on to explain that he cannot stay long, he has invitations to deliver and hands an ornate granite box to Gundren.

Inside the velvet lined box is a veritable brick of Jade, carved and engraved with the runes of Clan Battlehammer, Gauntlgrym and the Delzoun Empire.

Dogan explains that in one months time, all ten being invited by royal decree, are to meet in in Gauntlgrym and present an invention, work of Artifice or Enchantment to help the Northern nations in their war with Amn and Thay.

The winner of the “competition” will have unfettered access to the forges of Gauntlgrym and the Dawn Titan Maegara

Dogran looks again at the Thundercannon and Gwen, smiles and says he is looking forward to seeing what the Rockseeker Manufactory will produce.

He then says he’s heard the place has some good Goblin Fights and Dwarven Blackjack in the basement and is led downstairs by Gundren to the raucous cheers of the Dwarven miners as they are informed their bar tab is being picked up by The Dwarven Empire.


The rest of the week is rather uneventful and the group gets a much needed respite.  Indeed, it seems like for the first time in months, the group can finally catch their breath...
