**The Dark Iron City**

**​**Hemeth takes the vessel out onto the last stretch of the Darklake before the Duergar city.

The group asks him a number of questions and work on Gundrens disguise.

They realize that the bureaucracy of the city will most likely be the real headache and decide to lay low, using Hemeth's contacts in the **Grey Ghosts** to get illicit papers.

The vessel approached the **Chain Towers** defending the city from approach via the Darklake.

Lake-floor to cavern ceiling, the massive towers are grand fortifications covered in metal nodules, each glowing softly with a spot of warm light.

Duergar can be seen patrolling the tower fortifications and massive grey skinned giants, wearing finely crafted leathers and wielding long lances of crystal can be seen at each of the towers - Stone Giants.

Tark flashes the light signal to the closest tower as they pass per Hemeth's instruction.

As they pass the Chain towers, they note correctly that massive chains can be raised from below the water to defend the bay and that the towers themselves are covered in carvings; constructs that would come alive to defend the towers.

Fey is impressed and a touch confused until Hemeth welcomes the group to the Duergar Capital of Gracksuluth.

The stench of the place is overwhelming. Sulfur, oil, coal and the harsh tang of metal and smog is everywhere.  Even the water shows a disgusting sheen of chemicals on its surface as the ship approaches the main docks.

Hemeth veers away from the main docks however, a longing look on his face as he takes his ship far away from the hustle and bustle of the Blade Bazaar, the largest market in the city.

The paddle steamer trundles through the waterways, underneath massive Iron and Steel cranes and passing warehouses.

Hemeth takes the ship to a run down dock, out front of an abandoned warehouse.

Snorbul leaps to the ramshackle dock and Hemeth tosses him the ropes, securing the ship.

Cirrus notes a Duergar walking through the abandoned industrial park toward the ship, he points it out to the group.  They see no one and call out to the invisible Duergar.

A Duergar with a bush, curly beard, a perfectly bald head, Bowler hat and heavy overcoat and boots becomes visible, amber eyes glowing softly beneath bush white eyebrows.

Hemeth calls out to the newcomer, naming him **Chadle**.

Turns out Chadle is Hemeths contact with the city underbelly, his fence with whom he smuggles in art and other contraband.

Chadle sees the group and sees an opportunity, and the group sees their way into the city.

They negotiate with the Duergar and purchase three sets of work papers off him immediately and pay to have Snorbul registered as a legitimate slave to ensure no other Duergar will capture the poor Snirfneblin.

Snorbul is assured by Fey that they will be taking him home and the deep gnome believes him.

Chadle invites the group to dine with him this evening in the Shattered Spire, where he will deliver the rest of their papers and a middling - noble ID badge to Gundren, who Chadle believes to be a foreign Duergar.

Hemeth and Chadle head toward the Shattered spire but mention returning shortly the move the ship to a more permanent dock.

The group heads off toward** The Gholbrorn's Lair**, the large complex of apartments, shops and restaurants for foreigners in the city (told to them by Patches and Hemeth).

The group makes good progress through the warhouse district and along the waterfront.  

Patches points out the smithing complex of **Clan Anvilthew**, enticing Gundren to come back later to fix Gwen, Patches also mentions she has contacts in the clan and wishes to speak with them.

They pass a massive ore refinery, and then the smithing complex of **Clan Steelshadow, **the largest weapons makers in the city.

Passing these massive factories, the group notes the sheer amount of slave labor present in the city.

Unlike the Drow that appear to take a sadistic pleasure in torturing their slaves, the Duergar approach is far more practical.

The slaves look dirty, but well fed and quite hardy, undergoing intense manual labor, but taken care of to ensure efficiency.

The group notes that many of the slaves are working with harsh chemicals.  One even falls into a large pile of some substance.

As the slave thrashes, two Duergar rush forwards and haul the slave out, dragging him quickly to a water-bath where he is drenched. 

It's not due to any caring nature, but to protect their investments and ensure efficiency...

Most of the slaves appear to be Orcs, Goblins and other underdark denizens though the occasional human, elf or other surface dwellers are spotted (but rare).

As the group goes they notice another population, the homeless vagrants, present in every city.

Strangely though, that population in **Gracksuluth **appears to be entirely **Derro,** the strange mad, mutant Dwarf-kin.

Passing the massive Duergar complexes, the group notes the deceptive scale of the place - all of the smaller rock formations having long been cleared away, leaving only truly massive stone support pillars, reinforced by Duergar engineering.  Fortifications and architectural complexes abound, build around each support pillar in a sprawl of industrialization that none of the party has ever seen before save for Patches.

Passing through the Blade Bazaar, the group stops by a small clothing store, picking up Duergar clothing for Gundren and Tark (who ever since arriving in the city has been under the guise of Tark-Spidermenn)

As Fey spots their destination, he pushes through the crowded market, spotting Deep Gnomes with Earth Elemental bodyuards, Drow in their distinctive Piwafwi cloaks and even a human man.  Quickly though, he comes face to face with a being he's only ever heard of as he almost runs into a large floating glass tank, lined with intricate metalwork.

A great face resolves itself within the cloudy liquid of the tank - an Aboleth

Fey and the creature exchange a few words telepathically, but the creature quickly loses interest and the floating tank moves on.

Fey rushes to catch up and implores it for an audience.  The creature reluctantly agrees, letting Fey know that it is staying in The Gholbrorn's Lair and will be there for several more days.  A name resolves itself in Fey's Mind: **Panoptes of The Sovereignty.**

The group pushes on and arrives at the Foreigner's residences, entering the massive stone column that makes up the majority of the complex.

Inside, the group finds a large courtyard, the interior of the pillar hollowed out to a height of at least 150ft, buildings constructed in ascending levels atop one another.

The group sees the cheapest residences on the lower floors, cafe's and restaurants on the ground floor with tables and seating areas around warm braziers.

The sulfurous smell of the exterior city is somewhat lessened here and foreigners can be seen enjoying food and drink.

The lack of music is stark though.  The surface world was filled with the sounds of street performers and bards.  Down here though, only the constant hum of machinery, clang of metal and chattering talk fills the air.

  

**Building #2**

​The group ascends almost to the top floor of the **Gholbrorn** and along one wall of the place see a classy establishment and enter.

The interior is dark granite, immaculately crafted and trimmed with black marble.  The Furniture is perfectly crafted from stone and hardwoods (likely Zurkhwood).

A large hearth crackles against one wall, a Deep Gnome relaxing in one of the larger chairs, reading a book while a Duergar in fine clothes drinks from a dark cup at one of the tables.

The common area is a large T, with one wing holding the hearth, tables and chairs, and the other functioning as the entryway with a long counter behind which sits a female halfling with greying hair.

Down the hallway, the group can see four staircases that lead to townhouses.

They approach the counter and begin talking to the enslaved halfling **Nedda Bigheart**, her large eyes showing a weariness and her face having a subtle, empty smile.

The group are concerned for her and discover the situation of her enslavement, she works for the owner of the establishment, paying off her slave debt and working toward buying her freedom.  She says she still has many years to go and grows quiet when pressed about further details.

The group rents one of the townhouses from her and head inside to drop off their things. 

Doc B, JmJm and Cirrus remain behind as the others decide to head to visit **Clan Anvilthew **before dinner with **Chadle**.

They have Nedda summon two Rickshaws for the group.

While leaving **The Gholbrorn**, Patches spots four Drow on the level above them, guarding an apartment complex...she recognizes the facility as the Drow "**Embassy"** a permanent rental by the all major noble houses of **Menzoberranzan**.

​On the ground floor, the group get in their Orc-drawn Rickshaws and begin heading through the city.

As they leave the Blade Bazaar, they all turn in their seats and a massive rumbling emanates behind them.

One of the massive sets of Adamantine doors separating the districts of the city is opening, the engraved faces of the door showing it to be covered in defensive constructs.

The dozens of guards by the gate fan out to allow a massive creature to waddle through the gargantuan gate.

A massive Red Dragon moves forward, it's body rippling oddly (for a dragon) with fat and accompanied by many Duergar in red robes and armor.

The Rickshaw driver names it as **Themberchaud The Wyrmsmith**. The Dragon apparently fueling and lighting the forges of the city.

Themberchaud waddles into the Smithing complex of Clan **Steelshadow**.

  

**Anvilthew**

The Rickshaws get the group back to the docks far faster than moving on foot as they can use designated pathways for transport.

Arriving at The **Anvilthew **factory, an important looking Duergar exits the building as the Rickshaws approach, sensing some wealthy customers.

He introduces himself as **Legran an Avilthew **and leads the group inside.

After a quick negotiation, **Patches **drops the name Bregan D'Aerthe and what she needs is for their infiltrators.

Understanding, Legran leads the group to two artificers that specialize in the equipment - Patches explaining to the group that the Duergar were the ones to develop a lot of her gear.

Patches asks **Legran **to look into an old contact of hers with the clan, a skilled slave laborer named **Claudine.**

**Legran **takes his leave to investigate.

Gundren begins to negotiate renting a workshop and assistant to begin repairing Gwen, the mechanical lion. 

As the resupply for Patches goes through, the Duergar craftsmen bringing in crates of raw materials, money is exchanged (Platinum).

**Fey'Anon **opens his bag of holding to drop the supplies into and a blast of sand, dust and wind hits him in the face.

This strange whirlwind of sand blows past the group, out into the hallway and disappears quickly from sight.

Not thinking, Tark immediately pursues, as does Gundren.

In the workshop, they finish packing the supplies and Guards show up at the commotion.

The bottom of Fey's stomach drops a little when he realizes what has happened and he calls out to the guards and the Duergar that he thinks a **Mummy Lord **has just been let lose.

Fey checks the contents of his bag of holding and realizes it has stolen the ancient Netherese Battleaxe - Grace and the the Aurum Spell Scrolls.  Fey Panics.

Patches and Fey rush after the Mummy Lord, blowing past the guards to call for them to halt. The two party members dropping non-lethal spells behind them to slow the pursuit.

Tark and Gundren track the creature to a nearby Store-room, but the door is locked.

A young Duergar comes to investigate the commotion and introduces himself as **Gil**

Gil is not convinced at first and tries to usher the group away and back to the storefronts and workshops.

Gundren finally manages to convince him to at least let them check the store room.  Gil opens the door with a massive ring of keys.

Fey and Patches catch up to the group, the clatter of pursuit beginning to grow louder.

As Tark, Patches and Gundren enter the store room, the Mummy lord drops from above, behind them.

The undead monster turns, loose linens flapping, wielding the leaf-shaped battleaxe Grace and with three golden scroll tubes tucked into it's waist.

It embeds the axe into poor Gil, almost bisecting the Dwarf.

It then turns to sand and rushes away.

Tark shadowsteps in pursuit, and with an incredible act of dexterity manages to scoop the blowing trail of sand into his own Bag of Holding...

The guards catch up and see the dead Duergar, readying their weapons to arrest the group.

Luckily though, the Artificers who had seen the creature corroborated the groups story about an undead monster, the group taking the Amber-encased heart of the thing from their bag and handing it to the guards to smash it.

They try but cannot scratch the egg.

**Legran **returns and investigates the body, noting that it too lines up with the story as none of the group carry a weapon that could leave the wounds present on Gil.

The group promises to resurrect **Gil** and Patches is sent to pick up **JmJm, Doc B** and **Cirrus** from the town house under armed escort.

As she is leaving, the egg still completely unharmed, the withered heart still untouched within, Fey has an idea.

**Themberchaud** can breathe on the egg and destroy it.

**Legran agrees **and the group exits the **Avilthew **facilities to head toward the lair of the Red Dragon.

Outside they are greeted by dozens of Plate wearing armed guards and two Stone Golems and are escorted out of the Darklake District, through a set of gargantuan doors and through to **Laduguer's Furrow **the main residence area of the city for it's native population.

Patches makes it back to the town house, sending Doc and JmJm to go and bring back **Gil** while she and **Cirrus **are escorted to meet up with the group heading toward the Dragon.

They cross over the massive chasm that splits the city in two, bridges a hundred feet wide span the chasm at every level, buildings carved directly into the rock face above and below.

Many geothermal chimneys can be seen here, disgorging gasses directly into the air.

Many of these vents have devices capping them, trapping the gasses as they are expelled.  

Many more have Duergar, held aloft by strange balloon-like devices, with long poles, holding devices linked by hoses into the stream of gasses.

The city is a bustle of activity here, no less than the Darklake District. 

The main distinction being that no foreigners are normally allowed here, only Duergar and Stone Giants.  Indeed, as the group is escorted they attract quite a deal of attention.

After over an hour of walking, the group finally arrives at the other side of the city, **Patches** and **Cirrus** catching up to their friends.  

They note the air is much hotter here, cloying with humidity and it burns their lungs with volcanic fumes.  The smell of sulfur is overwhelming.

Before the escorted group is a massive Brass door, shimmering with heat. 

Red robed and armored Duergar guard the gates. Gates large enough for the great Wyrm to pass through with ease...
