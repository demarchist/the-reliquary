**Petey Greene, Money Launderer Extraordinaire**

The group begins to settle in on the ship, taking a much needed breather.

** **Twenty minutes goes by before they are interrupted as one of the newly freed slaves approaches them.

Going below decks, the group surveys the scene of 32 newly freed people sitting around, hungry and unsure what they should do next.

**​**The group decides that a feast is in order and pours out the Ewer of Feasting, creating a banquet (though not enough food for 32) and supplementing it with stores found in the hold of the ship.

As the grateful folk feast, an older Half Orc woman approaches and introduces herself as **Keerna**.

Talking with the group, she tells them that they have very little and are unsure what to do, they were all grabbed from the slums after all.

The group brings up the possibility of working on a temple of Selune within the city, but Keerna is less than optimistic, wondering why they would let her and the other slaves work on something like that.

Then it is brought up that the Barony could always use more people.  Cirrus immediately jumps on the idea and the others agree, telling the newly freed slaves of opportunities in the East.

Keerna likes the idea but has some concern about making it out past the Evermoors in the middle of winter, and with absolutely no financing.

Hearing this, Tark pulls out a handful of gold and hands it to her (120gp) and hopes that its enough to pay for supplies and support.

Keerna takes the fortune (to her) and tears up, never having held so much money, or seen so much in her life.

The other slaves gather and begin to cheer, their fortunes having shifted so dramatically. They swear to take the gold and create a caravan and head for **Selunia**, the Barony at Thunder Bluff.

They mention that with that kind of gold, they could probably get a full caravan to emigrate from the slums.  The group mentions that they would welcome any with with open arms and that upon arrival they should seek out **Li Tan** for work and they will find land and pay waiting for them.

**Keerna** and the other ex-slaves gather and begin to talk among themselves and the group leaves them be.  

They head up to the main deck upon hearing a whistle from the docks to get their attention.

A city guard captain;** Captain Lendeer** has arrived at the Wharf where the ***Silent Virtue*** is roped up and asks to come aboard and is granted permission.

The human captain hops on a small dinghy and rows over, climbing up to the deck and greets the party.  He mentions that he heard that the ship had been captured by ***The Heralds***.

Further explanation reveals that there are enough eyes on the docks that bringing the ship in was enough for people to figure out what had happened and that any attempts at controlling the information of the ship's liberation are moot - he heard through Dock contacts.

**Lendeer** goes on to mention that if the group has any further leads, they should follow them now as news is spreading. 

The group informs the Captain of their information regarding **Petey Greene** and the mysterious box delivered to "**Priss"** at the ***Sallow Manatee.  ***

The captain uses a sending stone to contact his men. 

They will bring in troops to cut off the city block. The troops will be in position within twenty minutes.

Too slow for the groups taste, they decide to move on *The Sallow Manatee Inn*.

As they go to leave *The Silent Virtue, ***Lendeer** becomes uncomfortable and mentions that due to city law, the Ship is not theirs by default, that it is to be remanded into custody of the City Watch, though the group will get first right of refusal to purchase the ship at a steep discount if they wish.

The group thinks this bullshit, but don't argue the point with more pressing matters to attend to.

Heading from the ship to the docks, the group rushes to T*he Sallow Manatee, *the inn they were at earlier in the day with **Lo'Dan**.

Approaching the Inn, the group sees that the the two story building is dark on the first floor, but has two lit windows on the second.

Patches quickly scales the outside of the structure to peer within the lit windows. She sees one unoccupied room with a low burning oil lamp and another with an older gentleman curled up in bed.

dropping to the ground level, she lets the group know and they approach the main door.

Checking the front door (noting the boarded over hole from Gundren's shotgun blast earlier in the day) Patches discovers the door is wired with a Black Powder charge and goes about disarming it.

Halfway through the disarm, Patches realises that it's a false fuse and tells the group to clear the area, diving out of the way just as the charge detonates, blasting the door (and a chunk of the wall) from its hinges and showering the area in splinters.

The group rushes inside, Gundren with his Thundercannon aflame.

The darkened common room of the inn is devoid of any movement but the group hears a commotion from the back of the room, from the stairs leading down to the cellar. 

Cirrus disguises himself as **Vaas** just as a voice calls out, asking "who goes there".

Cirrus calls back doing an excellent impersonation of Vaas, saying the gig is up and that **Petey** should surrender and hand himself in.

The barrel of a blunderbuss pokes around the corner of the wall and the fat, balding head of Petey appears looking down the sights.

Confused, Petey does not lower his weapon, spotting the heavily armed group and recognizing them from earlier, going pale.  Scanning the group, he locks eyes with Fey'Anon...and drops unconscious in a heap (I re-read this ability, this is not how it works lol).

The group moves in, heading for the stairs down as Patches climbs back to the second story and slips into the unoccupied room.

Up above, Patches investigates the rooms of the Inn, heading down the hall until she sees light from underneath one door (not the one with the sleeping man) and smells the faint scent of burnt paper.

Unlocking the simple door, she slips inside and sees the room completely tossed, mattress on the ground, desk flipped, a small cot in one corner and the ash of a stack of paper in the fireplace.  A half-burned sheet of paper just on the edge of the fireplace, the window open to the alley and a large quantity of metallic purple dust scattered on the ground near the overturned desk.

Patches rushes forwards and grabs the half burned paper, turning out to be a letter detailing some kind of shadowy plan occurring in the city.

**...Items provided by the bene...full sum has been paid in advance, with another thous...whichever...the Lord's Head. We have eyes on each...not alone, other allies are on the...signal...wait and will not move unless discovered or the...no quarter will be given for agents caught in the...agent working the sea is messy...good hunting Stalker...**

Down below, the group moves to the stairs down to the cellar, seeing no one and move down further.

In the cellar, they see a well disguised trap door open and a ladder leading down to a second cellar from which they hear quite a bit of movement.

Tark moves in and peers over the side, seeing a crossbow pointed in his direction by the large Orog he saw earlier in the day, **Gleg**.

Gleg fires, reloads and fires again with both bolts going heinously wide.

Tark drops down next to him and tells him to drop the crossbow, which he does.  Tark seems to catch on that Gleg might not be the sharpest knife in the draw and tells the large goblinoid to then "watch the crossbow" and the huge creature pulls out a shortsword and begins eyeing the dropped weapon.

Across the room, Tark sees **Jenny**, the redheaded bouncer woman from earlier pocketing a large number of silver ingots into a sack.

Gundren and Gwen hop down next to Tark and Jenny raises her hands in surrender, noting the arrival of the dangerous group.

Gleg mentions that the Crossbow aint moved, but he's keeping a good eye on it.  Everyone feels a little bad fro Gleg.

Jenny sighs and asks to trade being turned into the guard for information. It takes a bit of convincing, including the silver ingots, but the group agrees.

Jenny tosses them the bag of silver and spills the info, detailing that they had nothing to do with the people trafficking, that they moved the money, melting down gold and silver from the slaves and the pirate coin into ingots to then be moved out of the city.  Their goldsmith is **Blek Bleckson** in the Tower District.  They ask her about the mysterious metal box delivered to a "Priss" but she has no idea.

With the silver, and a lead, they let Jenny flee into the sewers.  

Gleg thinks the Crossbow might be done with whatever shenanigans it may have been up to and sheaths his sword.  The group feels sorry for the oaf and sends him off to the docks to Keerna to head to Thunder Bluff with the other freed slaves.

The group heads back out onto the street, Patches joining the others and showing them the burned letter she found and mentioning the strange metallic dust scattered in the room.

Mulling over the information in the letter, the metal dust and the lead from Jenny, the group is approached by **Captain Lendeer** and are told that the perimeter is established.  The group tells him their incursion was successful and ask about Blek but the captain does not know the goldsmith.  They thank the man, telling him **Jenny** fled into the sewers and having them pick up the unconscious **Petey Greene** and taking the poor smuggler into custody.

Thinking time is of the essence, despite it being midnight, the group decides to head to the Tower District to track down **Blek, **the money laundering goldsmith.

**The Thayan Drop Box**

​The group has the guard call them a carriage to ferry them up to The Tower District.

Arriving past midnight, the financial and craftsman center of the city is not particularly active.  The group comes across some patrolling guards and asks if they know where Blek Blekson has his shop.

One guard has no idea, but the other remembers and directs them down a culdesac to a two story blue building with a stone stair on the front heading down to a cellar.

The carriage parks and everyone gets out, except Fey, who remains in the vehicle reading his books.  

The carriage driver sits awkwardly up front, waiting.

Approaching the house/workshop of Blek, Patches and Tark head around back, through an alley and approach the back door. Cirrus (re-disguising himself as Vaas) and Gundren approach the front and knock.

After a few minutes of knocking, a gruff voice comes up the stairwell from the cellar and they turn to see a sleepy, and annoyed looking Dwarf with scraggly, receding black hair and a beard tied into a braid.  Blek.

Around back, Patches picks the back door lock (blasting it with a powder charge) where she and Tark head inside for a quick look around.  They hear Blek addressing their friends out front.

Gundren and Cirrus approach the Dwarf who looks over Vaas, having heard the name but never met the woman, asking what their business is.  They reply that the gig is up with the money laundering.  Just as Blek gets suspicious, Gundren smashes the butt of his cannon into the Dwarf's face, dropping him unconscious to the ground.

Inside the workshop, Patches and Tark head upstairs, looking for anything out of the ordinary.  Finding an office, they see a journal laying open on the desk written in Dwarvish and snatch it up to take to Gundren to read.

They head out the front door to see Blek's unconscious form at the bottom of the stairwell.  Tark reprimands Gundren for beating the poor Dwarf unconscious. Sighing, they drag Blek into the cellar abode and tie the Dwarf up.

Blek stirs a little, tied up, with Gwen's adamantite claws resting on his chest.

Patches hands Blek's journal over to Gundren and he begins flipping through.  He sees quite a bit about a rivalry with a nearby Watchmaker named **Leister Bana** and learns that Blek has been spying on him. After a little while, Gundren gets to the more recent entries and notes that Bleks spies saw a strange delivery to the Watchmaker - a metallic purple box, seamless and delivered in the dead of night.  It matches the description of the box Vaas gave to Priss that the group was unable to recover.

Deciding that they've ruined this guy's night enough, they leave him unconscious and head back to the street level, easily spotting another workshop four houses down with an ornate clockwork sign over the door - Leister's shop.

Patches pulls her cloak up high and leaves the group milling around the carriage.  Heading over to the Watchmaker's shop, she does a circuit, checking out the front and back, spotting some other shady individuals going about their own business.  Checking the front door, she finds it locked but not overly complicated.  She checks the back, finding the same lock on the back door.  Pulling out her thieves tools, Patches quickly unlocks the back door, opens it enough to check for traps, spots one and disarms that, all within a handful of seconds and slips inside the workshop.

Looking around, Patches sees a number of clockwork contraptions but nothing that catches her eye.  She sees a stair heading up to a second story and a closet leading into a storage space.  Heading into the storage, Patches begins looking around, checking every box.  

Just as she's about to give up, she spots a smaller box covered in a white sheet.  Pulling the sheet off, she sees the glitter of purple metal and she sees the seamless metal box mentioned in Bleks Journal.

Patches picks up the box, finding it to be VERY heavy for its size. Patches finds a box that could pass and covers it with the sheet and heads from the workshop, hauling this strangely heavy box with her and returning to the group.

Placing the box in the carriage, Fey takes a look at it, feeling strong abjuration, transmutation and enchantment magic emanating from the strange box.  He has no idea how to open it.

Realising that they probably will have to question Leister about the box, Patches heads back into the workshop to see if the man lives there.  Ascending the stairs to the second story, Patches checks the rooms and finds a human man and woman sleeping in a four poster bed.

Patches slips up to the sleeping man, Platinum mask on her face and holds Neero's blade to his throat, waking the man with a finger to his lips.  The man awakes, eyes going wide staring into the amber eyes behind the mask.

stumbling from bed, Patches leads the man downstairs to the workshop to be questioned by the group.  The panicking man does his best to answer the questions but the group quickly discovers that he has no idea what the box is.  He was paid to store it, and then give it to someone for 100g who was there to pick it up later that day.  That is all he knows.

The group decides that Leister needs to go on a vacation and that they will man the store to try and entrap the person coming to pick up the box.  Tark pulls out 190gp and hands it to the man.  Super confused, Leister takes the gold, wondering if he's being robbed or not.  Patches takes back 100gp and the man is a little crestfallen but doesn't push his luck.

The plan is solidified and the group will run the store to see who picks up the box.

The man stammers, asking if he can get his wife and go and the group agrees, though Cirrus begins following Leister asking him his life's story to make the disguise more convincing.

Leister and his wife head out through the back and the group settles in to rest for the remainder of the night.  Cirrus plops down in the four poster bed...laying there...wide awake as he does not sleep.  Fey finally decides to get out of the carriage and walks into the store, plopping down into a chair upstairs to take his reverie.

Hours go by and the sun rises, waking the group from a much too short rest.  Tark begins to cook a small breakfast for them while Patches finishes praying to Elistraee and begins to don her disguise kit and haves some tea.

Cirrus heads down to the workshop, no idea what to do with all the clockwork, but begins to "work" and looks very convincing doing it.  Eventually, Patches (looking like Mrs. Bana) heads to the front of the shop and flips the closed sign to open. Her disguise immaculate. Tark hides in a grandfather clock. Gundren is upstairs, gun aflame.

After doing a little bit of business (handing an older wealthy lady her order and some other less eventful customers) a halfling man enters the shop.

Spotting the perusing halfling, the mans features mostly obscured by a wide brimmed hat, Patches approaches and asks if she can help him.  He says he is just window shopping, hands her his card which simply reads **"Holst"** and leaves the store.  The rest of the morning goes by relatively uneventfully and the group begin to think that the Halfling may have been the one here to pick up the box but somehow saw through the disguises.

Fey receives a sending from Buumi asking the group where they are as he was expecting them for breakfast with his family.  He tells them that the Amnians are to be staying at the estate and the delegation consists of** S'Olaa Al Kayan, Abdul Al Selemchant, Leigham Al Selemchant, Gneiss, Chani and Whistler.**  Buumi recognises some of the names and wants Cirrus to come by and give them a briefing on what he knows.

The group decides to head out and return to the estate.  They lock up the store and begin heading through the streets, though Patches keeps an eye out for the halfling from earlier.  The tower district is bustling with activity.

Patches spots a halfling with a large hat moving away from her carrying a large box.  His dress is similar enough that she thinks it could be him.  She heads off to tail him while the others begin heading back to the Bumidere estate.

Following the halfling, he turns into a haberdasher and looks to be returning a hat.  As the halfling pulls off his own, revealing blonde hair and cherubic features, there's a spark of recognition from Patches and she realises this is the halfling from the Bumidere estate - **Thessalt**.

Thessalt leaves the store and Patches resumes following him.

Meanwhile, the group discusses what to do about the purple box.  They mull over subcontracting a team of adventurers but end up not bothering. Fey brings up the possibility of talking with** Lemerlais** but is largely ignored.

Patches calls out the name "Holst" but the halfling keeps walking.  Patches decides to peel off, frustrated and head back to join the group having hit a dead end.

Approaching the group as she catches up, Patches notes Gundren peel off as they pass the keep.  She arrives just in time to hear Fey say "DONT YOU DARE!".

Gundren approaches the guards and asks to see Mordenkainen but finds out that he left the city for Helm's Hold, as did **Archmage Delly**.  Cirrus and Gundren take the box and using Instant Messenger, send the box with a note to Mordenkainen, much to Fey's dismay.

They keep moving toward the Bumidere estate.

Around ten minutes later, Cirrus gets a sending from Mordenkainen and they are told that what they sent to him was a Thayan Drop Box.  It can only be accessed by one with the password and trying any other way would result in a Glyph of Power Word: Kill going off.  It it extremely deadly.  They ask Mordy to do his best to open it and he sighs and says he will try.

The group remembers the card they got from Holst and Fey attempts to scry on the halfling, but the spell is resisted.

**Return to the Estate**

**​**The group walks leisurely through the Blue Lake District, approaching the Bumidere estate.  

The guards recognise the group and open the front gates and the group begins to head down the gravel driveway to the front door of the estate.

As they move through the gardens, the group notices **Mr. Shon** and the younger children of the family (including Georg's) having a lesson by a large fountain.

The group moves in to try and listen and note that the black robed, older man is reading them a history of the city of Neverwinter and the children are actually paying attention.

Patches moves in and asks what the man is doing. With an arrogant sneer, the man replies "teaching to avoid repeating the errors of history".

The group moves off, heading into the manor, thinking about the strange man and the odd vibes they are getting from him, wondering if he's secretly a necromancer or Amnian spy...

Entering the manor, they are shown to the dining room where Buumi, his brothers** Ernst and Kurt and Lord Bumidere** are taking brunch and engaging in small talk.

The group sits for a bite and learn that the Amnians are delayed, heading straight to Helm's Hold later that day and then retiring to the Bumidere estate after initial talks at the hold (much to Esimir's annoyance).  The names of the amnians are repeated and the group recognises two of the retainers - Gneiss and Chani as the monk and halberd wielding fighter they fought in Silverymoon during the Amnian Coup.

Buumi looks over the group and notes they look exhausted and the group recounts the nights events.

As the group mentions the Thayan Drop Box, Esimir perks up and notes that he has heard of such devices and that the Thayans were invited to the Council but they heard no response.  He also mentions that the Thayans attempted to conquer the city eighty years ago.

Finally remembering who the Thayans are and their connection to the undead, Gundren is convinced that the drop box has to do with Zhengyi and Atropos and not the slave trade, despite Patches saying not to jump to conclusions.

Patches excuses herself and pens a letter with her Spanreed quill to Lady Faye to inquire about the Thayans as the group asks the Bumidere's at the table if there are any Thayans in the city.  They know of none.

As they all chow down on a full, proper breakfast (what this means is a source of much debate) Buumi brings up that he would like to head to Helm's Hold that afternoon as he needs to take The Trial's of the Crusader.  No one knows what that is, even Buumi as he had a dream about it (that he believes is from Helm) and just knows that it's a Paladin thing he must do.  When in Silverymoon, he had Vigilant Master **Thelm** send word to the Hold to set it up.  To expedite travel, Lord Bumidere has procured the teleport Sigil for the Hold, provided by The Lord's Alliance.

Gundren insists on sleeping but the group considers heading right back out to the Hold, after all, they can rest there if Buumi has to do something come evening.

Buumi heads upstairs to get his things.

Patches heads back from writing her letter to lady Faye.  As she does, she spots **Val Tengu**, the Bumidere family bodyguard looking out each window and checking them.  Doing a security sweep.

Not looking back at her, he says "Drow, eh?" noticing that she was moving behind him (no small feat) and he initiates a conversation. He lets her know that he has read Buumi's letters and he's pretty sure Patches is "one of the good guys" but he tells Patches not to hurt Buumi and then walks off.

There are no sketchy or interesting characters at the Bumidere estate so the group preps their teleport circle, Fey bringing out the elaborate chalks to begin inscribing it on the ground.

As they are leaving, Patches spots a halfling enter the estate, one that looks almost identical to the one she was following in The Tower District. As she watches, the small man lets out a series of hacking coughs, proclaims he doesn't feel well and heads off to "his rooms" asking a servant not to be disturbed.

Watching, Patches thinks the coughing faked and follows the man to his room. He enters and locks the door behind him.  Patches peers through a sliver in the keyhole and watches as the halfling sits at a desk takes his hat off, showing a mop of blonde hair, and begins to write a letter.

Down at brunch, as the group leaves, Kurt also stands to leave.  He mentions he needs to check on his boyfriend, a halfling named Thessalt. 

As Patches and the group meet back up, Patches lets the group know that a halfling matching the description of the one they saw earlier is in the barony with them.  

The group tells her that it's probably Thessalt, the boyfriend of Kurt Von Bumidere.

They decide to keep an eye on him and not barge in and attack the man.

Putting a few things together, the group decides that there is most likely an assassination plot in motion. As they are saying this, Patches receives a note from her contacts saying no information on Holst has been found but they are making inquiries.

Buumi clomps over to the group, ready to travel and fully outfitted.  The group lets him know they think there might be a plot to kill his father and that Kurts boyfriend might be involved.

Having no idea, Buumi seems a little confused.

Patches heads off to find Val and let him know that they suspect Thessalt while Gundren does the same with **Sera**, Buumi's mother.  Both react cautiously but say they will keep an eye on him for any strange behavior.

As Patches moves off, she looks out of a window and spots Val moving toward the older children in the gardens for a sparring lesson (Emma sits with a bow across her lap), while across the way the younger children are being cared for by a servant.  She spots **Cercei** and Shon a little ways away.  The little girl appears to be berating the older man who hangs his head in apparent shame. She is wearing a flowing red dress with an elaborate red bow tied at her waist.

Finally finished with the teleport ring, Fey activates in and the group steps in, being whisked away to the Citadel of Helm's Hold.

**Helm's Hold**

**​**

The group finds themselves atop a massive tower, the teleport chamber of The Hold some 400ft up on a platform.

Looking around, the group sees armored paladins, clerics and three massive golden Golems standing guard, the flood plains of the coast extending out before them to the east, the city of Neverwinter just visible on the horizon to the north, a forest to the south and the coast and sea to the west.

The cleric steps forward and welcomes the group to The Hold.  She leads them to an archway and a set of stairs that spirals down the outside of the massive white, stone tower, the citadel ringing the structure far below in tiered concentric rings of fortifications and buildings.

Approaching a door, it opens and the group steps inside a mechanical elevator that ferries them down to the ground floor of the Cathedral.

A good twenty seconds goes by before the elevator makes it to the ground floor, never stopping.

The wooden door swings open before them and they see a truly massive stone chamber, the ceiling 90ft overhead and covered in paintings depicting celestials protecting innocents.  The white marble floor gleams with colors reflected through hundreds of stained glass windows and the place smells of incense and wildflowers.  Ahead, a massive stream of water falls from overhead into a massive platinum lined pool, seemingly endless but not overflowing.  This building is easily 160,000 square feet.

They step off the elevator and into the massive chamber and note a huge man in gold trimmed plate armor approaching them.  With dark skin, amber eyes, short curling hair and a pointed goatee the man looks stern and serious and in his mid thirties.  He introduces himself as **Javen Tarkimos**, Leader of the **Watchers of Helm**. 

Javen turns and leads them into the chamber, talking all the while.  He questions Buumi's intent, mentioning that The Trials of the Crusader have not been done in over 2 centuries and that the records of the trials were so incomplete that they had to get an old dragon who witnessed the last one to come in and help.  Javen wonders if the trials are not just Buumi trying to increase his celebrity status.

The group jumps in to defend the character of their comrade and Buumi himself says he has no idea why he called for the Trials, but he feels it was Helm calling him to do it.

Javen stops, turning to study Buumi.  He cracks a smile and nods, satisfied with the response he got from his questions.  He claps Buumi on the shoulders and wishes him luck, mentioning that he has things to prepare for the council meeting tomorrow, but he will try and make it for The Trials. Javen turns and walks another twenty feet, leading the group up to the endlessly pouring waterfall and the platinum pool, the odd rose petal falling around it as it flows.

Standing by the pool is an odd looking Dwarf.  Javen introduces him as **Aurinax** and then takes his leave.

**Aurinax** turns, smiling to survey the group.  Shorter than Gundren and of indeterminate age, the Dwarf is dressed in robes of glittering gold and orange. A short cropped, metallic gold beard and mane of well kept hair frames a friendly face, the skin even glittering slightly.  Two sets of gold eyes, slit like cats-eyes, squint out at the party and in his hand is a staff of gold, of two twisting dragons wrapped around one another.

"Ah, good." He says.  "I've been expecting you...".
