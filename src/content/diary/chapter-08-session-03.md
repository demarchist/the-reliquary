**Hulk Smash**

Three massive forms rush into the lightless cavern from their newly made tunnel.

Several of the group recognize them: Umber Hulks.  These hulks though are massive, bigger than any other specimen they have seen and adorned with long, chitinous horns atop their heads.

Fey turns from his potentially infected companions and quickly casts a spell of Deep Slumber.  Two of the massive beasts resist, but the third stumbled and crashes to the floor, incapacitated.

Tark turns and out of the darkness rushes one of the Hulks.  Unaware of their powerful gaze, the monk looks into its glittering compound eyes and finds himself lost in them, stunned.

The hulk scoops up the monk in its jaws and turns to take its prey back to its nest...Just as it is about to leave the chamber, a blast of scintillating light and shape hits it, charming the creature and rendering it incapacitated.  Tark however is struck by it as well and incapacitated.

One of the other hulks rushes toward Gundren but quickly finds itself surrounded by the powerful group.  Between Patches, JmJm, Gundren and Cirrus, they seriously injure the monster in a matter of moments as it rushes the smaller creatures, thinking them easy prey.

Mr. Pickles rushes over to Tark and slaps the halfling monk awake.  Tark quickly extracts himself from the mandibles of the creature and goes to join the fray.  He lays into the Hulk attacking his friends and reaches into it with his Ki.  

Tearing information from its spirit, Tark realizes how incredibly tough these creatures are, and that his Extract Aspect ability might cause spiritual damage to those it is used against.

The slumbering Hulk stirs and picks itself up off the ground just as the one battling the group is pushed back by a volley of Eldritch blasts.

Seeing an opening, the Hulk rushes forward to crush cirrus against the wall...only to slam head first into a block of solid ice the warlock summoned to protect himself.

Seeing The Deep Slumber has failed, Fey changes tactics and polymorphs one of the Hulks into a Myconid Sprout.  The massive 8 ft beetle-like creature suddenly shrinks into a 2ft bipedal mushroom...

The group focus fires the only Hulk currently awake/attacking and make short work of it; Patches rushing in and managing to jam Eclipse in it's neck armor, severing its head from its shoulders.

Cirrus sees in the block of ice that the polymorphed Hulk continues to try and attack the group.  Indeed, he sees it repeatedly nudge and bump into Patches, bruising her slightly. 

As the ice tomb vanishes, the little Myconid tries to run into Cirrus, bumping him and falling to the ground.  Having had quite enough, the warlock picks up the small thing, opens his bag of devouring and places it inside...feeding the vast creature on the other end of the sinister bag...

With only a single Umber hulk still alive, Doc B knocks it out of its incapacitated state.  It charges the little gnome and smashes Doc into the wall, hurting him badly.

The less than intelligent creature though is quickly surrounded.

Unfurling his bag of swords, JmJm calls upon his magical brooch and the ten swords leap to life and fly in at the hulk, slashing.

Already surrounded by the powerful group and now assaulted by a storm of blades, the final hulk is ripped apart in short order.

Patches spins on the group and begins to berate them for breaking one of her rules.

The others explain that the fungal corpse must have infected Gundren and JmJm and they're trying to fix it. 

Incredulous, Patches asks if they touched the corpse...thus breaking another rule...

turns out, they did touch the corpse.

Sighing in frustration, Patches watches as Gundren takes out a small hammer to crush a diamond.  Cirrus then takes the diamond dust and sprinkles it over the Dwarf, casting greater restoration.

Doc B meanwhile places his little paws on JmJm's eyes and a spray of spring water erupts from them, leaving behind two leaves over his eyes that then flutter off as butterflies.  JmJm is healed.

They try to make sense of the spores and the fungus it came from, but get little; other than it is not a natural native of the Underdark...

Fully recovered from the fungal spores, they turn their attention to the massive Hulks that just attacked them.

Investigating, Patches, Fey and Doc notice that under the carapace, there are dozens of massive tumors. These were not healthy creatures. 

Patches has never seen anything like this on the hulks, nor heard of any mind altering spores that would erupt from a body like they found...

They manage to harvest a fair amount of un-damaged carapace and hide from between the three Hulk corpses and they stash it away in a bag of holding.

Patches thinks that they most likely have until morning before anything comes to investigate the smell of the corpses and Cirrus creates his Tiny Hut - a perfectly black hemisphere of opaque force.

Cirrus waltzes inside and begins to get comfortable.

Patches takes one more quick look around the area, placing trip wires as Fey places the Alarm spell around one of the tunnels.

Satisfied, everyone retires into the warmth of the Tiny hut.

With thousands of tonnes of rock overhead, in absolute darkness and eerie silence the group begins to talk.  Worried about their trip into the Underdark, Tark asks why they are going to Menzoberranzan.

Patches responds that her Son deserves a better life than to live there.

After a few minutes of talking, they all notice Cirrus gesticulating wildly, but in silence.  They question him.

He finally breaks, hissing out that the dome does not block noise from escaping...and they have just been chatting away...

The group immediately hushes, embarrassed and they continue on in whispers.  They break out the rations and eat a meal before bedding down for the night.

No one rests easily. 

Doc B, JmJm, Gundren and Tark are all visited by nightmares and sleep fitfully.  They do not remember to subject of the dreams, only that they awake feeling uneasy.

Cirrus reports an uneventful night as Patches suspected and the dome fades shortly after everyone awakes.  They pack up their camp and continue on for the day.

**The Second Day of Travel**

**​****​**The group continues on in silence and darkness.

Hours stretch on uneventfully, Patches taking the lead, then swapping with Tark.

At one point JmJm goes on ahead, picking a path through a slippery tunnel so the group can easily follow.

Eventually though, the strangeness of the Underdark rears its head and the group is forced to stop.

Descending a tunnel, Patches reels back, her lungs suddenly burning.  Tark hauls back on her cape, pulling her from the invisible gas (in the darkness): Chlorine.

The group gathers just before the tunnel descends into the gas to come up with a plan.

Tark and Doc B are immune to the poisonous effects of the gas, the strange psionics of the Monk rendering him immune while Doc's control over nature lets him neutralize it even as he breathes it in.

They decide  to head into the gas with Gundren and JmJm wearing their gas masks taken from the assassins in Neverwinter.  They begin to scout the gas filled area.

After an hour, they finally return to the others waiting behind to let them know they have found a way through.

They spend the next hour and a half ferrying the group through the gas, taking two with the masks and then having the masks taken back to the other side.

Eventually, everyone is on the other side of the gas filled chambers and the group continues.

The group travels for many more hours in silence and darkness.  The smooth limestone deposits giving the world an oddly amorphous look.

The Upperdark is one of the more desolate environments, devoid of the great mushroom forests of the Underdark proper.

After several hours, the group once again halts to take stock of something up ahead.

The tunnels widen into a long thin cavern.  Up one wall, Patches spots the small abodes of Svirfneblin: Deep Gnomes.

The group moves in cautiously.  They spot a trap sprung long ago and note that the whole cavern has not been touched in some time.

No Svirfneblin can be seen and the presence of anything living is absent.

Despite Patches misgivings, Fey and Gundren move in to investigate the abodes.

They are dusty and devoid of anything of value.  The only sign that these were once inhabited comes when Gundren fishes a small bone from under a pile of refuse.  The bone of a Gnome.

Something happened here and either drove off the Gnomes, or killed them.  Either way, it happened weeks or months ago and the group presses on further.

After a few more hours, Doc is shaken from his thoughts by his rumbling tummy.  Thinking everyone could use a bit of a pick me up, he starts to keep an eye out for some food to scavenge.

Nothing shows itself for several hours of travel, until Doc's ears pick up a distant hissing and popping.

He calls to the others to wait and hops down a side tunnel, the group follows slowly and warily.

Doc comes around a bend and sees the source of the noise:  The tunnel is covered in small barnacle like creatures which Patches identifies as Bore-Limpets.  She also mentions they are quite delicious.

Avoiding the acid the small creatures seem to be secreting, Doc, JmJm and Patches go about gathering a large sack of the things, intent on boiling them up for a hearty meal when they next rest.

Seeing as the group has been traveling in this stressful environment for the last sixteen hours, the group decides to stop at the next decent camp site.

They find nothing for the next hour though and double back to a previous cubby that would hold the Tiny Hut spell.

They set up, cook their food and engage in quiet conversation.

Everyone settles in to sleep, with Cirrus and Patches taking watches to keep them safe in the alien environment.

Fey turns to his spellbooks and begins to read as best he can.  Eventually, he finds he has an easier time meditating and begins to go over spell equations with Theodemir instead.  After a couple of hours of working on a specific spell, Fey thinks they have finally worked it out and he learns the spell: Manipulate Mass.

Meanwhile, everyone sleeping again has terrible dreams. 

Tark awakes, sweating and feeling a wrongness permeating the area.  He remembers the last moments of his dreams, his nightmares: Massive coiling tentacles ripping him apart as two fanged maws tear at his body...
