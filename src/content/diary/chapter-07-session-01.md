**Planning and Expeditions**

**​**Megno looks up at Fey, smiling and asks his friend if he remembers much about ancient Netheril Empire.

Fey remarks that he does and Megno continues; the book talks about the Sanctum of Krasus - Krasus being the most powerful mage to have ever lived.

Most importantly though, the book details that it is close by, merely 50 miles away South East in the Nether Mountains, at a split mountain called Shatterpeak.

The mountain itself is a well known landmark, but according to the book, the only way to find the Sanctum is to pass through an archway of stone on the north slope.

Fey and Megno both quickly agree that they have to mount an expedition at once.

Heading downstairs, Megno gets Molly (his apprentice) to see to the groups needs.

Gundren is still working on Gwen.

Megno then rushes off to get permission from his Clan Head in the Explorers League, despite Fey's misgivings of spreading the information.

Fey rejoins the group in the Workshop and notes that Buumi is in the middle of showing off a new purchase - cooled Saddlebags for food storage.

Patches tries on her enchanted platinum mask, creating a Silent Image of herself and moving away…it takes Tark a while to notice.

Molly returns to her studies and the group continues telling one another of their respective adventures of the last few days.

Just as the group is discussing what to do next, a knock on the open front door of the workshop disrupts the group and they look up.

In the doorway is Forgefather Halfhand and a lady-dwarf named **Helga Stoneheart;** the Mason to be in charge of building the castle at the Barony.

The group goes over their wants for the construction, letting the dwarves know of the situation there with the Orcs.

Though a little annoyed, the Dwarves agree to work alongside the Orcs and offer up their ledger for a signature to begin construction.

As the group is deciding to get everything out in the open, Patches orders Mr. Pickles to lead the Dwarven miners/scouts back to the Barony, accompanied by Kitty and Aurora.

Mr. Pickles agrees and the Dwarves are quite taken aback at seeing a blue Goblin.

After some assurances, the Dwarves mutter a little but otherwise accept that it's just another client.

With a signed contract, the Dwarves pack up and leave, with Mr. Pickles and the cats heading out when the party leaves.

Shortly, Megno returns, locks his door, raises his wards and tells the party he's gotten permission to take an expedition to The Sanctum of Krasus.

Due to the sensitivity of the information, he's authorized to only hire the group and has to go himself.

He hands the group a check for 10,000 gp for supplies, promising another 10,000 upon confirmation of discovery of the Sanctum.

The group readily agrees and begins planning for the trip out into the snowy mountains.

**Shopping**

**​**Excited, Megno begins packing his own gear and making arrangements for transportation in the wintery wilderness.

The group decides to head out and pick up some supplies.

Patches veers off from the group to follow a lead on the Bank Heist; the Halfling spy.

Buumi stops by the Northern vault and "deposits" the **Artifact**

Tark picks up several healers kits.

The group heads to the Ward of Artifice and walk until they find a particularly good looking Alchemy store: Gilbert's Gumptions

Inside, they meet Gilbert Bubblegump an elderly, and very short Dwarven Alchemist.

The group looks around the store, picking up a number of different potions and haggling the price down a bit.

In exchange for a permanent 20% discount, the group agrees to give Gilbert first right of refusal on any rare potions recipes and reagents that they find.

Cirrus then remarks it's probably about time he gets some armor and everyone is flabbergasted he has not been wearing any.

Gilbert recommends his brothers store, Albert's Armor and the group heads out to the store.

Albert is the spitting image of his brother, Gilbert, though quite a bit taller and sporting a fancy Mithril waistcoat.

Cirrus finds a fantastic suit of enchanted leather and manages to get a significant discount by trading away plate armor and a few Grenades.

Meanwhile, Patches has found the Halfling spy and followed her to an inn in the residential quarter of the Undercity - The Short and Curlies.

Patches spies the Halfling inside, chatting with three other figures; a Gnome male, Half-Elf female and Human male.

Heading inside and sitting at the bar, Patches listens intently.

She discovers that the heist is going down at midnight with the Gnome mage; Frumple Binswaddle doing the actual infiltration.

The others will be covering him outside incase something goes wrong as he's apparently using potions to infiltrate.

The group of thieves breaks for the remainder of the day, going about their separate business until midnight.

The group returns to the Workshop and Gundren has finally finished fixing, and upgrading Gwen with Adamantite.

Impressed with his work, Gundren knows though, that any further improvements will require something more powerful than an Enchanted Gemstone to run.

He begins thinking about what he would need to construct a new core for Gwen.

Megno remarks that he's ready to go and the group all agree…except for Patches

Patches asks for some privacy and Megno leaves.

She then tells the group about the Heist and what she has learned and that she has orders to stop it from Lady Faye.

One and all, the group agrees that the heist of the Southern Vault cannot be allowed as it would encourage other thieves and pose issues for their own security.

The group decides to foil the heist.
  

**Foiling the Heist**

The group splits with Buumi, Gundren and Fey'Anon heading to a bar near the bank in the southern military district.

Cirrus transforms his owl familiar into a spider, complete with Cirrus-face-patterning and then meditates in the Workshop, looking through his familiars' eyes.

The spider is handed to Patches at first, but her absolute revulsion at spiders almost causes a panic attack and it is instead handed to Tark who will be accompanying her into the Bank.

Patches, Tark and Spider-Cirrus all head out and begin watching the vault, waiting for any sign of the would-be thieves.

Meanwhile, Fey is trying to read a book in a rambunctious Dwarven Bar with Buumi and Gundren engaging in heavy drinking, waiting to back up the others if need be.

It takes a while, but right around midnight, Patches notes the Halfling spy walking near the Vault entrance, but unlike earlier in the day, her belly is swollen and pregnant.

Right on cue, the Halfling stumbles and cries out in pain as she passes the Vault and two of the guards go to assist her and the others are caught by the momentary distraction.

The halfling is helped and she moves off.

Patches looks around but sees nothing else happening and realises that whatever just happened, it was what they were waiting for and mentions to Tark that the Gnome probably just went inside, invisible.

Tark calls upon his blindfold and peers through it with Truesight and sure enough, sees a floating Gnome, shining with gold light drifting through the Bank entrance.

Tark points this out and they head into the bank, quickly trying to figure out a plan to stop the levitating invisible Gnome.

They look around and see many guards, patrons and workers, but no one seems to be noticing the invisible Gnome.

Tark anxiously remarks that the Gnome is about to pass by the Guards to the Vault itself and is rapidly approaching the open tunnel.

Thinking quickly, Patches pulls a card from her deck of illusions, but second guesses herself.  Until Tark says the Gnome is IN the tunnel and she throws the card!

The card spins down into the center of the vault and both Tark and Her turn and casually walk away the moment the Card is in flight.  It touches down and immediately a Night Hag appears, cackling and appearing very threatening.

The Bank goes into a frenzy, with Patrons yelling and backing away and guards all coming to the ready, lowering halberds in a clatter of plate armor. The front door closes with a resounding boom.

The guard nearest the Vault tunnel turns and slaps a hand onto the wall, depressing a previously invisible section and in the tunnel, the entire roof drops.

As several thousand pounds of stone seal off the Vault tunnel, poor Frumple is obliterated in a spray of gore that jettisons out into the bank, spraying guards and patrons.

Tark and Patches look on wide-eyed and dumbfounded from their places in the panicking crowd.

A younger Dwarf woman, in gold robes and ruby spectacles (identical to Goldhold's) rushes forward and scoops up the card, dismissing the illusion and calling out, letting everyone know it was not a real monster.

Guards and Bank officials, including the Gold robed woman, crowd around the collapsed tunnel (and blood gout) and try to figure out what just happened. 

Patches hangs back, but Tark goes up and begins asking the guards what happened, going so far as to ask one of them what he would steal if he was robbing the bank.

The surprised guard recognises the childlike curiosity and doesn't think much of the remarks but is definitely suspicious of the strange bearded halfling.

After about twenty minutes, the main doors open up again and patrons are allowed to leave.  The guards and bank officials believing the incident over.

Quite a crowd has gathered outside and the story of the event begins to spread quickly through the Undercity.

The group convenes at the Dwarven pub and Patches and Tark relay the story, which gets a round of laughs from everyone.

Meanwhile, his job done, Cirrus begins huffing Analgesic Grenade back at the workshop. 

After a quick discussion everyone decides to head to the Northern Vault and report the security issues the group has noticed, hoping that procedures will be updated (such as redundant Vault-keepers).

They speak with Goldhold and let him know of their suggestions and what they saw at the Southern Vault.

Goldhold laughs and remarks about the "Gusher" assuring the group their concerns will be addressed in due time.

Patches veers off to tell Lady Faye of their success and will meet up with the group back at Megno's place.

Patches finds a quiet spot and writes to her Lady with her special Quill, letting her know of the foiled plan.

Patches then heads back to The Short and Curlies where she expects the remaining thieves to have gathered to discuss the fallout and then scatter.

Patches enters the Inn and goes to the bar for a drink and sure enough, the three remaining thieves are sitting around the same table, talking intently and drinking mugs of ale.

Listening in, they toast their fallen comrade, but are at least a little re-assured that he was not captured and nothing can be traced to them.  They down their mugs and call for a second round.

Patches, by the bar, waits for the bartender to turn her back and then slips poison into each of the new Ale-mugs heading for the table.

The new round makes it to the thieves and they down their second round, imbibing the poison...

Fifteen minutes goes by and two of the three remark they are not feeling well and head up to their rooms to sleep it off.

The Half Elf feels the effects of the Ale, but more drunk than ill and heads back to her room to simply sleep.

Patches slips up the stairs, following her targets.  She notes the half-elf enter her room.

The rogue waits for fifteen minutes and then approaches the door and uses her thieves tools to open the lock.

Slipping into the room, Patches notes the half-elf passed out on the bed.  She re-locks the door and approaches the sleeping woman.

She then proceeds to stab her in the brain through her throat with the Luck Blade, killing her instantly.

Looking around the room, Patches finds little of interest but her investigation is interrupted by heavy knocks on the door and a man urgently asking to be let in.

The man, the human of the Thieving group calls out, saying he thinks he's been poisoned and needs the antidotes in the Half-Elf's room.

Patches, who had hidden herself on the inside corner by the door, opens the door and the man stumbles inside.  The door is instantly closed behind him.

Before the bleary, poisoned man can react to the sight of his companion dead in her bed, Patches steps up behind the man and slits his throat.

Patches then leaves the room, ensuring she has no blood on her and casually walks down the hallway to the stairs to the common room.

As she heads down the stairs, the proprietor is there, asking Patches if she heard someone calling out about poison?  Patches says she did not, pays her tab at the bar and then leaves...

The rest of the group meanwhile has returned to Megno's place and turn in for the night, ready to hit the road in the morning.  They do note a passed out and drooling Cirrus in the corner of the room.  Molly has at least put a blanket over him. 

Patches returns to the Workshop and settles in for the night.
 **​**

**On the Road again**

**​**The group is awoken by an excited Megno.

Buumi quickly whips up a meal of Eggs and Bacon as the group prepares to leave.

Megno leaves the workshop in Molly's hands and the group heads to the Uppercity.

After taking the elevator up, the party is greeted with a snowy and bustling Uppercity in a far better state than the last time they were in Sundabar.

Almost all the rubble is completely gone and half-rebuilt structures are everywhere.  Despite it being winter, construction is continuing through the season.

The group heads out of the city, exiting through the East-Gate and finding a small cluster of inns and stables just outside.

Waiting for them is a large covered sleigh pulled by two Moose.

Megno approaches the stable-hand currently watching over the strange vehicle and pays him for the rental.

After a brief exchange, the Sleigh is handed over and the group loads on their supplies and then clamber on themselves.

The sled is the size of a large covered wagon, easily large enough for eight people and supplies, the sides and covering of the sleigh appearing to be made of thin sheet metal riveted onto a wooden frame and then insulated. 

The aerodynamic silhouette coupled with the massive curving sleds, pulled by two Moose is more than a little eye-catching. 

With everything ready to go, Megno takes the reins and with Tark sitting atop the sled in his cold weather gear, grinning like an idiot, the sled takes off due east.

Heading towards the Nether Valley and the mountain range, snowy rolling fields spread out ahead of them.

It's quick and easy going for the first day as trees are sparse and there are many (snow covered) roads, which the Moose and sled have no trouble with.

During the days travel, the group spots a herd of wild pigs snuffling around in the snow.  They're startled by the sled, but quickly go back to their own business - which includes frolicking in the snow after a wheel of cheese that Tark hurls into the snowfield.

As the sun begins to set and the cold weather really starts to bite, Trees have started to become more regular and the beginnings of a forest slows the progress considerably.

The group decides to set up camp for the night.

Staying up and enjoying the brisk winter night, the group looks at the stars, enjoying the moonlight for a bit, chatting.

Buumi asks a bit more about Cirrus' past and what it was like growing up in Amn, taken in by a stranger and raised by tieflings.

The group then asks about Buumi and his long dead cousin, the little girl he accidentally killed.  He says that he hopes that he might one day find a way to un-do it, or find the power to save another in a similar situation.

The conversation turns to Cercei and he admits that he would love to "save" her from becoming evil like all the other Chromatic dragons.

Fey suggests that such a thing would be blocking a goddess from one of her own and extremely hard to do, but everyone agrees that in this crazy world, anything is possible.

The group settles in for the night, taking the watch in shifts, though Cirrus stays up the entire night not needing sleep.

Fey stays up first, studying the spellbooks he's acquired and seeing what spells he can glean.  In a flash of insight, some of the knowledge from Theodemir unpacks in his mind and he jots down the beginnings of a new spell centered on manipulating time and space.

At one point Cirrus and Fey are made aware of a figure off in the snow.  Sending out his Owl, Cirrus spies an Orcish hunter pursuing deer tracks and the conversation back in camp turns to the Orc and it's potential comrades.

The morning comes with no further development and as the group slowly rouses, Buumi pulls out the Cast Iron and begins a breakfast of more eggs and bacon!

Everyone is made aware of the Orcish hunter and it's decided that the Owl should be sent out to scout a little bit as they continue their trek on the sled.

Tark and Megno begin warming up the Moose, taking their leads and walking them around, rubbing their muscles and ensuring they have plenty of feed.

Tark grabs the feedback and tries to use it as motivation to get the Moose moving, but in a few massive strides, the beast stands over Tark and sticks its head into the bag, lifting Tark off the ground as he holds onto it.

The Moose now warmed up and everyone being well fed, they clean up the campsite, board the sled and head off into the thickening trees of the Nether Valley.

Ahead, through the still sparse trees, the Nether mountains are clearly visible, and one peak in particular catches everyones eye - A mountain split in half as if by a sword stroke, the edges weathered and crumbled but the cut still easily discernible as unnatural.

With the owl flying as scout and Cirrus meditating, seeing through its eyes, the group gets ample warning of the signs of a settlement ahead.

By a large ice-less lake, with warm steam rising from its banks, Cirrus sees the forms of dozens of huts and yurts as well as the tiny specks of their inhabitants.

Cirrus lets the group know and a brief discussion ends with  the group deciding to blow on by, but meet any threat with a show of overwhelming force.

Gunren pops the top hatch of the sled to use as a turret, with Gwen up there beside him and Patches at the back of the Sled with her Crossbow.

As they near, Patches pulls out her Spyglass and begins scouring the woods looking for any Orcish scouting parties.

As the Sleigh speeds through the forest, Patches pans her view and for a split second, catches sight of a very confused and surprised Wood Elf out snow-shoeing.

Not stopping, the group makes it from the treeline and speeds along the border of the Lake, clearly smelling the hot springs and mineral pools and seeing across the water a Village.

Now closer, they can see that the village appears to be a tribe of Orcs co-habitating with a tribe of Barbarians.

Just in case the village gets any ideas, Cirrus casts an illusion spell, making the Moose appear to be aflame.  Thus starting the legend of the Flaming-Moose Sleigh of Winter.

A few of the villagers can be seen coming to the waters edge to look, but none gather in any large crowds and the Owl reports that no war-parties are being gathered.

Making it around the hotspring fed lake, the group is now coming up to the foothills around Shatterpeak.

**The Giants and the Gnolls**

**​**The sleigh bursts from the tree line and out onto a flat snowy expanse beneath Shatterpeak onto a frozen lake.

Vast and flat, the group can easily see their destination rising before them.

However, something catches their attention some way across the lake.

Four Frost Giants, massive and blue-skinned are running across the lake, a huge furry mammoth by their side.

The lead Giant appears to be female, and as Patches raises her spyglass, sees that a baby mammoth is clutched in her arms.

Nipping…literally…at their heels is a huge pack of Gnolls twenty strong.

The Gnolls catch up to the trailing Giant, an older silver-bearded behemoth, and his mammoth companion and begin to throw spears and shoot bows into their backs.

The group knows when to pitch in, and the sleigh speeds across the flat, snow covered lake, quickly gaining ground.

Patches and Gundren take up firing positions atop the Sleigh and the moment they're within range, begin firing off shots at the trailing Gnolls, downing a few with each volley.

A lance of popping fire jets out from Fey'Anon at the front of the sleigh, blasting the Gnoll fodder away in a shower of bones and debris.

Moments later, the group spots another Gnoll pack crossing across the ice, trying to flank the fleeing giants and Fey alters his second fireball to detonate on the new pack.

The old giant and his Mammoth turn to fight, sliding to a stop on the thick ice, throwing up a shower of snow and the Gnoll pack slams into them, stabbing with spears and swords.

The Sleigh is brought to a halt and the group disembarks - Though Tark literally runs and leaps from the sleigh, directly into the pack of gnolls at the feet of the Giant.

The party fans out, defending the Sleigh as the back of the Pack turns and rushes them and the new pack splits, attacking the mammoth and party simultaneously.

Weakened by fireballs, Thundercannon shots and crossbow bolts, many of the Gnolls fall quickly, but their spears and swords cut deep into Gundren who is caught too far forward.

Tark defends the giant as best he can, downing Gnoll after Gnoll, but the Pack-leader recognizes the skill of his foe and proves to be ferocious, cutting into Tark with a black, notched blade.

At the front of the new pack, and directly in front of Gundren, a massive beastial Gnoll with red glowing eyes dashes forward.  The demonic Gnoll tears into the group with no regard for its own safety.

That is, until a burst of Synaptic Static splits the air, killing a half dozen Gnolls where they stand and staggering the remainder.

 Patches rushes up behind the Gnolls, fan-firing her revolver into the undead Gnoll Witherlings and then diving in with her blades.

The surviving Gnolls are still fighting the Giant.  The old behemoth smashes down with his club, while the Mammoth uses its tusks and Tarks continues his furious assault.

The Pack leader is flanked by Patches as the last of its minions die and between her and Tark, make short work of the Pack leader.

The fight by the sleigh is resolved shortly after, with spells, strikes and shots coming from the group in an overwhelming flurry, destroying the demonic Gnoll.

As the group, the Giant and the Mammoth catch their collective breath, the Giant eyes the group suspiciously as the old Mammoth walks over to its master.

Bleeding heavily, the Giant addresses the group and sounds like a rolling boulder, low and gravelly. He asks "What now?"

As the group gathers around, healing Gundrens wounds and assisting Tark, Cirrus steps forward and heals the large giant a little, just as Buumi does the same.

This puts the Jotun at ease a little.

Across the ice, the other giants have stopped and turned, beginning to head back across the ice as the Older Jotun waves his kin over…
