**The Aftermath**

**​ **Doc B. and the Leanansidhe step from a solid stone wall in a natural cavern tunnel.

The tunnel curves down into the Underdark on the left, and up to a larger chamber on the right, a soft orange glow lighting the tunnel dimly.

Lea leans down and pins a holly leaf to Doc B's coat and tells the druid to prick his finger and call her name three times if he needs to speak to her. 

The winter noble then vanishes, seemingly dispersed by an unseen wind.

Doc B wails after her that he only remembers her nickname!

Back in the main chamber, the group is still recovering from battling against the Devils.  

The clerics and Paladins of helm, along with Buumi, Cirrus and JmJm begin using spells to heal people.

JmJm looks around with his wildmagic gifted truesight and sees the cracks in the planes still, despite the Faerzress crystal being destroyed.

Patches and Tark hear a familiar wailing coming across the desolate, sulfurous arena and head over to investigate. 

Cirrus sends his spider familiar with Tark, but the thing is knocked away as Patches passes, her distaste for spiders evident.

Tark and Patches make it to the far tunnel and stealthily look down.  There they see an old friend, a small humanoid cat with a leaf-"scale" coat, a scimitar and a wooden walking stick, his Gnome Hat standing tall.  Doc B.

Tark steps out of hiding and calls down, rushing to the small catman and hugging him.  Patches steps out a few moments later and greets Doc with a nod and "how have you been?"

The three make their way back to the group, walking along the ancient stone seating of the arena. 

As they approach, the group enthusiastically greets Doc B, asking where he had been and what he had been up to.  There is some suspicion though.

Doc replies that he was taken by Demetrius in the Bog to be trained by the Fae.  He's back now having been brought by Lea.

Patches recognizes the name and sighs, figuring that the Fae that was once trapped in her weapon would show up again to meddle.

Cirrus and Fay question the coincidence of Doc B showing up there and warn the group that it could be a trick.

JmJm replies that he does not recognize the little gnome (and he sees a gnome, not a cat!) before him, though it smells like Doc.

Tark activates his blindfold and with its limited Truesight, he too sees not a cat, but a Gnome, and is shocked.  All his insight tells him that its still Doc, so he listens to his gut.

Cirrus yells, asking why no one is more concerned about the army of Devils that just invaded but gets mostly blank looks and shrugs back.  Fey looks at him and nods, they will investigate.

Cirrus accepts this, thinking over his strange connection to the devils, wondering how he simply knew their language...

The group heads to the elevator, deciding to head back to the Bumidere estate to rest and look over the Amnians.

They get the clerics and paladins to promise to protect the arena as best they can and Amarandine says she will hallow the area to drive away and lingering darkness.

As they go, JmJm has Amarandine, the halfling Cleric prepare the body of the dead paladin for reincarnation the next day.

Ascending the elevator, the group is surprised to see Anaxtrasa leaning against the wall on the floor above.  She asks what the commotion downstairs was and gets the summary.

Shocked, Ana steps onto the lift to go and investigate herself. 

JmJm sees the image of the Blue Dragon behind the elf form with his truesight.  He still decides that winking is a good idea.  

She winks back as the elevator begins to descend and the group heads back up through the catacombs.

The group makes it back to the main cathedral of Helm, chatting with Doc and filling him in as best they can (there's a lot).

Arriving at the main chapel, the group ascend the tower to the teleportation circle and the Watcher there activates it, sending the group twenty miles to Neverwinter City.
  

**The Bumidere Estate**

Back in the city, the group heads straight for the estate and the gates are opened wide despite the late hour, the guards recognizing everyone.

**​**Doc B is really impressed by the huge manor, but likes the gardens far more.

Arriving at the mansion they head inside to rest up after the massive fight.

Val asks Patches who the little cat is and she says he's with them and named Doc B. 

Val raises an eyebrow and accepts it with a small huff.

Sera at this point comes in from a side room and asks Val where Georg and Marta are as she has not seen them in two days.

Val says they are taking some time away from the children in the guest house.

Everyone heads to bed, Doc B going with Tark and Buumi.  

JmJm heads to the rooms he's told are for the Amnians, with Fey in stealthy pursuit.

cautious and wondering about JmJm's allegiances, Fey follows the bard back to his rooms and waits outside.

An hour later, Fey walks into the room, assured the Bard is asleep.

Looking around, Fey sees two beds.  One has the ungracefully lumped, sleeping JmJm. 

The other bed with two figures, a human woman and seemingly human man sleeping.

The woman is staring right at Fey as he enters the room.

She shoots Fey a questioning look and Fey just shrugs, walking over to the unconscious JmJm.

Pulling out his spellbook, Fey begins preparing a Geas.

The woman, Chani, rushes silently from her bed and goes to grab Fey's hand.  

They lock eyes for a moment, and the woman drops incapacitated, unconscious in moments.

Fey continues.

And casts a Geas upon JmJm not to harm the group in any way.

The wizard then leaves to take his reverie.

Meanwhile, Patches has been skulking.

Hearing Cirrus praying LOUDLY and singing terribly, Patches uses the racket as cover to pay a visit to Thessalt/Holst.

Finding the halflings room, she sneaks up and begins to pick the lock.  A tumbler clicks loudly and she hears snoring within the room.

She finishes unlocking the door and the click wakes Thessalt.  Patches hears a "huh?" from within the room and hears footsteps approaching the closed door within the room.

Patches waits, ready to kick the door into Thessalt/Holsts face...but nothing happens and she hears nothing on the other side of the door.

She opens the door quickly and slinks inside, throwing out a card from her deck of illusions; a duplicate of herself.

She sees an empty room.  She feels the bed, its still warm.  Looking around though, she sees absolutely nothing, but feels like she's being watched...

Patches slinks from the room, flipping off the unseen Thessalt. Re-locks and then breaks the lock of the door, and strings a tripwire across his door for good measure.

Patches then heads to her room to meditate and think about the evening.

That evening, the group rests.

Tark awakes in the early hours of the morning, cold and shivering, his breath coming out in plumes.

He sees the fire out, Doc B curled up in front of the coals and Buumi asleep in bed.

Tark climbs off the couch and looks around, seeing light coming in under the door from the hall.

Heading over, Tark opens the door, to a dark hallway.

Standing some 20ft away is a young halfling man that looks strikingly familiar, though his throat is cut.  The pale face looking at Tark in sadness.

The Monk sees a red ribbon clutched in the man's hand, the man who he now recognizes as his father.

Tarks father raises a trembling hand and points behind his son.

Tark spins and directly behind him is the Oni; Li Xian.  The Oni grabs the little monk by the throat as the world erupts and is engulfed in fire.

"To not repeat the error's of history" Tark hears Mr. Shon's voice as he is jolted awake, covered in sweat.

Looking around the room, he sees the fire burning softly, contained within the warded fireplace and Doc B is curled in front of it.  Buumi lies in bed snoring softly.

Tark wraps himself in his blanket and heads out into the warm, candle lit halls of the manor house.

Finding a servant late at night, Tark is directed to Mr. Shon's office.

He wanders down to the ground floor, hearing Cirrus still singing away and heads next door to the office.

Tark looks through the keyhole, into darkness and shadowsteps into the empty room.

Looking around the office, Tark sees the place immaculately tidy.  A Wardrobe and bookshelf in one corner and a simple desk with a leather chair.

Tark looks over the place but sees nothing out of the ordinary, sighing, he shadowsteps from the room and heads back to bed, disturbed by his dream.

The next morning, Doc B wakes up early and heads down to the dining hall.

Seeing the servants already beginning to put out a breakfast spread, Doc B takes out a small bejeweled bowl and begins casting a spell.

Throwing the liquid from the bowl, the whole thing exploding into motes of diamond dust, the table is filled with a Heroes Feast.

The servants gasp and the amazing smells of the feast begin to permeate.

One by one, this drags each person in the house out of bed and to the dining hall for the magnificent food.

JmJm awakes and sees a snoring Chani by the side of his bed.  

He gets out, picks her up and puts her into the bed and begins to get into the bed with her until he hears Gneiss clear his throat and threaten "Not again Whistler!".  (writing this down, too creepy!)

Seeing the serious expression on the big man's face, JmJm sheepishly leaves the bed and follows his nose to breakfast.

Patches swings by Val's office on the way down and asks if he's seen Thessalt today.

Val says he saw the Halfling leave earlier that morning.

Patches tells him what happened the night before which concerns Val.  

She asks him to lie to Thessalt, telling him the "Drow" is trying to kill him to put him on edge and keep him in the guard room if he comes back.  Val agrees.

By this time, everyone is fully partaking in the feast, eating and talking.  

Eventually even the children and the Amnians begin to make their way down.

When they do, Patches sees an opportunity and leaves the dining hall through the ballroom, circling back upstairs to go and investigate the Amnians rooms.

Meanwhile at breakfast, the children all file in and begin grabbing plates to help themselves.  JmJm stares, noting something odd.

Upstairs, Patches walks into Abdul and Leigham's shared room as a servant makes the bead.  Looking around she sees Abdul has a ton of traveling bags, though Leigham has a single chest.

The two halves of the room are split by a divider.  A fully stocked and full decanter of alcohol rests in a cabinet between the two sections along the wall, untouched.

Patches says she is "lost" to the maid and leaves once she's been pointed to her own room.  

Instead she heads for the other guest suite; S'Olaa's room.

Picking the lock and heading inside, she sees a lavish suite, already cleaned for the day.  She notes a single chest at the foot of the bed and a bottle of wine and a single glass (unused) on the nightstand.

Approaching the trunk, she sees a gemstone on the front, embedded into the wood and surrounded by gold filigree. She touches it.

Nothing happens and its luster is not stolen.  It is magical.  A moment later, the clear diamond gem clouds with red, then blue, then yellow.

The gemstone appears to change colors every 10 seconds. A lock?

Patches looks around and then leaves, re locking the door and heading downstairs, unwilling to further risk an alarm spell or the like.  

In the hall she sees Mr. Shon waiting and reading a small book, not entering the dining room as the children eat their breakfast.

The Amnians leave the breakfast hall, Abdul talking with the wizard Leigham and S'Olaa while Gneiss (Earth Genasi Warrior) and Chani (human monk) wait nearby, attentive and alert.

A waiter brings up some food and S'Olaa declines the alcohol but drinks some fruit juice.  

Abdul takes nothing from the tray but takes something from a pouch on his hib and begins to chew it. Tobacco?

Breakfast is fast consumed and the group feels invigorated.  

The servants resupply the breakfast and the rest of the Bumidere family rotates through, eating heartily before beginning their daily activities.

The group prepares, as do the Amnians, to head to Helm's Hold for the Council.

It is currently 10 a.m, the meeting begins at 1 p.m.
