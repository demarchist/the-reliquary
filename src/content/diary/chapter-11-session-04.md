The group decide to head back through the Ringed Veil, to the turquoise coast and the ramshackle village there.

Buumi grabs the corpse with the runes carved into it, intent on questioning Hazzim about it.

They head back through the veil and on the other side, begin to set a camp and rest.

The Duergar stay in their own small camp while the group prepares a Magnificent mansion.

Buumi gets nothing from the corpse other than it was engraved with symbols of necromancy for an unknown purpose.

Over the course of the evening, several of the group are on watch and it is uneventful.

That is until Cirrus is on watch and while chatting with the Duergar, is ambushed by ghouls that had crept from the Ringed Veil.

The group is quickly roused and the battle is swift.

The Ghouls are destroyed, though not before several vomit disgusting and corrupting juices over several party members.

The rest of the evening is uneventful and in the morning, the main group heads out, back to the Mine, leaving the Duergar (except Veygar and Velka), Bowie, Maloo, and Merrigold behind.

As they head back into the mines,  the press of thousands of tonnes of rock replacing the beautiful open skies of the previous area, Velka and Veygar head off on their own to scout the vents of the Mines.

This leaves the group to themselves and they head back to the room with the Gemstone infusion tables and the four, large serpentine statues with gemstone eyes.

The group thoroughly investigates the area, discovering crates of Sourcestones ready to be infused with magic.

Buumi tries to infuse one and Divine power pulses into the stone.

Others try their own spells without luck, proving Buumi’s effort to be more of a fluke than the norm.

Even so, the group teleports the crates of crystals back to their bank.

They move on to the statues and the crystal eyes.

Using an unseen servant and a crowbar, Feanon attempts to remove the eye crystals, but each time a flash of magic destroys the Unseen servant.

Not wanting to tangle with a potentially powerful trap, the group decides to move on, further into the mine.

They come into a small storage chamber and discover a satchel of herbs for poison making as well as a parchment with symbols of the gods, one of which is obscured and unfinished.

As the group looks over this area, they are rushed by three Cultists and Buumi moves to intercept with Patches.

They are killed quickly, but are far tougher than expected, even attacking with tentacles and other strange magical attacks.

Moving in from where the attack came from, the group discovers a massive chamber with a pyramid in the center.

Deciding not to approach the pyramid yet (though Hazzim confirms it leads to the Mural they are looking for of the Last Word Fragment), they head down a side tunnel and spot more corrupted ooze and blackened webs.

These are different than the others though and are wreathed in purple energies.

Gundren ignites his cannon with magical flame and shoots the barriers.

The purple magic vanishes and then moments later, the large serpentine statues from the other room teleport besides the group.

Their eyes flash with magic and the sentries unleash a barrage of spells from their enchanted eyes.

The statues are tough and powerful and the group is caught by surprise.

Cirrus attempts to banish them several times, but the magically resistant sentries prove difficult.

Cirrus manages on the second attempt and manages to remove two from the battle temporarily.

With only two targets to deal with now, the group makes quick work of the sentries, then turn to where the others will appear and prepare to destroy them when they return from their banishment.

The banishment ends and the remaining two sentries are destroyed.

Tired from such a magically exhausting fight, the group moves into the large pyramid, intent on closing the pyramids grand doors behind them for security.

On the inside of the Pyramid, they see an open chamber with a raised dais in the middle.

A control panel is at the foot of the dauis and two small staircases lead up to the platforms top.

In the center of the platform is a metal plate of decoration and at the center of that, is a 10ft hole that descends into the unknown depths of the Underdark…

The group shuts the door behind them and sets up a watch on the hold, taking a short rest.

Buumi cooks for the group as they do this and hands out tasty treats.

Cirrus sends his owl down the hole to scout it, but the owl is attacked and destroyed by a creature several hundred feet down.

As they rest, they hear a commotion outside the pyramid ending in a human screaming in death.

Some creature out in the tunnels claims another victim.

The group heads out after their rest and finds nothing but bloodstains.

They return to the site of the corrupted webs and break through them, finding a storage room with ancient alcoves.

Opening many of them, they find ancient knicknacks and a great deal of decay.

Two items stand out though, a potion and a cloak and the group takes them.

Heading deeper into the mines, the group figures out that they are looking for three “keys” or icons to place in the control panel in the main pyramid here.

The keys, Hazzim relays, were held and then secured by high ranking cultists and he thinks he has an idea where.

Up ahead, the groups spots several ancient longhouses - barracks to house slaves maybe?

They move in, uncontested and ransack the place, finding numerous modern nicknacks and confirming this place as a barracks for the cultists.

During the investigation, the group finds around 400 Durhams (40gp) worth of Al’Askarian currency.

The group moves past two storehouses, intent on other tunnels for now and the vast cavern that opens up further on.

Checking a side tunnel, the group finds more ooze and webs and determines that they can use the Cult pendants to get through some of the corruption.

Inside this side chamber, they find an ancient Saurian weapon still in working order - some kind of magical lance?

They regroup back at the longhouses, intent on the rest of the mines and what they may encounter deeper in this dungeon…
