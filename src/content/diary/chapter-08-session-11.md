**The Blood Ritual**

**​**The Kuo-Toa are slaughtering one another as both factions clash in the middle of the town.

As the smaller creatures are torn apart by the Whips and Monitors, blood begins to flow and turn the mud red.

The waters of the Darklake begin to churn and froth red with blood as something beneath the waves feeds.

Indeed, many of the smaller cultists begin to leap into the waters, chanting "LEEMOOGOOLEEMOOGOO...", dipping beneath the frothing surf and not coming back.

The large Froghemoth begins to wade toward the town and the smell of blood, through the churning waters, but stops and shudders as it turns its attention to something beneath the waves.

Around the Shrine of the Deep father, the battle rages intensely with Ploop charging his daughter Blopp and engaging her atop the Shrine.

Doc B waves his staff in the air, calling forth to nature and creating a massive area of twisting seaweed in the dock area, slowing down the cultists.

Tark finishes off the Kuo-Toa in front of him and turns, hearing a deep guttural chuckle and sees the massive Kuo-Toa burning from Doc B's Moonbeam.

The creature smiles and the grin splits it's head as the body erupts, tearing apart.

In its place stands a massive 14ft tall Demon with four arms, two ending in massive pincers, with thick fur, scales and a long crocodilian tail. A Glabrezu.

The creature reaches out its smaller arms and a wash of Arcane energy hits the monk, stunning him.

The great beast then moves to engage Patches, who had leapt over a Kuo-Toa to flank with Tark.

As it begins to battle Patches, a number of shells from Gundren slam into the beast, exploding.

Patches hurls a smoke bomb into the demons face and coughing, it asks "WHY ARE YOU HERE!?", Patches responds "To kill assholes like you" and then calls upon the magic of her weapon.

Patches disappears and re-appears rapidly, slashing four targets (including the demon) before reappearing next to it, blood dripping from Eclipse.

The demon lets out a pained roar...answered off above the darklake by the caws of Vrock demons flying in...

In the Southern section of the city, the Kuo-Toa are fighting side by side with Fey, Cirrus and JmJm, slaughtering the cultists.

One small Kuo-Toa approaches Cirrus and asks him who they are, and why they are here.

Cirrus looks at the creature incredulously and basically ignores it, turning his attention back to the fight.

The small creature ambles up to Ront and touches the Orc to get his attention, moments later, the two of them are chatting away in Orcish, Ronts eyes glazing over a little.

One of the massive Kuo-Toa the group met earlier, Gloog (Ploop's Son) lumbers over to Fey and Cirrus.

As it approaches, its form twists and ripples and then bursts, throwing gore across the area as another massive demon takes form. Another Glabrezu.

This massive demon reaches out with a word of power and Fey'Anon is slammed with the stunning word.

Seeing the threat, JmJm decides its time to get to the boat.  He casts greater invisibility on Cirrus and then books it into one of the nearby buildings to get up to the second story bridges.

Cirrus sees the massive Demon and decides he's having none of it and slams the creature with a volley of Eldritch blasts, throwing it thirty feet back and through one of the ramshackle dwellings.

It stands up and lets loose a massive roar...answered by the caws of Vrocks heading in from the darkness above.

Shuushar rushes into the center of town, avoiding the demons.  He sees Ront talking with a Kuo-Toa and approaches, the small creature turning to converse with Shuushar.

As they begin to talk, Shuushar shakes his head and the little creature reacts in astonishment, and then rips out of the flesh mask it was wearing.  The little Kuo-Toa revealed to be an Incubus demon.

Shuushar steps away from it just as the demon commands Ront to do its bidding, hitting Gundren with a volley of Eldritch blasts as the Dwarf tries to re-position to get eyes on the second Glabrezu.

Seeing the incubus though, Gundren switches targets and fires a volley into the demon, hurting it enough to cause it to flee into the mess of buildings, Ront following quickly behind.

Snorbul rushes past Gundren, swearing in Undercommon that he's done with this craziness and begins to head for the boat.

Cirrus darts out to Eldritch blast the southern Glabrezu, smashing it back again.

Frustrated at the invisible Warlock, the demon growls and dispels the magic, just in time for the three Vrock demons to dive in to attack the Warlock...

Up north at the Docks things seem dire.

The Froghemoth flails, the water around it crimson with its own blood and the group sees a massive tentacle wrap around the behemoth and pull it beneath the waters.

The three vrock flying in let out a cacophany of roars, to which Doc B responds with a spell of Confusion.

Two of the flying demons are addled and fly in circles, but the third descends toward the Altar of the Deep Father.

The Glabrezu near the altar stumbles and falls to one knee as the combined might of Patches and Tark take their toll, the monk hitting it repeatedly, silencing it and extracting information from its Ki.

As the Glabrezu falls, dying, it stares at Tark in confusion saying "No Mortal knows how to do that..." referring to the Monk's ability to extract information.

The great beast dies, which frees the monk and rogue to turn their attention to the Altar of the Deep father.

Tark leaps atop the splayed out, bloody Manta just in time to stop Ploop from killing his own daughter atop it.  In a flash of insight, Tark realizes what is happening; this whole conflict is a massive blood sacrifice and killing a target atop the altar right now would complete it.

Tark tries to reason with Ploop, but the Kuo-Toa is not convinced, forcing Tark to knock both he and his daughter out and then pull them from the altar.

Patches rushes over to Mr. Pickles as one of the Vrocks descends on the crafty Goblin but is stopped...

As she rushes forward, three monstrous tentacles erupt from the waters, slithering onto the land in search of prey.

Not wasting a moment, Patches quickly climbs a nearby building and then leaps atop the closest, stabbing the thing with her poisoned Luck Blade. 

The tentacle hisses and shrieks, retreating into the water quickly in a spray of water and blood.

Across the harbor, the small bat that was Hemeth (the Duergar merchant) tumbles over itself and he regains his humanoid form.

Now on his boat, he looks at the melee and carnage before changing his gaze to look for something.  Spotting it, he calls out to Patches "HEY! I NEED ME COAL!".

Seeing that everyone is busy battling demons, Hemeth sighs and hops off his boat, rushing toward the barrel of coal on the shoreline.

JmJm is rushing over the bridges and spots the Duergar begin to haul the massive barrel and leaps down to assist.

They begin to make good speed with it, even through the plant growth of sea weed, just as another tentacle erupts from the water near them...

Over by the altar, another tentacle slithers up and grasps a smaller cultist, crushing it and using its tusks and teeth that go the length of the tendril to pass the meat down and into the water.

Down south , Cirrus is surrounded by demons and each lets out a magically enhanced screech, puff of spores or rakes at him with talons.  Selune protects Cirrus from all of it.

Fey shakes off the Glabrezu's stunning word and sees his friend in trouble.  He calls on the power of his staff and a wall of encircling ice erupts to protect the Warlock and push the Vrock demons back.

As Fey looks over the demonic incursion, he feels the rising blood magic and the ritual being enacted here and he realizes what it is.  These demons are servants of Demogorgon and they are attempting to awaken something beneath the waves of the Darklake.  They have been preparing this spell for weeks and the conflict is most likely engineered to create as much bloodshed as possible.  The only thing to set it off now, is a sacrifice atop the altar itself...

Gundren sees the Glabrezu and pumps a number of shots into the creature, damaging it badly.  So badly in fact that it looks around at the battle and decides that flight is its best option.

The Glabrezu, Incubus and Ront all slink away into the mess of ramshackle structures, abandoning the battle.

The Vrock demons however, pushed back from the Warlock by the wall of ice, turn and see the Dwarf and his fiery cannon.

The Vrocks fly in to rush the Dwarf, surrounding him quickly.

One peels off, seeing that the Kuo-Toa and Shuushar have surrounded the Idol of the Sea Mother and begun to pray.  As it moves in to slaughter the helpless fish-men, it seems to hesitate and grow frustrated, the spell of sanctuary emanating from the meditating Kuo-Toa pushing it back.

Cirrus meanwhile Farsteps from the Ice wall and hides in a nearby building, darting out to pop off blasts but finds all the targets are gone.  Walking around the nearby building, he sees Gundren in a tight spot, the Dwarf being raked by claws, and blasts one of the Vrocks away, through a nearby building.

Between the two of them, they start seriously damaging the demons.

One of the Vrocks is smashed out of one of the buildings, near the Shrine to the Deep father, it sees that no sacrifice has happened upon the altar and decides to fix that with the one Vrock nearby.

Grabbing one of the last Kuo-Toa, the Vrock hauls it on the altar, only for Tark to shove it off and kick the demon in the face.

It stumbles back and grabs the Fish-man again and leaps into the air, soaring up sixty feet to drop the body and break it upon the altar.

Tark Shadowsteps into the sky with a flying kick, killing and launching the potential sacrifice out to the water.

From his vantage point, he sees JmJm and Hemeth hauling the barrel of coal away from the tentacles and launch the coal up onto the boat as Fey makes it magically lighter.

With the demons, tentacles and cultists being fast annihilated and the spell remaining unfinished...the remaining tentacles slither back into the water, the Blood Ritual's energy diminishing.

The surviving demons feel their moment slipping away and take flight, soaring up and out of sight into the darkness...

The  center of the town is in ruins with blood and viscera everywhere, but the ritual was not completed, the beast in the water still slumbers.

Gundren stomps off to go collect their treasure promised to him by Ploop while Cirrus spots something interesting in the building he took shelter in; more treasure chests.

Cirrus goes through them, realizing it to be tribute amassed by the cultists and calls over Patches to assist in gathering it up.

On the Duergar barge, the ship rumbles to life, belching smoke and JmJm leans against the railing, calling for everyone to hurry up.

The rest of the group gathers around the altar to the Deep Father though, adamant that they figure out what just happened.

Fey'Anon begins to blast the Altar apart and explains the ritual and what they just avoided; The creature beneath the waves still slumbers, the tentacles were summoned constructs as a part of the ritual to consume the town.

For confirmation, Doc B heads over to the bloody shoreline and spots a swarm of Quippers finishing stripping a corpse of flesh.  He asks the carnivorous fish about what lives in the depths here.  Being simple fish, they respond as best they can, that a great creature slumbers nearby, off the shore and that they avoid the area.

Doc heads back to the meeting and relays the information and also mentions to an approaching Shuushar that the Plant Growth, if maintained over the next eight hours, will cause all plants in a half mile radius to become prolific and enriched.  The Kuo-Toa thanks the druid.

The discussion on what to do next continues, with Tark wondering why on earth they would still take the lake after what they just saw.

Patches responds that even after what just happened, there's just as many dark and dangerous things in the tunnels, but the lake is a much more direct route to Gracksuluth.

The group decide that the extra time circumventing the Darklake coupled with the likely possibility of Drow Pursuit is worth risking the dangers of the Darklake

They head toward Hemeth's ship to discuss things with the Duergar merchant…
