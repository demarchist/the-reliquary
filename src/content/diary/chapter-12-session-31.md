The group takes a long rest, relaxing and shaping the tower to their wills.

That night, Feanon hears the whispers of Vecna, telling him there’s just one more spell in the book, what could it hurt to learn it?

The wizard gives in, takes the book out, but fails to decipher the complex spell.

He takes his reverie, frustrated and puts the book back in the Titanium box.

The next morning, the group decides what to do over breakfast.

They decide to summon the Sultan to the Tower now that it is cleansed.

Gundren heads down to speak to the nearby Tower Guard and before long, Sultan Bashir and his Grand Vizier (and four Royal Guard in very interesting grown metal armor) show up.

Gundren takes them into the tower and they meet with the group.

The group informs the Sultan that they cleansed this tower of the evil that was inhabiting it, including the source of the plague in the aquifer beneath.

Bashir is shocked, he had no idea the source of their plague was in here, and is grateful for the group’s work.

They tell him that Tark is now the controller of the tower.

Bashir foresees some issues with the local nobility and has the Grand Vizier bestow the title of Pasha on him so he can legally keep the tower.

Tark is confused but just kind of accepts it.

They they collect supplies for their trip to the Machina factory.

Bashir and the Grand Vizier take their leave.

Jareem returns to the group having met with his contacts.

He informed the Obsidian Order of the group’s work and effectiveness and hisis agents amongst have offered assistance against Vecna.

The group has Jareem inform his agents that they want scouting done through Thueba Swamp, specifically looking for an ancient Machina Factory.

He will relay the request.

The group then tells Jareem that he should stay here in the Golden Tower as its guardian while they take one of the smaller Ringed Veils to (what they hope is) Thueba Swamp.

He agrees to hold down the fort in Iyum, he has a lot he can orchestrate from here.

They then head to Kumuzu Isa’s old room and begin to work on the Ringed Veil with the mud tracks.

After a few hours, Gundren and Feanon between them feel quite confident in deciphering the technology for their current mission.

They reactivate the ring and connect it to its currently configured partner.

The gateway connects and Cirrus summons a powerful Celestial and sends it through the gate with orders to make the area safe and to communicate what it sees on the other side with a notepad.

The celestial goes through the portal and a few minutes later, Feanon recalls the notepad.

On it he sees beautiful drawings in red ink depicting a cult of the Black Skull encampment, now destroyed and slaughtered by the Celestial, its walls covered in gore.

The drawings are done in blood.

The Gate connects and the group heads through to the other side.

They are greeted with a grisly sight, over thirty cultists of various races have been killed.

The fortification is definitely safe.

The group looks from the windows of this place and realize that they are high up in the mountains, overlooking the Thueba Swamp.

The ruins are an ancient Arracokran eyrie, now repurposed by the cult.

They deactivate the Gateway and take steps to secure it and then exit the Eyrie, descending the cliff on newly hewn stairs.

The barren mountainside sweeps below them and they begin the long descent under the glaring twin suns of the place.

There is not a tree in sight to offer shade and the scorching heat begins to exhaust the group.

As they descend, they come across a massive Fire Giant, smashing the mountainside with craterous punches.

Tark approaches carefully and asks what the Giant is doing.

The surprisingly amicable creature tells him that he is looking for sacred metal of his people; Titanium.

Tark offers his spear to the giant and the creature is shocked that this halfling has a spear of holy metal.

He asks why Tark is here.

Tark responds that they are heading into the Swamp.

The giant refuses the spear, telling the Monk that he will need the weapon where he is going.

Tark takes his leave and returns to the group when it becomes clear the giant wants to be left alone.

The group continues their descent, finally reaching the edge of the swamp by late afternoon.

The group looks across the tangled expanse of Thueba Swamp, a tropical quagmire filled with gnarled trees and expansive vegetation.

Wisps of mist rise from the waters and the ground beneath the canopy quickly vanishes into darkness.

They are separated from it by 600ft of flowing water as the Great Canal empties into the swamp.

Across the water, the group spots a shipwreck being picked over by Griffons and other large predators and it piques their interest.

They decide to fly over and investigate.

As they get near though, a chorus of ghostly howls splits the air and the waters begin to churn.

A legion of undead begin to rise from the waters and the nearby wisps of cloud and moisture clinging to the swamp twist and move as ghostly giants float among the vapor.

The group stops up short, taken aback by the vast array of undead before them, unsure what to do next, attack? Or retreat?
