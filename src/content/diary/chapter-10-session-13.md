The group sits down in the shielded room and get the lay of the land from Dalfred.

A Bregan D’Aerthe Agent will arrive at midnight and escort the group through the city, to the old Do’Urden compound.

To facilitate this, the Halfling hands out papers for each of the crew.

The group then retires to their rooms and begin to hash out their plan.

As the group rests, Gundren is visited in his dreams.

Vizeron, the Drow Archmage sits with Gundren at a dinner and asks if the group is betraying him.

Gundren says that they’re not, they’re in Menzoberranzan to meet with Jarlaxle on business pertaining to the acquisition of the spell ingredients.

Vizeron seems to buy the explanation and has Gundren promise to hand over the Spell components to his apprentice **Grein **when he arrives.

Gundren agrees and the dream ends.

Waking up a few hours later, Gundren hears a knock on his room door.

Investigating and opening the door, he sees **Grein, **Vizeron’s apprentice.

Thinking quickly, Gundren gets the Apprentice to back off for a minute and wait for them downstairs.

The group quickly assembles and Gundren fills them in that Vizeron might be on to their betrayal soon if they dont hand over at least one ingredient.

The group settles on a plan and head down to Grein, informing him that the ingredients are in their bank and must be retrieved once they leave the City of Spiders.

Grein reluctantly agrees, though mentions that *they* know of the groups holdings in Sundabar and he will head there to retrieve the items.

Grein then leaves.

The group then sketches a pretty good approximation of Grein and sents it to **Goldhold **in Sundabar.

The old Dwarf responds that he’ll keep an eye out.

The group then heads into the back alley of the Narbondellyn’s shadow to meet their Bregan D’Aerthe contact; Krilelyn or “Nose”.

The drow approaches and they quickly see that he’s missing his nose, hence the nickname.

They head out into the city.

Traversing the various districts proves to go without much serious trouble, though they see many interesting and terrible sights  

A cultist sacrificed on an altar to Lolth 

gangs of ruffians and slaves 

patrols of packs of demons and their priestess masters 

parades of noble-born soldiers and their painted slaves.

Noble-born Drow Wizards drawn to the Arcane emanations of the group.

Arriving at the Westwall, Patches sees the old Do’Urden compound and notes the guard presence inside the derelict.

Krilelyn informs them that though shabby, the house defenses are fully operational and they will have to skirt the outer wall.

Crossing the open ground, they are wrapped in darkness by Tark and easily make it to a hidden tunnel.

Rising along the wall, the group eventually finds themselves looking out, over the Drow Compound and nestled among the stalactites of the ceiling.

Two figures appear, floating from around the stalactites and approach. One drow remains quiet and unobtrusive, the other is the polar opposite

One is very flamboyant for a Drow, doublet, leather pants, knee high boots, a widebrimmed hat with a feather and a sweeping rapier on his hip.  The bald Drow wearing all this also sports an eyepatch and a large grin.

Jarlaxle welcomes the group, happy to finally be meeting the folk he has heard so much about and for so long.

He drops enough details to prove that his spies have been to the Barony extensively.

He informs the group that he cannot leave the compound due to a promise and that the group should not step over the threshold or risk setting off an alarm.

Due to the infernal politicking of Drow Society, if the group is discovered, Jarlaxle would have no choice but to attack them and put on at least a very good show of it.

The group begins to talk and negotiate with Jarlaxle, laying out that they have a spell to deal with Demon Lords AND the ingredients for it.

In exchange for the spell being delivered to House Baenre, along with the ingredients, the First House of the City must extradite Finn, Patches Son.

Using a claim of parentage that Tiago Baenre is Finn’s father, Jarlaxle believes that it can work.

He agrees to the terms, taking the spell, but not taking the ingredients until Finn is safely delivered to the Barony, secreted away from the city after he is moved to house Baenre.

In short

The Drow Ruling houses will deal with the Demon Lords, summoning them and killing them with the spell and ingredients provided by the group

Gromph Baenre will cast the spell to fix the Underdark, giving great honor and prestige to house Baenre.

In exchange, the ruling house of the city will strongarm Patches family into giving up the kid, then Bregan D’Aerthe will take the kid to the Barony (pre-arranged with Baenre).

The group is pretty sure that someone is going to double cross them and expect Finn to have some kind of programming or charm upon being remanded to the surface.

They will be ready.

Finishing negotiations with Jarlaxle, the group descends the wall of the city cavern and head out from the Do’Urden Compound, back into the City of Spiders.
