**The Attack Ctd.**

Fey sees the house quickly disintegrating and notes a number of enemies in the gardens.  Unwilling to stay in a deathtrap of a building, the flying wizard (with Mirror image enacted) flies out of the back door and out into the stormy night, launching a firebolt at the enemy archer he spots out back.

​The assassin in the ballroom sees that he is vastly outnumbered and disengages backwards, out into the gardens and dives behind a nearby tree, rushing just behind the flying wizard.

Meanwhile in the foyer, Li Xian leans over Cirrus and grabs the warlock by the front of his robes.  Leaning in, his hot breath stinking of rotten flesh, Li laughs in Cirrus' face and drags the Warlock outside, the Oni floating above the ground. Growling, the Oni attempts to cast a Curse upon the warlock but fails. Roaring in anger, the Oni then tosses the warlock twenty feet to land hard on the gravel.

The zombies in they foyer climb to their feet on the stairs and seeing their allies, and enemies out front of the destroyed manor door, they shamble forwards to the only targets they can see.  

At the back of the Foyer, Patches is cornered, an assassin in front of her and another having burst through a doorway behind and to her right.  She grabs the door and swings it behind her as she barges past the assassin and into Mr. Shon's office, sprinting for the servant corridors running behind the walls of the lower floor, the swinging door blocking the assassins blade.  Entering the servant corridors, she sprints through them and bursts into the Ballroom, startling her allies within as she leans heavily against the nearby wall, bleeding and catching her breath.

The two assassins rush after Patches but the speedy elf outpaces them easily.

Out front the Red Robed creature laughs, surveying the scene.  Reaching toward the heavens and addressing Doc B, it yells out in its strangely modulated voice that "I too can call upon the storm" and a massive chain of lightning cascades down into JmJm, Tark and the Arcane hand grasping at the Amnian wizard; Farrim.  The blast tears up the ground and the smell of ozone permeates the area, the heroes all spasming and bleeding from the massive blast.

Calling up from the crushing arcane hand, Farrim calls "Corpsetaker! Help me!" only for the Red Robed figure to respond with "Help yourself, Fool!".  Swearing, Farrim enacts a Dimension door and teleports across the gardens, taking cover behind a large hedgerow much closer to his allies and more importantly; leaving the hand behind.  Farrim then takes a potion from his belt and swigs it, floating 20ft off the ground as he takes flight.

The arcane hand rushes to catch up, covering the same distance in a blur, as it goes to close around the wizard once more, Farrim desperately raises his hands, creating a shield and stopping the hand from closing as it sparks off the defensive spell.

Seeing the predicament his ally is in, the little halfling archer Dellig takes aim and lets two arrows fly into the arcane hand, the magical arrows finally unraveling the spell and destroying it. The archer then re-positions to get a good bead on JmJm and Tark.

JmJm and Tark have the cleric; Salama, surrounded and lay into her. Slashing across her front and slamming into her back, the two deal terrible blows to the half-orc.  Stumbling and shaking and barely alive after the onslaught, the Half Orc calls to the skies.  She roars as a column of burning fire descends on her, burning her body to ash as the explosion of radiant fire pushes Tark and JmJm back.

As the cleric is incinerated, one of the assassins rushes from the manor to engage JmJm.  

As she does so, Li extends a hand and curses Tark with blindness just as the furious Halfling charges the Oni, screaming that Li is a family killer.

The house is now fully burning and the third floor begins to collapse in on itself.  Across the city, fires burn and another fireball goes up.  In the harbor, the rampaging Dragon continues its assault, belching flame and smashing ships.  Flashes can be seen over at the keep, offset from the flashes of lighting during the downpour of the storm.

The heroes in the ballroom look up and see Xor rush by the open door out in the gardens, the assassin making an arcane gesture.  A burst of Faerie fire expands in the room but everyone manages to dive aside, the licking flames failing to catch anyone.  Swearing, the assassin darts back into cover on the outside of the doors. As Oana takes her shots at the flying Fey'Anon, her two arrows puffing a mirror image each into smoke.

Inside the ballroom, Gneiss turns and sees one of the assassins stumbling in the burning Dining room and the big man roars and charges, laying into the surprised assassin with his energized halberd.  The man stumbles under the assault and almost goes down beneath the strikes before retaliating and stabbing Gneiss badly with his poisoned blade.

Chani turns and hearing movement outside the ballroom, rushes to the only closed doors and attempts to barricade them.  Moments later they are smashed inwards, her quarterstaff shattering as she had used it to brace the doors.  A hail of crossbow bolts lance in and Chani manages to deflect them as Ernst rushes by to try and help her brace the door.

Buumi moves to the door Patches just came through, holding it against the incoming assassins and healing the Drow with his aura.  As he holds the door, it slams into the unprepared paladin and pushes him back enough for the door to swing wide.  The faerie-fire-flamed assassin pulls up short in surprise, face to face with the incensed Paladin.

Out back, behind the kitchens, one of the assassins is in a predicament.  Surrounded on all sides by a box of arcane fire, the assassin has only one option and attempts to leap through the Wall of Fire.  Even protected by his cloak, he cannot survive and is incinerated in a scream, barely audible over the roar of the flames.

Inside the kitchens, the Assassin takes a swipe at the bloodied Gundren but is parried away, now alone, the assassin disengages and flees into the hall.  Not to be left alone, Gundren fires at the fleeing man, hitting him with grazing shots and pursuing close behind.

Out front, Cirrus gets to his feet, bleeding and bruised and lashes out with an Eldritch blast, pummeling the floating Oni and launching him back thirty feet to slam into the burning wall of the manor.  The warlock then turns and flees into the gardens, diving into cover inside one of the fountains.

Doc B sees her comrade rushing into cover and calls down another blast of furious lightning on the Oni, burning him badly and then rushing to JmJm's side, healing at the ready and supports her friend as the Oni, zombies and an assassin bear down on them.

Behind the manor, Fey takes note of the situation and a lance of fire streaks from his hand, the fireball detonating at the back of the house.  The wall is torn away, the hole ragged and burning and showering the assassins in the servant hall with burning debris. Not waiting to see his handiwork, the Wizard darts around the corner of the building just as another volley of arrows streaks up at him, taking out the last few mirror images.

In the ballroom, one of the now exposed Assassins misty steps into the room and atop a small table, takes aim with his repeating crossbow and loosing a volley.  Patches parries two out of the air, the last bolt glancing off Buumi's armor.

As she parries and repositions, Patches calls upon her platinum skull mask and copy of herself appears in the middle of the room, just in time to take a volley throwing daggers from Xor outside.

Seeing the illusion, one of the assassins pulls his last ruby from his fireball necklace and tosses it into the room, the chamber filled with fire for an instant.  The assassin had misjudged the radius of the explosion though and he and his comrades are scorched by the blast, their cloaks diminishing the damage.

Recovering from the blast, Buumi lays into the assassin in front of him, swearing, shouting and crying out for his fallen family.  A massive strike of his hammer leaves the assassin stumbling, blood dripping from underneath his gas mask.

Meanwhile, Chani and Ernst have rushed the other assassin that misty stepped into the room, laying into the man and quickly overwhelming him.  As Ernst sinks his rapier into the assassin's belly, Chani kicks his knee out and he falls just in time to take two shots in the chest from Patches revolver.  He drops dead.

Patches then spins and pumps her last two shots into the man facing Buumi.

He staggers and then turns to flee out of the burning hole blown by Fey's Fireball, retreating into the gardens.

In the bloodied and fiery kitchens, Gundren rushes out in pursuit of the fleeing assassin, striking the fleeing warrior with several more shots.

The assassin stumbles but still fires its weapon.  Across the foyer, Gneiss finishes up the assassin he's battling and sees the encounter out front.  Rushing forwards, Gneiss makes it half way across the foyer before the assassins bolts find him.  The big man takes three, staggering to the ground as the deadly poison takes its toll.  Gneiss falls dead to the ground.

Out front the assassin bears down on JmJm and the Bard reels.  Thinking quickly, and just as worried about Doc B, he whistles and casts Crown of Madness on the assassin which promptly turns and cuts down one of the zombies as it passes her. 

The other zombie shambles up to a blind Tark and swings wildly at the monk, connecting solidly on the enraged halfling. The halfling returns the blow ten times over and pummels the animated corpse of Marta into oblivion.

Li laughs as the two corpses are destroyed and floats below Corpsetaker, back out front of the building and gathers cold to him.  Reaching out, a cone of howling cold jets out, covering the front of the building in jagged ice.  JmJm, Doc, Tark and the assassin are all struck and only through the quick healing of Doc B are they kept alive.

As the Assassins stumbles back, her glassy eyes look around confused, the crown of madness still in effect.

Crouched nearby, Cirrus looks up into the sky and thinks that enough is enough.  Calling on the power of Selune, he banishes Corpsetaker and Li Xian from the prime material.  As shafts of moonlight descend on them both, Corpsetaker vanishes in a flash.  Li seems to grow darker for a second and then shrugs off the spell, the powerfully built creature seeming to physically throw the power away. Cirrus ducks back into cover in the cold water of the fountain and looks up.  Directly at the Amnian wizard.

Farrim has chosen his moment and positioned himself perfectly. Circling his hands, they glow with a ruby energy and he lashes out with a Disintegration spell. Cirrus dives to the side, his very life depending on it.  The line of ruby energy lances out and strikes the fountain where he just was, instantly burning away a 10ft cube of material in the garden, the water flowing into the space and leaving the fountain dry.

Cirrus looks up in shock, realizing how close he just came and leaps from the ruined cover, diving under a hedge.

A flash in the sky and Corpsetaker returns. Having broken the Banishment, the Red robed figure laughs at the warlock and directs Li to deal with him.

The warlock pauses his battle with Tark and grabs the monk from his back, tossing him down to the dirt before darting over to the Warlock.

The huge creature looming over him again, Cirrus closes his eyes just as the flint blade strikes in and a tomb of diamond hard ice forms around him.  Li's weapon hits the ice, chipping it, but leaving Cirrus unharmed.

Above the city, two more flashes light the sky and then the air is rent by the cries of two adult dragons.  As the newcomers fly over the city, they are lit from the fires burning throughout Neverwinter.  The light shows the gold and blue of Anaxtrasa and Aurinax. The two adult dragons beeline for the harbor, straight for the Ancient Red wreaking havoc there.

Seeing the arrival of the dragons, Corpsetaker pauses in its assault.  Calculating quickly, the creature's voice booms out "We are leaving.  Retreat!"

Hearing the booming voice, the blind Tark turns in its direction and calls upon the shadows, sucking all the sound from around the creature and casting Silence upon it.

Upon hearing the call to retreat, the Assassins begin to scatter, misty stepping out into the garden and fleeing into the night.

Xor and Oana both down potions of flying and begin to flee up into the night sky as Buumi, Patches, Ernst and Chani rush from the burning building and in pursuit.

Overzealous, Ernst outpaces his allies and comes up behind one of the fleeing assassins.  As he does, the man spins, his dagger finding the throat of the nobleman.  Ernst falls to the grass, dead.

Screaming in denial, Buumi stops his pursuit and rushes to his brother.  He pulls a diamond from his belt and prays to helm not to let another family member die.  The gem glows and is absorbed by the corpse and the wounds close, Ernst begins breathing again.

Just as one of the assassins goes to slip away, Patches rushes forward and stabs him in the back of the leg.  The man falls and Patches quickly pulls a tripwire from her bag and garrotes the man.  He struggles for a few seconds before falling unconscious and the Drow relents, wanting a live prisoner to interrogate later...

Hearing the call to retreat and seeing his target flee out of sight, Gundren doesn't need to be told twice and rushes to the nearest window.  Gwen leaps through, shattering it and Gundren piles out of the burning building just as the smoke begins to get to him.

Fey hears the call too and flies further around to the front of the burning manor, the mansion on it's last legs and about to collapse.  The wizard sees Farrim, floating above the battlefield and preparing a teleport spell. Fey darts close and unleashes a Counterspell, but Farrim expected this and counters.  Dellig, Li, Corpsetaker and Farrim vanish in a flash of arcane light just as the Oni unleashes one more cone of cold across the front of the house.

As it goes, Corpsetaker imparts a gift to Cirrus.  A feeblemind enchantment takes a hold of the ice encrusted warlock and he falls within himself.  As the spell takes effect, it makes Cirrus a prisoner in his own mind; a mental vegetable with almost no control of his body.  Cirrus turns and sees familiar faces and drooling, shambles toward them.

The assassins all flee into the night, leaving behind the burning estate and the Bumidere family in ruins.   As the attackers recede into the night, the front gates of the estate are thrown wide and twenty city guard rush down the gravel path toward the manor, led by one of the Dragonborn mercenaries.

All of the Heralds are battered, bloody and confused, but the fight still rages elsewhere in the city.  The dragons battle above the harbor and flashes can still be seen from the direction of the keep.  The storm rumbles and no word has been heard from Sundabar since the start of the attack...
