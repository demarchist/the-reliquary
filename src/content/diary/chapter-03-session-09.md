JmJm leaped onto his animated carpet and rode it forward to attack the Alhoon, swiping at the creature with his smoking cutlass and landing several good hits. The Stone Golem seized the carpet from the air, and the Alhoon disintegrated it with a casual touch. JmJm stared in disbelief at the creature's power, decided he was outmatched, and fled the chamber with Steven on his back.

## Fighting Retreat

Tark and Cirrus rushed forward to grab Patches and Lady Faye, cutting them free and pulling them from the dais. Seeing the Alhoon's power and exhausted from the previous battles, the group decided on a fighting retreat. Gundren and Lothli laid down covering fire — Lothli, enraged at the sight of an undead abomination, planted arrow after arrow into the creature's vital organs. The Alhoon raised a shield to block a Thundercannon blast, but JmJm returned and used his cutting words to negate the magical protection. Panicking, the Alhoon raised a globe of invulnerability and took cover behind a stone bench, sending the golem forward to engage the group.

As Tark pulled back, he hurled the ruby earring at the golem — but the Alhoon dispelled the magic mid-flight. The ruby hit the ground and shattered.

The portal activated again. Veygar and his assassin materialized in front of it. The Duergar leader shot the Alhoon twice with bolts, then called out to the group — wishing them luck and tossing a signet ring into the room. "Ask the Drow about it," he said, and retreated through the gate.

## The Kill

Badly wounded and desperate, the Alhoon attempted one final action. The moment it raised its head, Lothli put an arrow through it. The undead Illithid collapsed.

With the Alhoon destroyed, Gundren turned his Thundercannon on the Stone Golem and sprayed it with magical grease. The ungainly construct crashed to the floor, unable to find traction. JmJm, Buumi, and Zhink swarmed it and smashed it apart.

Sensing the portal's runes beginning to overload, the group quickly gathered what they could — a large amethyst, the Alhoon's head and hands for Fëanon, the spell Counterspell from the creature's remains, an intact mechanical spider, and Veygar's signet ring — before the chamber tore itself apart.

## The Troll Hills

The group emerged from the ancient ruins into the morning sunlight of the Sword Coast, some twenty miles from Baldur's Gate in the Troll Hills. They set up camp to recuperate, patching wounds and recovering magical energies around a campfire.

Patches studied the signet ring — it belonged to a Drow noble priestess. In the quiet of the campfire, she told the group the truth: she had been an agent of Bregan D'aerthe before entering Lady Faye's service. She had found the priestess dead in the Underdark, along with a baby male Drow. She had taken the child and hidden him in the Moonwood near Silverymoon.
