Leaping onto his animated carpet, JmJm then rode his carpet forward to attack the Alhoon.  Swiping at it with his Smoking cutlass, he got several good hits before the Stone Golem managed to grab the carpet from the air.  With a casual touch, the Alhoon disintegrated the carpet.  Leaping from it, JmJm stares in disbelief at the power of the Alhoon, and quickly decides he is out matched.  JmJm then proceeds to flee the chamber, with Steven on his back. 

Tark and Cyrrus manage to rush forwards and grab Patches and Lady Faye and make their way out of the chamber.  The group at this point, seeing the power of the Alhoon, and tired from the previous battles, decide to perform a fighting retreat, pulling from the room with the hostages and JmJm.  Gundren and Lothli lay down a hail of fire on the Alhoon.  Seeing the undead monstrosity, Lothli is enraged, fighting against one of the very things she vowed to hunt.  Arrow after arrow found it's mark, digging into it's vital organs and head.  Panicking, the Alhoon raised a shield to block a Thundercannon blast, but failed as JmJm returned and used his cutting words to negate the magical protection.  Instead, the Alhoon raised a globe of spell invulnerability and took cover behind a stone bench, sending the Golem forwards to engage the party.  As he left the chamber, Tark threw the magical fireball ruby at the Golem, but with a gesture, the Alhoon dispelled the magic and the ruby fell to the ground, shattering.

As the group redirected some fire to the Golem and mechanical spiders, which had been harassing the group with magical fire, the portal activated once more, and Veygar and his assassin became visible in front of it.  Shooting the Alhoon twice with bolts, Veygar then called to the group, wishing us luck and tossing a ring into the room, telling us to ask the Drow about it.  Veygar then retreated through the gate.

Badly wounded, the Alhoon attempted one last desperate action, but as soon as he raised his head, Lothli plugged him with an arrow, killing it.   With the Alhoon annihilated, Gundren turned his focus to the Stone Golem marching towards them and sprayed it with magical Grease.  The ungainly stone golem went down in a heap, unable to get traction.  JmJm, Buumi and Zinc attacked, destroying the Golem. 

Looking towards the portal, the group saw that the runes were beginning to glow, sensing the gate going to explode, the group quickly recovered the signet ring Veygar threw, the corpse of the Alhoon and the gemstone from the golem.

And a signet ring from a Drow Noble house.

The group left the ancient ruins, emerging into the morning sunlight of the Sword Coast, some twenty miles from Baldurs gate, in the Troll hills.  Setting up camp to recuperate, the group relaxed around a campfire, patching wounds and recovering magical energies.  Speaking with Patches, the group discovers that she used to be an agent of Bregan D'Aerthe before working for Lady Faye and that the Signet ring belonged to a Drow Noble priestess she found dead in the underdark with a baby male Drow that she then took and hid in the Moonwood near Silverymoon.
