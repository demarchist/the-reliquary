From the rooftop, Patches watched the harbour water churn and boil as an undead horde erupted from the depths — everything that had ever died along the seafloor was marching on Baldur's Gate. Gundren and Tark rushed from the Tavern of Doors demanding to know what was happening. The group barely had time to explain before the sounds of brutal combat erupted from the docks.

## The Specters

The mist rose again, thickening and obscuring sightlines. A host of specters streamed from the fog and attacked. Several of the group were assaulted mentally, ghosts seizing control of their bodies. The paladin Sir Teft and his men rallied alongside the group, destroying specters and driving ghosts from the possessed — though one soldier was aged decades in seconds by a ghost's touch and another fled screaming. The last spirits were expelled from Tark and Gundren and quickly destroyed.

## Kangaxx

As the group caught their breath, every eye was drawn skyward. A golden figure floated above the docks, radiant and terrible. Kangaxx raised his hands and tore reality open — a widening rift revealed a starlit void, and at its centre, a dark, unlit planetoid. A wave of alien cold washed over the city. The group felt a vast consciousness press down on them. Fëanon's mind buckled under its weight. A flash of orange light — a meteor streaked from the rift and smashed into the city blocks away. The moment it breached reality, the window sealed and the god-mind's influence vanished. The city's defenders redirected their spells skyward, hammering Kangaxx with everything they had. The golden lich floated in a globe of invulnerability and began returning fire, engaging the Mage's Guild — and likely the Archmage himself.

Panic set in. Cyrrus, who had never faced Kangaxx, wanted to flee immediately. Half the group agreed. Then Ysera fluttered up to Tark's face and spoke into his mind. They had a chance. The meteor was connected to Kangaxx — destroy it, and the lich could be destroyed. She launched skyward in a streak of gold and transformed into her true form: an Ancient Golden Dragon, one of the Disciples of Bahamut. Ysera slammed into Kangaxx and knocked him from the sky.

## Through the Streets

Emboldened, the group resolved to reach the crater. The streets were a warzone — two bat-winged creatures were tearing into a squad of guardsmen ahead. Patches scouted from the rooftops, dropping into a nearby alley to loot a belt of hill giant strength from a dead adventurer while zombies shambled past, oblivious. The rest of the group hit the bat-beasts from behind, enchanting one to sleep and helping the soldiers impale both.

Fëanon felt the minds of ghouls massing in the sewers below and warned the group. They fused one entrance shut with magic and the guards bottlenecked the other, stabbing anything that tried to climb up. From above, Patches surveyed the burning city — undead giants smashing through buildings, paladins fighting back to back against zombie hordes, civilians defending their homes or lying dead in the streets.

The group decided the only way to end the battle was to destroy the meteor. Buumi and Tark had to be convinced that the needs of the many outweighed the few — they left the streets reluctantly. Leaping from rooftop to rooftop, the group covered ground quickly. Cyrrus called down words of encouragement to defending peasants in the name of Selune. Fëanon, astride a smoking ethereal steed, his Alhoon mask glittering, sensed the telltale loop of ghost possession in a group of civilians and drove the spirits from their minds with a gesture, the ruby brain-shaped gemstone on his ring pulsing with light.

## The Crater

The group reached the final building and looked down into the impact site. No corpses — only signs of battle and a dark figure shambling through the mist. Cyrrus banished the fleshling without hesitation. A squad of paladins in the shops below were planning their next move. The group accepted minor healing and agreed on a plan: they would enter the crater while the paladins held the rear.

Inside the crater, a gust of wind parted the mist and revealed their target — a massive writhing mass of flesh and body parts. Even as they watched, a fleshling tore free of the mass and shambled off into the city. Heavily armoured undead stood guard around it, and flickering orange lightning arced through the air in a dangerous cloud. The group steeled themselves.
