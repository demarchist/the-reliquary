Locking up the newly acquired Instant Fortress, the group sets a watch and begins to rest up as Cirrus and Gundren begin to discuss what to do with the bodies of his kin.

The two of them decide to send the four bodies to Sundabar via Instant Messenger and the box that the spell creates.

Gundren decides to send the remains to his Cousin Nora Rockseeeker, a priest of Moradin in Sundabar.

The first body is sent, along with a letter from Gundren.

A few moments later, a letter returns to them, affirming that the bodied are welcome and that Nora will ask about the passwords for the Instant fortress.

Over the next few hours, all four bodies are sent and Gundren receives one final note from his kin, in reference to the password for the Tower.

It simply reads: “Ask the Tower”.

A little confused, Gundren turns, looking about the Iron walls and floor of the place and asks out loud.

Nothing happens.

His eyes however are drawn to a metal sigil of the Delzoun nation, the symbol of Gauntlgrym.

Walking over, Gundren places a hand on the sigil and feels a presence.

The tower has a rudimentary consciousness, a spirit.

Gundren inquires and discovers that the tower is an Elemental of sort and bound to the tower by his kin and by its own wishes.

If a Delzound Dwarf asks, the Tower will shrink and grow.

Happy at the new acquisition, Gundren takes a break to rest.

The next twelve hours are uneventful.

Patches hears some commotion out in the tunnels, but nothing close by.

Cirrus takes the last watch.

While he’s reading over the** Book of Phases**, the holy book of Selune, he hears a strange scratching and scrabbling on the first floor.

Thinking it beneath him, Cirrus returns to his book.

Hours later, the group awakes fully rested (despite the beating heart of the Goristro and Demonic presence in the Underdark).

As the group prepares to head out, Patches spots something that stuns her for a second.

She sees a Rat.

The thing scurries behind the bunkbeds and Patches points it out to her companions.

They pull the bed out but don’t see the Rat, until someone spots it clinging to the backside of the frame.

Tark grabs the creature, noting a strange wisp of blue energy about it’s head and it has solid red eyes.

As the thing desperately scrabbles away from his grip, Gwen leaps over and scoops it in her maw...which promptly slams shut bisecting the creature.

Feanon, who had been watching from across the room, comes over to take a closer look (when Tark mentions the strange nimbus).

Inspecting the corpse, Feanon can’t be certain, but he thinks that it might have been a Cranium Rat - an Illithid spy.

The group turns to Patches, asking if she is aware of any Hives in the area.

The only one she’s heard of is far, far to the west, near the great Fungal Waste of Araumycos.

The discussion is cut short as the echoing yips and baying of gnolls begins to reach their ears.

The group grows quiet and attend the Arrow slits, looking out into the cavern.

A few minutes later, a group of Hyenas move into the area, sniffing and snuffling around like dogs.

Moments later, a Gnoll appears from the same tunnel, takes one look at the tower and then ducks back into cover.

It peeks out, eyeing the tower, only to catch a bullet through the skull as the group attacks, killing the Hyenas and Gnoll instantly.

A few minutes after that, more Hyenas appear, rushing to the corpses to feast on the fresh blood.

As the newly arrived Hyenas feast, they begin to twist and change, transforming and growing...into Gnolls.

Cirrus remarks “ah, so that’s how it happens”, before obliterating them with Eldritch blasts.

Hearing more howling from down the tunnels and remembering Yeenoghu’s promise to find them, the group decides it’s time to move.

They exit the tower and Gundren begins to shrink the thing.

A minute later, they rush from the cavern, heading back the way they came from the day before.

Making due haste, the group manages to stay ahead of the pursuing Gnolls for hours.

That is, until Cirrus takes the lead, directing the group very confidently in the wrong direction.

Patches quickly recognizes the error and convinces them to turn back to where they took the wrong turn, but a scouting party of Gnolls catches up to them, forcing a small fight.

The gnolls are slaughtered quickly, but the sound gives away the group’s position to the greater horde.

They run.

For hours they are doggedly pursued.

Eventually though, the group manages to put some distance between them and the packs of Gnolls as Tark finds a crevice that ascends to a higher level of tunnels.

They group makes it up and finally manages to lose the pursuit.

Back near where they split from the path the day before, the group looks to Cirrus who has the tracking pendant from Vizeron.

Holding the Pendant tight, Cirrus senses that the thing is growing warmer as they head back to the main path.

With the yipping of Gnolls now far off in the distance, the group now finds themselves in dark natural tunnels, occasionally interspersed with ancient and decrepit stonework.

They push deeper into the heart of the Labyrinth, following the pendant as it grows warmer as they near **The Gallery of Angels**.


Hours later, the group stops, spotting trouble up ahead.

At a tunnel opening to a larger cavern, they spot a couple of Hyena’s feasting on corpses, already beginning to change and transform into Gnolls.

More concerning, on the tunnel walls and ceiling rest Chasme Demons.

The normally insectoid things are covered in matted fur and have a more Canid appearance.

Chasme’s of Yeenoghu.

Tark summons darkness and silence to wrap the group and Patches then steps into the Ethereal Plane.

Patches moves in to scout.

As she explored the cave system, she notes several skirmishes between Gnolls and Minotaurs.

She returns to the group and lets them know that the whole area is currently embroiled in a battle between Gnolls of Yeenoghu and Minotaurs of Baphomet.

They look to Cirrus, who clutches the Pendant, he says that the Gallery of Angels is close, they have to push into this area.

Knowing what to do, the group attacks the Chasme demons.

The battle begins.

With the element of surprise, the group lays into the Chasme’s.

The demons are slaughtered in short order and the group pushes past, rushing forth, Cirrus directing based on the Amulet.

They move into combat with a batch of Minotaurs and Gnolls.

As the bestial monsters fall before the group, they note movement back the way they had come and see a Roper moving along the ceiling, toward the corpses left in the group’s wake.

Gundren begins blasting the creature and kills it in short order.

As the group battles the Minotaurs, the beasts prove to be dangerous, charging the party and inflicting wounds.

It takes an effort from all of them to push through and destroy the demonic beasts.

Moving down the tunnels, now bloodied from the skirmish, Cirrus feels the heat of the amulet.

It’s growing colder.

Cirrus stops and turns around, following the emanations of the amulet until he finds a non-descipt piece of tunnel wall.

Looking carefully, he discerns a seam in the rock and discovers what he believes to be a door.

Cirrus calls to the others and they gather quickly, using magic and bombs to fill the tunnels nearby with obscuring smoke.

Under cover, the group heaves agains the ancient door and manages to crack the buildup of minerals.

The doors swing inward, revealing an ancient tunnel descending into darkness.

Trepidatious, the group moves into this new tunnel, closing it behind them as they hear a Pack of Gnolls nearing their position.

Descending steadily, the group moves several hundred feet into this new tunnel, the rock ancient and the dust thick.

Up ahead, Patches spots an end to the tunnel.

An ancient metal door stands, closed.

It looks un- ornamented and somewhat crude in it’s construction.

An open padlock hangs from the door and scrapes in the stone show that the door has opened many times in the past, though it is closed currently.

As the group nears, Feanon spots the gleam of magic and stills the group.

Ahead, lies a powerful glyph, blocking the group from entering the Gallery of Angels…
