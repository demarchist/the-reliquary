Back in the tower, Buumi and Tark head back to the Orc village to report to the troops what just happened.

They leave Bolg in the Teleport room to regenerate.

Cirrus, Patches and Feanon all decide to remain in the tower.

Patches heads to the library to do some research while Feanon and Cirrus head to the labs.

In the labs, Cirrus feels drawn to the Crystal plate given to them by the Svirfneblin of Blingdenstone.

Investigating it, Cirrus finds that the holy item is hooked up to wires and apparatus designed to measure it’s various energies.

This offends Cirrus and he calls Feanon over to argue about how best to research the thing.

Down in the main library, with assistance from Beryan, Patches manages to find some interesting books on the pre-Crown War Dark Elves known as the **Illythiri.**

Having a hard time with the translation though, Patches ends up in the labs, watching Feanon and Cirrus argue over the Crystal relic.

With Beryan’s assistance though, the two of them seem to have actually made some progress and have discovered that the Crystal is the heart of a ritual spell, a lens for something related to **Prismeum**, a magical material previously unknown to Beryan the Sage.

They further determine that three powerful spellcasters are needed for this ritual - two of the Arcane and one of Celestial weal.

One Arcanist to perform the ritual, a second to cast a Prismatic beam into the Crystal and the third to call down **Moonfire **into the crystal Relic.

After some discussion, Feanon, Patches and Cirrus decide to head to **Svartalfheim and the City of Dokkar **to inquire about the history of the Illythiri Dark Elves and whatever **Moonfire** may be.

Planeshifting to the gates of the city of Dokkar, the group is welcomed inside, though reminded of their limitations (much to Patches annoyance).

As they head inside, they note many small glowing orbs of light moving around the place and determine them to be souls of the dead.

Indeed, on their second visit now, the group thinks they can begin to tell which Elves here are alive and which are dead from their auras and slight desaturation (for the dead ones)

Cirrus leads the group up to the limits of the second level, to the tailor he met that weaved his robe with “Moonweave” cloth, thinking this may be a good starting point for their Moonfire investigation.

Indeed, upon meeting the tailor in what amounts to a shrine to Selune, they discover that Moonweave cloth is silk infused with Moonfire, called down in a ceremony by the heads of the Tailors guild in the city.

Indeed, she explains that all sufficiently powerful clerics of Elistraee and Selune can call on Moonfire, a physical manifestation of the divine power of the moon.

Wanting more answers, Cirrus heads higher in the city, seeking to climb to the limits of the sixth tier and the great temples there.

Patches and Feanon, limited as they are to the first two levels of the city decide to head to the library and to the Guild hall of the Tailors to meet with **Madame Toux.**

Cirrus finds the grandest temple in the district (owned by **Clan Tinnavedir) **and heads inside, passing chambers of meditation and prayer and being directed to a great grove, seemingly contained within the stone core of the city.

Here, Cirrus meets with an ancient high priestess and sits with her for a while.

She explains that Moonfire is a gift from the Goddess and will be bestowed upon Cirrus as a right of passage in his great journey.

He must continue on the path.

Having faith, Cirrus nods in understanding and proceeds to relax in the temple a while.

Meanwhile, Patches and Feanon find and talk with Madame Toux and get a similar explanation.

They are also told that the next Moonfire ceremony will be in just under a month, coinciding with the next full moon on the Prime Material Plane - an event seemingly synchronized across many worlds.

The group asks to visit and bear witness to the event.

Madame Toux welcomes them to return at that time.

Cirrus rejoins the group at the Guildhall and the three of them head to the library to find any information on the Illithyri Dark Evles.

While there, they make a discovery; that the ancient empire of the Dark Elves, pre-lolth curse, existed in what is modern day Chult in Faerun.

With a place to now continue the search for how to cleanse the corruption of Lolth, the group rests. 

Patches visits her brother Finn, and then the group heads out, returning to the Barony after a only few days in Dokkar.


Back in the Barony, the Dragons have not reappeared and the Oni that came with them were repelled from the Barony, it seems that all is well currently.

Wanting to still head to Scornubel to deal with the Efreeti, the group reconvenes at Feanons tower, planning on Teleporting to Baldur’s Gate and hiring a boat to take them up river to Scornubel.

They teleport to the Mage’s College of Baldur’s Gate.

The teleportation ring deposits the group in the main hall of the College

The place is a bustle of activity and feels more like a museum than a school.

As they move to leave, they do note residual damage from the Amnian attack that started the war.

Heading out into the city, the group asks Patches where they should go for a boat.

She leads them to the docks and indeed, to the same Inn where so long ago, they met Cirrus: **The Mermaid’s Arms.**

Baldur’s Gate hasnt changed much since the group was last here, though they do get a lot more gawking looks from the average citizens.

Indeed, the people here know of the Heralds and there is even a statue of the group in the Temple district.

The group though heads straight to the docks where they waste no time in finding a young river-barge captain.

Gundren purchases the entire Barge, inducting **Gil**, the boat captain, into the Rockseeker Corporation as their newest asset.

The group hops onto the Barge and begin to head out of the city.

As they are leaving though, the guards show up and begin to protest that Gil is wanted for minor crimes, though the guards back down when they realize that the Heralds are Gil’s passengers.

The group gets gawked at as they leave the city, Tark being very conspicuous and running across water to buy food from vendors before being asked to lay low a bit.

The boat heads out of Baldur’s Gate and begins the trek up the river Chionthar.

Passing military convoys heading to the front, and other tradesmen on the river, the group makes good time and has an uneventful first day.

As they pull into a small town dock for the night, Cirrus brings something up to the group.

Long ago, when he first met them, he had intended to lure the group out of the city and to the Wood of Sharp Teeth, to the Gorgon’s Maw to be slain by The Marilith.

That obviously did not happen, but the Maw still exists, and likely still contains something terrible.

He asks the group to come with him to that place to cleanse it of evil.

Patches is skeptical and mentions that she had no idea Cirrus was so patient, trying to lure them to their doom after so much time.

She’s only half joking and Cirrus takes offense, claiming that he has changed!

Patches brings up the followers in the Barony removing body parts and swapping them with metal and a few other members of the group agree that it’s pretty culty and not a good look.

Cirrus grumbles about it, saying he cant control what his followers do.

The others remain unconvinced, but do agree to go with him to The Gorgon’s Maw.

The group has Gil stay in town while they ride south, to the Woods.

Gundren lends Buumi and Patches Gwen as a mount, saying he will catch up on Arkto later with Tark and Snorbul.

Cirrus and Feanon both summon their magical mounts and the group splits, with the main force heading south.

Travel is quick and with the group riding atop magical beasts, they are not accosted/outpace anything that might rise against them.

They quickly make the Woods border after only a half day of riding.

Vaguely remembering the way, Cirrus leads them West, skirting the edge of the forest.

As he notes a familiar crest of rock, Patches notes movement in the forest from a Tribe of Goblins shadowing them.

The Goblins attack, but the group puts half the tribe to sleep and then easily annihilates the lot rest of them, save for the Goblin Boss who has his hand blasted off and is left unconscious.

Continuing on, away from the battle, the group notes the landscape changing in subtle ways, becoming dark and twisted.

Feanon detects a subtle thread of the arcane and when he pulls on it, determines there is an enchantment in this area of the Forest.

He leads the group through the enchantment, finding a hidden path.

Following it, the group comes across the dark cavern of The Gorgon’s Maw.

Before heading inside, the group looks around, noting grisly warnings tied up in the trees - ears, skin and dismembered limbs.

Feanon voices his suspicions based on the magic he’s encountering; Hags.

Patches pulls on the cowl of her Piwafwi and heads into the dark hole in the forest.

She finds more grisly wards and avoids them, getting far enough into the hole to hear chanting from three crackling voices.

She returns to the group and tells them what she found and then leads them all into The Maw to face the Hags.

The group picks their way into the depths of the cave, the ritual spellcasting keeping them from being heard.

They move into position and spot the hags in a chamber down a long and narrow hallway.

They see two Night Hags and one Annis Hag conducting a summoning ritual involving a blood sacrifice.

Not wanting to wait and see what they summon, the group rushes the Hags, attacking furiously.

Hitting the fiends hard, the group’s opening attacks are powerful, but not enough to slay the creatures outright.

The Hags reel from the onslaught, caught in tar, shot and hit with spells, but they do not fall.

The fiends begin to cackle with glee, pulling wands of bone and rusty looking knives from their robes as they turn to face their attackers...
