## The Ossuary

The stone golem lay in a heap of crushed marble and oozing tar. Gundren faded into the mist, leaving the group one member short. Tark sagged against the wall until Buumi rushed over with healing.

Patches found a tripwire at one door and a pressure plate beyond the next. Working from an awkward angle, she tripped the mechanism — a hidden blade shot directly at her face. Tark's hand shot out and caught it inches from her eye. Patches gulped, staring at the steel. Tark reassured her and pocketed the new throwing knife.

Beyond the door, the dining hall was a cathedral of death. Dark stains covered the floor. Furniture made entirely of human bones replaced whatever had once stood here — garlands of skulls, four enormous bone mounds in the corners, a chandelier of yellowed vertebrae hanging above a long bone table. The walls and vaulted ceiling were adorned in a morbidly decorative arrangement of remains. Above the eastern doors, mounted like a trophy, was the skull of a dragon.

The group moved in. Patches scaled the wall to the skull and the moment her hand brushed it, twin points of light blazed in the empty eye sockets. The entire room was bathed in brilliance. The group felt suddenly refreshed and empowered. Tark felt a thrumming energy connect with his staff — a gift from Bahamut, finally awakened. Cyrrus laid a hand on the halfling's shoulder and radiated moonlight. The crow's feet vanished from Tark's eyes; the silver streak in his beard turned orange again. Tark whooped with joy and hugged him.

Buumi dragged the bone table beneath the skull, climbed up, and wrenched the massive thing free, staggering under its weight before tipping it into the bag of holding.

## Strahd

A voice came from behind them. Seated in one of the bone chairs was Strahd — but not the elegant nobleman from dinner. His face was feral, eyes solid red, fangs prominent, hands ending in wicked talons. He told them he had planned to simply kill them and take what he wanted, but with prodding from Rahadin and the note Patches had slipped him, he would prefer to test them instead.

Tark called out that they would never serve a monster. Strahd dissolved into mist and reappeared behind the halfling, raking him with claws. Skeletons animated from the bone piles, pulling ethereal weapons from the air. Ireena charged the nearest with her daggers. Buumi fell back to protect the casters and the unarmed Boris.

Strahd hit Tark hard. Tark and Patches hit back harder — the ethereal tip of the Reaver penetrating Strahd's breastplate and sending him stumbling into mist. He reappeared on the table, crouched next to Boris. His claws lashed out and tore the guard's head from his shoulders. Standing atop the table, drinking the blood spurting from the neck, Strahd surveyed the room.

Fëanon's telepathic command hit Buumi like a bell: *Now.* Buumi pulled the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind from his breastplate and called upon its power. The sun blazed through the chamber. Strahd screamed, threw up a shield of darkness, and teleported away — burning even through his own magic. The skeletons trembled and weakened. Patches and Tark dismantled them as JmJm decapitated the one that had buried an axe in Cyrrus's chest.

Ireena knelt beside Boris's body. Patches moved as if to comfort her — then shifted her aside, reclaimed the holy water she had given the man, and handed the extra to Cyrrus.

## Cyrus Belview

Through the far doors, they found a fog-filled corridor with a sagging ceiling. A dark figure shuffled toward them carrying a lantern — a strange malformed little man with tufts of fur, dog ears, and one large duck foot. He introduced himself as Cyrus Belview, a castle servant, and offered to show them to their rooms.

The group was intrigued. They followed Cyrus to the kitchen, where he poked a restless zombie trying to climb out of his stewpot back in with a wooden spoon. He showed them his room — a mess of bags and adventuring gear belonging to all the long-dead heroes whose bones decorated the previous hall. Cyrus had arranged the bones himself. Sometimes he had even stripped the meat.

Patches reached for the Reaver. The others told her to stand down. They learned the crypts were one level below — where they needed to find Sergei's tomb — and the library was above, where Mordenkainen's spellbook might be found. They settled into Cyrus's cluttered room for a brief rest.

## The Dungeons

Down the hall, Buumi, Tark, and Ireena found a portcullis blocking a wine storage area. Buumi lifted the bars with Tark's help from the other side. One cask held fine wine. The second held something else — when Tark cracked it with his staff, black tar oozed out and lashed at them with tendrils. Buumi's prize armour sizzled where the black pudding struck, leaving a section of weakened steel. He backed away, unwilling to risk more. Tark raised a wall of fire to trap the creature, and they retreated.

The commotion drew Cyrus screaming about his "friend Kevin." Patches intercepted him on the stairs, drove her blade through his back, and Cyrus dissolved to dust. Purple torchlight and patrol sounds came from above. Cyrrus assumed Cyrus's form just as a heavily armed vampire warrior descended with two shadow hounds. The guard sneered at the duck-footed servant babbling about some ooze, turned to leave, and departed — one hound pausing to sniff suspiciously before obeying its master's call.

Cyrrus-as-Cyrus blasted the ooze with an eldritch bolt and dove for cover. Patches dropped from the ceiling onto "Kevin" and finished it. They retreated to Cyrus's room, barred the door, and rested.

Thirty minutes later, footsteps. A much larger patrol. Peytr's deep booming voice demanded to know if the butler had seen anything. Tark wrapped the group in darkness and non-detection. Cyrrus, still in Cyrus's form, answered with blabbering nonsense, sobbing that the group had killed Kevin. Peytr kicked the door off its hinges, loomed over the small figure, and looked around the room. He saw nothing. Cyrrus's performance of the creepy little butler was flawless — tearful sobs, confused babbling, and a helpful suggestion that he had seen the murderers heading upstairs to the towers. Peytr whirled and stormed off with his entourage.

The group let out a collective sigh and settled back down to rest before plunging deeper into the castle.
