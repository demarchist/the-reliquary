**Awaking in the Dark and the Deepening Gloom**

**​**The group packs up their camp as the dome fades. Despite the long rest, the group feels on edge, the lightless Underdark wearing on the nerves of the Surface dwellers.

They head out into the Darkness, Patches leading.

After an hour or two of consistent travel, the group comes to a halt as Cirrus and Patches both note something odd.  

The tunnels up ahead are somehow even darker, the enhanced vision of the two of them being less effective than just moments before.

Tentatively, Cirrus summons his familiar and sends the spider in.  Nothing happens other than the spider's vision becomes more limited and it feels colder.

Fey begins to run some tests and begins to develop a working theory, just as JmJm announces that it's definitely an area close to the Shadowfell.

The group moves up to the edge of the gloom, almost a defined wall, and begin to debate what to do.  

Eventually, they decide to press forward as Cirrus encases himself in frost armor and simply walks in.

Following, they descend into the gloom, the Shadowfell leaking into the tunnels.

The group continues traveling through the cold, Shadowfell filled tunnels until Patchs and Cirrus stop short, seeing movement up ahead at the edge of their visibility.

A creature turns, taking up most of the tunnel and lets out an ominous wail.  Large and bulbous, looking like a deformed fetus atop two spike-like legs and its arms ending in similar spikes, the hunched and elongated neck ending in a bulbous head with black, weeping eyes.

It launches its two spiked arms into the air, trailing ribbon-like flesh as they lance 60ft toward Cirrus.

Fey rushes forward and crates a swirling wall of ice.  The two harpoons smash into the wall, cracking it.

The rest of the group catches up and take up firing positions, waiting for the strange creature to move toward them through the now much smaller tunnel.

Seeing movement within the swirl of ice, JmJm summons his Arcane hand to attack it.

Seconds later, the creature peers around the ice wall just as it trips a trap set by Patches, immolating the area. 

Gundren unloads with his thundercannon, smashing ice and the flesh of the creature.

No sooner has the creature appeared though than it suddenly vanishes.

Appearing behind Fey'Anon, the creature reaches out and crushes the Wizard in an embrace.

Wailing, the creature draws on the life force of the Wizard, but a glittering intellect fortress flows from Cirrus and shields Fey'Anon from the danger.

Fey creates illusionary duplicates and the rest of the group moves into surround and attack the creature.

In short order, the strange thing is ripped apart by the group and it fades into dark smoke, its essence dispersed back to the Plane of Shadow.

As the group catches their breath though, they hear the wails of other creatures off in the tunnels.  

Tark gathers shadow to them and they begin to speed off, desperate to leave this area before finding more of these bizarre creatures.

Rushing silently through the tunnels, the group manages to narrowly avoid more of the creatures, even as one comes out from an adjacent tunnel just behind them.

They continue on, eventually discovering the edge of these gloom filled tunnels.  They find the "edge" another wall where the gloom simply ends.

However, a two headed creature, resembling a deformed human but with its arms ending in hooks, blocks their path.

Not wanting to bother with another fight, Cirrus calls to Selune and simply Banishes the creature.  The thing is surrounded by silver light and implodes in on itself, vanishing from the Plane.

The group rushes forward and back into the regular tunnels of the Underdark.   "Warmth" returns to them as the coldness of the Shadowfell stops sapping their strength.

Pressing on from the Gloom filled tunnels, Patches takes the lead again and quickly takes them from that dark place.

The group travels for the next dozen hours without major incident.  

JmJm assists the smaller folk in the party scaling a small cliff while Fey keeps track of the arcane currents in the area, trying to keep the largest and most orderly emanations (which he believes are cities) consistent to their direction.
  

**Don't Mess with Wild Magic**

**​**Eventually, Fey feels something brush against his magical senses and he stops to look for the source.

Finding it quickly, Fey discovers a deposit of Faerzress Crystals emanating a steady flow of Magic into the surrounding area.

Curious, Fey approaches and begins to try and draw on the power.

The area 20ft around begins to heat up.

After thirty seconds, Fey realizes that the energy he's gathering is being deposited as heat into the nearby rock. The group notes that patches of stone are beginning to glow red hot and the heat is becoming unbearable.

They flee, and manage to put a dozen feet between them and the area before it liquefies.

The group rushes ahead of the deluge of molten stone. 

JmJm trips.  

Calling on his magic again, a huge Arcane hand scoops the Bard up and propels him forward.

Doc and Gundren, their little legs causing them to lag, hop on to the construct and it carries them from danger.

Breathing heavily, the group turns and catches their breath, the lava flow petering out and cooling behind them.

Patches turns to Fey and whispers harshly "Which rule did you break?! Stop fucking with stuff".

The group continues on for another hour in silence, thinking about the strangeness of this place, so many miles underground.
  

**The Oasis**

Hours of travel go by.**​**

The slight trickling sound of water reaches Patches ears and she stops the group.  Looking around at the T-junction, she remembers this place and remarks that there is a nearby "oasis", a place to camp for the night in relative safety and comfort.

Fey lets out a sigh of relief and asks how many days of this incessant trekking they have left.

Patches stares at the Wizard and then lays it out: They are finishing day three, there are thirteen days of travel left.

Fey swears and shouts "What!?", the lightless underdark warping his sense of time as he thinks/feels that they have been travelling far longer.

He raves for a moment and then declares that "He cannot do this" swirls his arms and gathers power. With a crack of rushing air to fill the space, Fey vanishes, teleporting top-side to Silverymoon.

Everyone looks on, stunned as Fey simply vanishes.  Patches turns to everyone else and asks how he'll get back/find them?

They figure the wizard can take care of himself and move in to check out the Oasis.

They find a small grotto with moss beds, large blue-capped mushrooms, a trickling stream and most importantly, limited ways in and out.

Slipping and squeezing through the tight tunnels, the group discovers the Oasis abandoned and they begin setting up defenses around the entrance.

Meanwhile, Top-side, Fey walks out of the Guild Circle tower and into the cold night air of Silverymoon in February.  Looking up at the stars, Fey plops down on a bench and simply watches them for a time.

In the grotto, Cirrus constructs the Dome of force and everyone begins setting up their camp within.  

Indeed, a small "oven" exists in this space and Patches remarks that it is regularly used by travelers, at least once a month.  

Doc and Patches start a small fire in the natural stone oven and begin to bake some bread from the local Bluecap mushrooms, the caps being ground into powder for flour, the water from the stream and Doc providing a batch of yeast from his cooking pouch.  Before long, the grotto smells of an earthy, blue flatbread and the two of them cook a good two days of bread rations for everyone (24 servings).

Topside, Fey has found a beautiful hotel and rented a room, having dinner sent to him and a nice hot water bottle to keep him warm at night.

Below, the group lounges in relative luxury, the Bluecaps throwing a soft amber luminescence, allowing them to see in the normal light spectrum for the first time in the Underdark.  They converse softly, remarking how hostile of a place this is.  Patches agrees, but softly mentions that they have no idea.

Fey'Anon falls asleep full, warm and content in a Down bed.

The group begins to settle in below to sleep through the night but Gundren shifts uncomfortably and pulls something from underneath his bulk and tosses it.

Patches catches it and takes a look, the others peering at it curiously: A scale of metal with what looks like a large cat claw puncturing it.

JmJm remarks "Displacer Beast" and Patches nods, pointing out the Scale-work is clearly Duergar.  

They think on the strange artifact and head to sleep or Reverie as they enjoy a smoke of Halfling Leaf and Old Toby (they note that they don't have a TON of leaf and might need to send Fey with a shopping list next time).

Those of the group that sleep, dream dark dreams and suffer from fitful nightmares...

The morning comes top side and Fey awakes to a sunny winter day.  He washes and heads to a nearby cafe for breakfast.  Eating pancakes, Scones and a hearty porridge, he lounges for a while sipping a hot drink.

The group awakens in the Underdark, those that slept feeling a pall over them.  JmJm in particular looks terrible and mentions he barely slept due to nightmares of creeping, oozing death.  Doc pipes up, mentioning he had a nightmare about being chased in a Labyrinth by a great beast and Tark mentions he dreamt of a tentacled beast ripping him apart the other night.  Gundren grumbles about the baying of Gnolls in his dreams.  

The group goes silent, wondering what the dreams might mean and Patches heads to collect her traps.

Their dark contemplation is broken as Fey'Anon appears in a pop, sipping on a coffee and looking far too happy.  The somewhat haunted faces of his companions look up at him and Fey greets them with a good morning.

Despite his joviality, something about the Teleports are bothering the Wizard; Leaving the Underdark was far more difficult than it should have been, as was returning.  A riddle for another time.

The group packs up the camp and bids the Oasis farewell, continuing off into the darkness of the tunnels.
  

**The Geode**

**​**The party treks through the dark tunnels for the next five hours.  Cirrus decides to try and keep everyone focused and helps Patches keep order, reminding everyone of the travel rules.  Remarkably, it has the desired effect and everyone is business like for the first half of the day.

As with every day of travel so far though, eventually something comes up.  This time however, it appears to be light.  

The group stops and sends in Cirrus' familiar.

Moments later, Cirrus reports that a massive Geode is before them, the wall of it cracked as the tunnels have shifted slightly. 

Over fifty feet across and covered in gleaming crystals, the group shares excited glances, wondering if the Geode might be a treasure to be plundered.

The group moves in, but they stop at the edge of the Geode, watching.  Fey notes several shifting forms in the crystals and reaches out with his Arcane senses.

Elementals, six of them.

Rashly, JmJm leaps atop one crystal and begins hopping his way into the center of the Geode.  Balancing atop a large purple crystal, he waits.

Nothing happens and the Bard returns to the group with as much flair as when he entered.  The Elementals did not seem bothered by him.

Deciding to go out on a limb, Fey strides forward and speaks with a strange rumbling language: Primordial.

The group is shocked, having no idea that their friend could communicate with beings of the Elemental Plane.  

Doc B coos in appreciation.

The Elementals shift and move in, gathering to talk with this strange mortal that they can communicate with.

It turns out that the Geode is their home and considered a Garden, or work of art.

Tark stares at the glittering crystal elementals in wonder.

Appreciating such things, Fey remarks on their beautiful, orderly home and builds a rapport. 

Cirrus casts Comprehend Languages so he can listen in, while JmJm begins to hum a tune.

Patches notes that the Elementals are distracted and shifts behind a particularly large spur of crystal, picking up two fallen pieces and putting them in her bag before coming around the other side.

No one moves or even seems to notice but the Drow doesn't press her luck.  She does summons her mercurial blade though, thinking they would appreciate the Obsidian sword.

With such a fascinating group of mortals, the Elementals enjoy their conversation and company.  They allow the group to rest in the Geode a while before moving on.

Chatting, the Wizard discovers that the Elementals have sensed a rising tide of corruption in the Underdark emanating from the depths.  They have no idea what it is or where it comes from, but they don't like it.

The group offers the Elementals a new home, under the Red Hill or in the caves underneath the Keep on their barony. 

The Elementals are unsure, but eventually decide to send a single member to check it out. The small crystal creature detaches itself from the geode and begins its trek, shifting and melding seamlessly into the stone wall.

The group takes a short rest and then begin to head out again, leaving the glittering cavern behind them.
  

**The Steam Tunnels**

**​****​**With Pass without Trace on the party, JmJm hums a tune and the others begin to hum along too.  

Patches gives a disapproving glance, but with the stealth magic she relents and even hums a little as well.

Many more uneventful hours go by with Patches leading the group down the tunnels, looking out for the markings of the route.

Cirrus tries his hand at some tracking, crawling on the ground, thinking that being closer to any tracks might help.  It does not.

What it does do though, is let him feel the change in temperature in the rock.  Standing up, he mentions the rock is getting a little warmer.

Continuing on, they find out why as the tunnels begin to get warmer and damper. Steam.

The group heads into a section of tunnels filled with warm water vapor. They get the occasional whiff of sulfur but it appears that the Steam Vents here are non-toxic.

They push on and the steam becomes so thick that they can only see thirty feet ahead.

Getting to a larger cavern as the tunnel widens, the group slows. 

Cirrus' sight is unobstructed and notes the cavern is empty save for two large corpses.

As they approach, the group takes note of the bizarre bodies: Massive and fishlike humanoids, the bodies shredded but with little to no blood around on the wet stone.

As the group looks on tentatively, Fey looks up noting a light and sees a strange form. 

A small glowing Jelly-fish like creature casting off a soft yellow glow comes out of the mist and floats down toward the bodies.  It enters one, seeming to simply meld with it.

Moments later, the massive body twitches and begins to move...
