The group is tired and the subterranean ruins of this place seem as good as any to take a rest.

Cirrus, Buumi and Feanon begin to set up camp while Tark, Patches and JmJm head up the ancient stairs to scout the ruins above (and make sure its safe).

The scouts ascend hundreds of feet before finding themselves at an overgrown set of crystal bars leading to a large entry-chamber.

They are blocked from going farther, but see sunlight streaming in from an open archway.

Tark and Patches teleport through, leaving JmJm at the bars

Beyond the foyer archway, they can see Thueba Swamp and a massive stone structure.

In the overgrown foyer itself, they see two figures

One seems to be a man of average height with a powerful build, but his skin is seemingly made of shining silver.

The other is an exceedingly tall and athletic woman wearing tribal furs who shimmers and disappears from view.

The scouts make contact with the strangers, though JmJm takes a rock to the face from the Silver man (who was surprised)

They apologize for the intrusion and after some talking, determine that these two strangers have no memories before the last few days and decide to take them back to the camp

They return to camp with the strangers

Back at camp, Feanon sees Vecna watching them, and moves over to Cirrus to take advantage of his non-detection

Buumi cooks for everyone including Cirrus (who finally likes something he has made)

The group talks about the newcomers and decide they have likely escaped from the nearby machina factory as some kind of experiment.

They have no idea if they are *safe* but decide to watch them but otherwise treat them as they would anyone else.

They rest safely that night and awake the next day intent on investigating the Machina factory nearby.

They leave the subterranean ruins, ascending the stairs and exiting through the overgrown foyer.

Before them, they see a grand edifice sinking into the mire of the swamp - a once magnificent saurian structure

They move in, noting the extreme corruption around the place, as well as the recent signs of movement and wreckage.

They move in cautiously and see the remains of many vats and holding tanks.

Feanon notes their similarities to Cloning vats, but thinks they may be for Stasis.

The newcomers say they recognize the tanks, they were recently in some themselves until a storm shattered them, and they fled into the nearby ruins.

They find an intact vat, within which slumbers a mutated Shadowfell creature, one they well know the hostility of.

They see the number of other broken vats and decide not to linger in the open.

They do not disturb the creature and move their attention to the main door to the Machina factory, a grand metal door, untouched by the corruption all around. 

The Silver man moves in and opens the door with considerable effort, but it opens on oiled hinges

The group moves in quickly to get through the door and out of the corruption, but the moment the door swings open, something moves within the chamber and a hurricane of Firelance shots erupts from within

The group rushes in, through the choke point and out of the corruption and they see a weapon setup in a statue, twenty feet from the ground overlooking the chamber.

The gatling Firelance turret spews forth an unending stream of fire, but the group notes a gunner behind it.  As they do, the foyer becomes obscured by a choking, burning fog.

Tark and the Silver man manage to get to the turret and toss the creature from the gunners seat

They recognize a Mezzoloth Fiend, but the Silver man crushes its head as it falls to the ground, killing it.

Annoyed at losing a prisoner to talk to, but not sweating it too much, the group enters the foyer of the Machina factory and shuts the door enough to be secure.

They take stock of their options.

The two newcomers still cannot remember much about their time here, only that something was done to them, and their chests hurt from exerting themselves in battle…

As they are deciding where to go, Patches scouts a nearby tunnel, spotting a chamber ahead, but when she returns to tell the group, she is attacked by a blast of concussive force and knocked to the ground.

There was *something *that attacked her from the tunnel, but she couldn't see it.

The group moves forward cautiously, finding a derelict room at the other end of a short hallway

Inside the room is a sparse webbing of corruption and concerningly they find two Alghoul eggs.

As they move in to destroy the eggs, the mother Alghoul reveals itself from hiding and attacks the group

It looks *wrong *compared to other Alghouls they have seen, this one having Machina and metal twisted into its physique and it seems able to let loose concussive blasts of force (the thing that attacked Patches).

Feanon disintegrates its legs as the others focus on smashing the eggs, but the beast is strong and not easily slain.

With the threat of the eggs gone, the group rallies and turns to focus all their efforts on destroying the Alghoul abomination!
