Patches meditates and prays over Cercei, then catches up with the group.  

While praying, she asks Elistraee to help Cercei overcome her evil Draconic heritage.

The group heads to Over the Moon and they discuss what to do, Cirrus and Tark discussing about sending the artifact to Selune.

Mr Pickles spies on the group from the walls...

Lilly serves everyone to the best of her ability.

Snorbul is having a hard time processing...everything.

Cirrus heads to the Fane, the place now under permanent twilight and the surrounding area. 

He heads into the central chamber of the cathedral and enters the pedestal of the statue, taking the internal elevator up to the secret shrine within.

Cirrus pitches Selune taking the artifact, but after communing with her in his shrine, he determines that it would not be as safe with her, as with Bahamut.

Fey pitches storing the artifact in his tower...there are no takers.

Tark and Cirrus discuss how to find Moot and what they decide on is contacting the one Gold Dragon they know if they can't find Moot.

Patches points out that dream messengers should be held in suspicion, pointedly mentioning this to Tark.

Cirrus tells Patches that Tark has been through enough, but its too late and Tark flees the tavern heading for his treehouse.

Patches rushes to follow, apologizing, but gets no response and she returns to her tavern, kicking herself for her choice of words.

Snorbul suggests they head to Gravenhollow, the place of answers.

Tark heads from his treehouse over to the Grove to see Doc.

Doc welcomes his friend and offers his help.

He tries to scry on Moot/Bahamut, but the entity is not on the same plane and thus, the spell does not work.

Tark has Doc communicate with Aurinax instead and though the scrying is blocked, Aurinax responds with a sending.

A stressful few sendings later and Doc has successfully relayed everything to Aurinax.

Aurinax will come in two days to pick up the artifact and take it to Protanther, King of the Gold Dragons (who resides in the **Great Glacier**).

The group is reminded of their history with Veygar, they decide to go and rescue Velka and Veygar.

The group decides if they are going back to the Underdark, the Artifact should not go with them and they will re-deposit it in Sundabar.

Depositing and retrieving the artifact is an issue though.

Fey will place another Arcane Recall on the artifact, but needs 1,000gp of Sapphires for the spell which he does not have.

Patches checks her pouch and pulls out 180gp of Sapphires.

needing more, the group approaches the Dwarves at Over the Moon and ask about their finds - 530gp of Sapphires.

The Dwarves ask to settle and mine the Red Hill and put the Sapphires down as payment to get the ball rolling on mining rights for the Hill.

Gundren writes them a receipt for settling rights.

Patches approaches Veygar in Over the Moon, who is sitting with Belairforos. The Surface Dwarves giving them both some space.

Patches strong-arms Veygar to come with the group to rescue Hemeth and Velka from Gracksuluth.

He protests until he's shoved to the ground and agrees to go with the group.

Gundren gives Patches lip, and is cursed at by the Drow. 

Patches has a heart to heart with Mr. Pickles.

Snorbul and Belairforos hire **Peb** and his Dwarven crew to go Sapphire hunting with them for reagents for Fey to recall the artifact.

Heading out with the Dwarves, Snorbul finds a good spot in the woods (along the path to the Fane) where the earth is thin and tunnels down.

finding tunnels, they then take to them and head north, beneath the lake itself.

They come across Kobolds and arrows begin to fly, the dwarves firing back with crossbows.

Snorbul and Belairforos sneak to flank the Kobolds, naked (the Svirfneblin thing...)

In position a few minutes later, Snorbul attacks, felling 8 in a flurry of blows, the others fleeing in terror.

Moments later, the Dwarves arrive and congratulate Snorbul, just as Belairforos comes down the opposite tunnels covered in blood, proclaiming the Kobolds won't bother anyone again...

Snorbul returns to Fey, handing him the rest of the sapphires they need.

Cirrus then has Veygar contact Velka via dreaming.

Veygar returns from the dreaming and has the information the group is looking for.

The group decide to send Velka a "breakout" box of goodies via Instant Courier just before the breakout attempt so that her and Hemeth can help themselves.

Hemeth and Velka are being moved in the morning from the Palace district to The Overlake Hold.  They will cross Laduagers Furrow at 10:30 am under minimal guard in armored wagon.

Velka is now expecting supplies and a way to break out.

Tark spends the night at his treehouse, training in the woods until he is exhausted.

After her heart to heart with Mr. Pickles, Patches heads out to the Dojo to look for her friend.

She calls out for her friend, but **Jin** the illusionist painter responds.

being awoken, he opens a door in the Dojo and greets Patches.

Patches is startled that he's here and interrogates him, confirming his identity as a retainer for Tark.

The painter is sufficiently intimidated and Patches puts her weapons away.  She laughs at him for trying to do something materialistic for Tark such as paint.

He explains it as giving knowledge and art to the masses and she understands that idea.

She leaves Jin to sleep and goes to train in the Dojo under the moonlight.

After a few hours and with Tark not appearing, she returns to her rooms in Over the Moon.

Fey'Anon approaches the Dojo later that evening.

Knocking on the dojo entrance, Jin is once again woken up.

Fey asks the Illusionist if he can copy his spellbook.  Jin refuses.

Fey puts the man to sleep and then rifles through his book easily breaking the cipher, copying the spells Phantasmal Force and Major Image.

He then leaves, returning to his own tower and leaving Jin asleep until someone wakes him (or Fey releases him).

Cirrus checks the "butt" of his statue...there's nothing there, Fey was joking with him about a storage room for all the items "given" to Selune.

Meanwhile, Tark dreams of warm smiles, friendly faces and a welcoming, comforting space made of wood. A well worn cabin?  An old, old memory. One of comfort and warmth.

Tark awakes in the morning, and for the first time in a long time, is refreshed and meets with the group at Over the Moon.

The group preps the box of goods to send Velka and includes everything from newly forged Thieves tools, to a satchel charge with instructions.

They prep to send it twenty minutes before the convoy goes over the bridge.

Tark wants Buumi to stay behind and protect the Last Word.

They discuss and it turns out Buumi is not needed to protect it as they can send the artifact to Sundabar safely.

Fey casts the Arcane recall, taking the fused Sapphires from the spell and placing it in the Iron Tome.  He then takes the depositing wand and puts the artifact in the bank.

The group teleports to Bilrigger's Sanctum with Buumi and then works their way up into the city.

The whole Underdark feels wrong, and now knowing about the presence of the Demon Lords, the abyssal corruption of the place is almost palpable.

The Derro halls are deserted and the Hall of Sacred Scrolls is not as busy as before

The group watches as different groups of scribes search for specific contracts and then rush away with them.

They take an elevator to the "ground" level and exit the Hall of Sacred Scrolls

the normal hustle and bustle of the city is severely repressed, as they look across the Furrow District, many patrols and devils can be seen.

Civilians that are out on the street are moving hurridly and the anxiety is palpable.

In the background, a steady bass beat can be felt as much as heard, like the pounding of distant artillery guns.

Veygar moves the group to a nearby alleyway.

Buumi is astounded by the city, and the smell makes him cough and his eyes water beneath the Three-Faced Helm.

Patches pulls out her spyglass in the alley and looks across the bridges of the Furrow, spotting the one detailed to her by Veygar's communication with Velka.

The massive construction is easily 50ft wide and hundreds of feel long, spanning the monstrous, fume-belching chasm that is Ladueger's Furrow.

Looking at the bridge, she sees numerous guards and patrols...pulling back, leaving an opening...
