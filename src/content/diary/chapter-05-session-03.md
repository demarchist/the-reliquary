## The Priest's Son

The group entered the graveyard through a small side gate and chased off a pack of ghouls feasting on a newly interred body. They laid the Burgomaster's coffin in the fresh grave dug by Fëanon's magic and summoned the priest, Donavich, from the church. The old man conducted a brief ceremony and the body was laid to rest.

A scream from inside the church shattered the moment. Donavich's face went pale. Under pressure from the group, the trembling priest confessed: his son, turned into a vampire spawn during Mordenkainen's failed assault on the castle, was locked in the church basement. The shoes, clothes, and gnawed bones scattered across the cellar floor told the rest of the story — Donavich had been feeding townsfolk to his child.

Cyrrus marched upstairs, grabbed the priest by the collar, and threw him down to his son. The group withdrew their light and let the vampire feed. Now lucid from the fresh blood, the spawn spoke with them briefly, confirming he was a thrall of Strahd. He said the wrong thing and lunged at Patches, who shoved a light grenade into his face. The group drove him back to his coffin and staked him. The vampire dust was collected for alchemy.

Buumi dragged the corrupted priest's remains into the graveyard and tossed them into an open grave. Ireena and young Chekov stood in horrified silence, the boy turning violently sick. After a brief explanation that satisfied no one, Ireena told the group she would meet them at the edge of town in the morning and took her leave.

## Mary's Daughter and the Meenlocks

The group headed for the local inn but was drawn off course by sobbing from a nearby building. Next to the general store — where they did some quick shopping — they found a woman named Mary weeping over a doll in such hysterics that something clearly was not right.

Investigation revealed four Meenlocks lurking in the building. Cyrrus reacted badly — the tooth-fairy minions of his patron had all been Meenlocks, and the sight brought on a full panic attack. Patches and the others talked him through it, and Cyrrus agreed to face his fears. With Patches covering the windows, the group stormed the room. Two Meenlocks fled; two died. Cyrrus felt measurably better for having confronted the source of his terror.

Mary, no longer incoherent, explained that her teenage daughter Gertruda had escaped from the house a few days ago. Mary had been imprisoning the girl out of suffocating fear that something terrible would happen to her. The group noted the doll's tag: *"Is no fun!? Is NO Blinsky!"*

## Madame Eva

At the inn, over a much-needed meal, Cyrrus delivered an impassioned speech about staying neutral and finding a way out of Barovia without getting slaughtered. The Vistani patrons agreed that Strahd was misunderstood and pointed out several locations on the group's map. Rumours reached them of an ancient temple on the slopes of Mt. Ghakis built to imprison dark powers, a hoard belonging to a silver dragon, and the camp of the Vistani fortune-teller Madame Eva.

The night brought restless sleep — nightmares and distant howling. Patches woke to find a note nailed to her door. Over breakfast, she showed it to the group: a message from Gowain, promising to hunt them down and retrieve his hat.

The group set out the next morning, meeting a fully armed Ireena at the town's edge. She presented Buumi with an enchanted lance, noting he had no mounted weaponry. Their destination was the camp of Madame Eva at the Tser Pool, with Vallaki beyond.

At the bridge over the Ivlis River, they discovered a troll sleeping underneath. Ireena sighed — the patrol that should have cleared it out was now dead by the group's own hand from the previous day's battle. Using stealth and fire, they immolated the troll and its nest while it slept. The blazing creature leapt into the river and was borne away in the strong current.

An hour of riding through dark forest brought them to a large clearing at the foot of Mt. Ghakis. The crossroads held a set of gallows and twelve graves behind a low stone wall. Against the wall sat a revenant in ancient silver dragon armour — rusted and brittle, but clutching a gleaming greatsword. The undead knight implored them to visit Argynvostholt and speak with the Grandmaster of the Silver Dragons, then returned to its silent vigil.

Taking the Low Road to avoid Gowain, they descended through the trees to the shores of the Tser Pool. Madame Eva's camp was a ring of five colourful wagons with tents dotting the perimeter. Guards waved them in. On the way, they overheard a Vistani recounting how Mordenkainen had fought Strahd above the nearby waterfall, fallen over the edge, and vanished — his body never found in the pool below.

Patches did some light stealing — force of habit — and the group assembled at Madame Eva's tent. The old fortune-teller laid her cards and spoke plainly. The only ways out of Barovia were to kill Strahd, proving themselves stronger, or to bring the vampire lord to forgive himself for what had happened here. She revealed that something they needed was hidden in her own camp, that Strahd would confront them in the Hall of Bones, that an artifact of great power lay in the tomb of Sergei — Strahd's brother — and that another waited where the silver dragon had lived as a man. An ally could be found in the largest Vistani camp near Vallaki.

The group searched the camp and found the Journal of Strahd tucked inside one of the colourful carts. Standing between the bonfire and Eva's tent, they weighed their options. The old woman's last words lingered in the cold air: Strahd could be saved. They could all be saved. If only he could somehow find it in himself to forgive.
