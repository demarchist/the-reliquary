The group entered the graveyard through a small side gate.  They chase off some Ghouls, feasting on a newly interred body and lay the coffin of the Burgomaster in the new grave, dug for him by magic.   A few moments later, summoned by another Unseen Servant and Mr. Pickles, the priest, Donavich exits the church.  He finds out from the group what transpired and agrees to bury the Burgomaster.  After a brief ceremony, the body is interred.  Just then, a scream is heard from within the Church and Donavich gets nervous.  As he tries to sneak back inside, the group catches him and forces him to tell them about his Vampire Spawn son he has locked in the basement.   Not wanting to get involved with the large group of formidable adventurers, Ireena stays outside the church with the Squire Chekhov.

Inside, the group is led through the dilapidated church to a small dusty room, with a single trapdoor in the corner. Buumi wrenches it open and heads down into the cellar, hammer and armor emitting light.  The group follows Buumi, down into the dark.  With several light spells and gadgets, the group sees the feral vampire in the back corner, trying to keep away from the light.

The group also notices the remains (shoes, clothes, bones) of several people; the Priest has been feeding his son.  Cirrus marches upstairs and grabs the priest, as the rest of the group watches, the priest is thrown to the vampire and the light is withdrawn.  The Vampire makes short work of his father and, now lucid, converses with the group.  They discover that he is a thrall of Strahd and was taken in the assault on Strahd's castle, led there by the mage Mordenkainen.  Saying the wrong thing, the Vampire leaps at Patches, attacking her but gets a light grenade in it's face.  The group then lays into him, forcing him back to his coffin where he is staked.  The Vampire dust is collected, for alchemy… and the group heads back to the graveyard, with Buumi hauling out the remains of the corrupted priest and throwing it in an open grave.  Ireena and the Squire are horrified, with the little lad being violently sick.  After a quick explaination, Ireena sighs and tells them she will meet them the next morning at the edge of town and bids them goodnight.

The group heads to the local inn to rest, but get distracted as they approach, by some wailing and sobbing coming from a nearby building.  Noticing the sobbing is occurring next to the general store, they do some shopping and then investigate the house with the crying.  They discover a woman inside, sobbing over a doll in such hysterics that the group is made suspicious.  After some investigation, they sense the presence of several Meenlocks, which Cirrus reacts negatively to.  Having a panic attack, Cirrus is ultimately convinced to face his fears (toothfairy minions were all meenlocks).  With Patches covering the windows, the group storms the room.  The four Meenlocks try to flee, with two making it away, and two others dying to the group.  Cirrus feels much better having faced his fears.  The woman, still sad, but no longer incoherent explains that her daughter - Gertruda, left home a few days ago, escaping the house.  Mary, the mother, had been imprisoning her teenage daughter as she was so frightened something would happen to her.  The group notices the doll Mary holds has a tag that reads "Is no fun!? Is NO Blinsky!".

The group heads to the Inn for some much needed shuteye.  Before heading to bed, they get a meal and drinks and chat with the Vistani inside.  Cirrus delivers an impassioned speech to the group on staying neutral and/or getting out of this plane without being slaughtered and how they should be VERY careful.  The Vistani agree with Cirrus, that Strahd is misunderstood and take a look at the map for the group when asked about any interesting areas.  They hear rumors about the following:

An ancient temple, built on the south slope of Mt. Ghakis, to imprison The Dark Powers

Hoard of the Silver Dragon

Madame Eva's camp

The group sleeps for the night, suffering nightmares and being awoken by distant howling.  Patches is awakened and notices a note nailed to her door.

The next morning at breakfast, she shows the group a note from Gowain.  It tells the group that he WILL hunt them down and retrieve his hat.

The group heads out of town, meeting Ireena - fully armed and armored for battle, she gives Buumi a +1 Lance, noting he has no mounted weaponry.  The group begins their trek to Vallakai, with the intent of stopping off and seeing Madame Eva at her camp.

Arriving at the bridge crossing the Ivlis river, the group notices something is off.  After some quick scouting, they discover a troll sleeping under the bridge.  Ireena laments that the patrol (now dead by the groups hand…) should have cleared that Troll out.

Using stealth and subterfuge, the group immolates the Troll and it's nest as it sleeps.  Suddenly engulfed in the flames, the Troll leaps into the river, only to be borne away downstream in the strong current.  The group searches the burning Troll nest, braving the horrid stench but finding nothing and continue across the bridge.

After an hour of riding through the dark forest, Cirrus sends his owl up to scout on ahead.  As the Owl strays ever so slightly off into the woods, a huge boulder narrowly missed the Owl, thrown by something Unseen. The group goes on alert but sees nothing.  Ireena mentions The Genoskwa, a dark beast that lives in the woods, that likes to twist the heads off it's victims and drink their blood.  The group continues on without incident, reaching a crossroads in a large clearing at the foot of Mt. Ghakis, it's slopes rising high above into the dark roiling clouds.

They look around the crossroads, noting the gallows and 12 graves situated behind a low stone wall.  Against the wall, they see a seated Revenant, wearing ancient silver Dragon armor, now rusted and brittle but clutching a gleaming greatsword.  They talk with the Revenant, it implores them to go to Argynvolstold and talk with The Grandmaster of the Silver Dragons.  The Revenant then returns to his seat at the foot of the wall.  

Deciding to avoid Gowain for now, the group takes the Low Road, into the forest and to the shores of the Tser Pool, to meet Madame Eva.  As the group exits the trees, they see a colorful Vistani camp, 5 colorful wagons in a ring with a few tents dotting the area.  Many Vistani are reveling, though three look to be on active guard, they wave the group over. Explaining their intent to see Madame Eva, they are welcomed.  On the way in, they overhear one of the Vistani relay the battle between Strahd and Mordenkainen, that the mage fought strahd above the waterfall nearby, fell over the edge but was nowhere to be found in the pool below.

  Patches does some light stealing, finding some valuables and rejoins the group at Madame Eva's tent.  There, they meet the old fortune teller of the Vistani.  She tells the group that the only way out is to Kill Strahd, proving they are stronger, or getting him to forgive himself for what happened here.

They discover several more useful things:

Something they need is in the camp - Madame Eva lets them look for it.

Strahd will confront them in the Hall of Bones

An artifact of great power is in the tomb of Sergei - Strahds brother

Another artifact is located where the Silver Dragon lived as a man.

They will find an ally in the largest camp of her People in the Valley - near Vallaki

The group thanks Madame Eva and searches the camp, finding the Journal of Strahd in one of the colorful carts - though they know not whose cart it is.

The group discusses what to do next as they stand between the Vistani bonfire and Eva's tent.  Eva relays to them again that he can be saved, they can all be saved, if he can somehow forgive himself.
