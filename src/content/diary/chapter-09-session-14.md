The group heads into the downstairs rooms at the Foaming Mug Tavern in Blingdenstone.

Feanon wastes little time and quickly summons his Magnificent Manor.

The group all head inside, save for Tark and enjoy the magnificent comfort of the extra-planar sanctum.

Tark meanwhile, sleeps outside the door, guarding it for his friends.

In a comfortable bed, Tark dreams dark dreams, the ambient demonic magic of the Underdark causing terrible nightmares.

The cloying, dripping and burning darkness of the nightmares are suddenly washed away by a bright warmth and Tark feels overcome with the sense of calmness and warmth.

He awakes the next morning, refreshed by the wonderful dream and he tries to recall details.

He was staring up at a ceiling, as if lying in a bed, he saw firelight and a strange refraction playing across the inside of a wooden structure, the architecture flowing and natural, simple but well crafted.

He remembers two halflings, much larger than he, leaning over with smiling faces and a warmth of comfort and love.

His parents, one of the only memories of them.

Tark smiles, reflecting on the happy memory and remembering the beautiful play of refracted light across the ceiling of his childhood bedroom.

Tark heads to the common room of the tavern, with the group not far behind.

They see a communal breakfast being served in the tavern, a line of Svirfneblin going out the door (but moving fast).

They grab bowls and get in line for a fine breakfast.

As they eat, Gruttag swings by to have Snorbul talk with the chieftens, Thorns joins them.

After eating, the others all head over to the craftsman hall to meet Jinu and be shown the secret way into the Rockblight.

Cirrus, nursing a terrible hangover, elects to remain behind to prostletize the virtues of the Moon to the Deep Folk.

The group enters the Craftsman hall and sees the impressive operation the Gnome settlement has going on; with many dozens of gem cutters and jewelers practicing their craft.

Indeed, along one side of the large cavern is a long table, maybe 150ft with uncut gemstones filling a trough in the center.

Along the table, dozens of Deep Gnomes with eyepieces and cutting tools go about cutting the many thousands of gems.

Patches practically drools and inches over to investigate the riches.

The rest of the group collects Jinu, getting the blessing from her master to go find Trisk.

As they turn to go, they notice that Patches has somehow gotten embroiled in a Gem cutting competition to get the Deep Gnomes to respect her.

She masterfully cuts the Diamond they received as payment from the Deep Gnomes earlier, into a masterpiece.

The Gnomes are awed at the precision and they begin to whisper about the Moon-touched Drow, Chosen of Elistraee.

Patches covertly touches dozens of Gemstones as she takes her leave, draining many and refilling the power of Eclipse.

She catches up with the group as they head north, toward Rockblight.

Moving past the checkpoint, Jinu leads the group to a smooth section of wall and taps on it.

A small tunnel appears as the elemental shifts the stone of the wall.

The group prepares to crawl through, but an approaching Svirfneblin catches their attention; Gurnik, the Cleric.

He thanks the group for heading into the Rockblight and asks if they do, to keep an eye out for a massive standing stone, it intrigues him and he wishes to learn more about it.

The group agrees, and head through to the Rockblight caverns.


On the other side, the group finds themselves in a large hallway, stairs ascending behind them to a collapse, to their right, the staris descend and open into a chamber.

Patches and Tark head south with all the stealth they can muster and investigate the chamber.

Tark enacts pass without trace.

Patches accidentally slips back into the Ethereal plane and notes a flicker of red lightning up ahead before returning to the material plane.

They see an Elemental pounding on a door and notice a glowing mass of fire beetles swarming over one wall of the chamber, lighting it in a warm glow.

As they go to retreat to the group, they notice a large pool of liquid.

Tark sticks his head near it, getting very close to the water, but pulls back as small tendrils raise from the liquid, searching.

Below the water is a massive Grey ooze.

The group backs off, intent to investigate the cave in and see if they could shift the rubble.

They head up the stairs to the collapse and Gundren gets to work investigating.

He determines that with certain blocks moved, they can get through the rubble.

Gundren sets up a pulley system with Gwen as the mechanism and gets to work.

It takes twenty minutes, but he manages to shift a large enough stone to create a passthrough.

As he lifts though, a large chunk of stone falls with a boom, creating a loud disturbance. Though muffled by the Pass Without Trace

The group squeezes on through and notice a Black pudding heading along the ceiling toward them, toward the disturbance.

They back up and lay a trap, springing it as the pudding squeezes through the opening in the rubble.

They blast the creature into sludge and then move past it, back into the newly opened hallway.

The hallway raises at a slight slope, opening into another large chamber, on the ramp ahead though is a half dissolved were-rat.

It appears to be recently dead and devoured by the Black Pudding.

The group pushes on cautiously and approaches a large cavern, the area covered in glowing crystal growths.

The large cavern consists of a large bridge spanning it, with buildings built into the floors and walls of the place.

The Crystal Garden glows, but movement catches the groups eye and they stop to investigate.

The notice a small pack of Dust mephits flitting about the crystals as well as two Cockatrice sniffing around the feet of a petrified Deep Gnome.

The group attacks and destroys the two Cocaktrice quickly and the Mephits back away cautiously.

Feanon speaks to them in Primordial though and hears that the Mephits are afraid of the Medusa in the area that turns people to stone; people like the Deep Gome here.

Looking over the Gnome, the group determines that he’s been there for many years, possibly decades, but decide to take him back to Cirrus to be Restored.

They finagle the statue into a bag of holding.

Looking around the chamber more, across the bridge they note a veritable army of Drow soldier statues, their ranks disappearing into the darkness of the Caverns.

Below the rocky bridge, the group hears the growling and snarling of wild animals engaged in some kind of battle.

North though, Gundren spots the Standing Stone Gurnik asked them to investigate.

Gundren approaches and notes the shrine-like aspects of the stone, complete with receptacles for gemstones.

It is a holy site, though currently desecrated.

Wondering if the nearby crystals could be slotted into the Obelisk, Gundren goes to crack a small piece off a nearby formation.

As he strikes the crysta, a flicker of red lightningl, and earth arm erupts from the ground draggin Gundren down into the liquid-like stone.

The group rushes forward and they quickly rope Gundren off to stop him sinking.

The elemental pulls on the Dwarf and Tark has to smash the arm of the Elemental with his staff before it lets go.

The Dwarf pulls himself from the liquid stone and moments later it re-solidifies.

Patches moves to touch the Obelisk and is shocked by red lightning.

Looking around the desecrated holy site, the group begins to see flickers of red lightning.

They decide to return and tell Gurnik.

Returning to Blingdenstone proper, the group approaches Gurnik’s shrine and fetch Cirrus.

The priest of Callarduran gives Cirrus Diamond dust and speaking thanks to the moon, Cirrus restores the petrified Deep Gnome.

The man gasps and Gurnik welcomes his old friend back to the land of the living, indeed, the Gnome has been missing for twenty years and presumed long dead.

An acolyte leads the un-petrified man away and nearby Deep Gnomes begin to whisper in awe, many smiles being turned toward the group.

They then talk to Gurnik about the Obelisk.

He hands to them a Spell Ruby containing the Hallow spell and asks them to slot it into the Obelisk.

Gurnik is sure it will cleanse the area of the Curse, of the “Bane”.

He tells the group that The Bane won’t let them simply cleanse the area, expect a fight of some kind.

The group asks for Earth Elementals to assist them then but Gurnik informs them that The Bane got it’s name for it’s effect on earth Elementals.

The Bane will drive any Elemental insane with rage, so they dare not push into Rockblight with their most powerful servants unavailable.

The group mulls it over and decides to play it by ear; to place the Hallow Gemstone and potentially have Feanon teleport Elementals to the Holy Site after the Bane is dealt with.

Gurnik tentatively agrees and goes to inform his acolytes - they have new Elementals to summon for battle…
