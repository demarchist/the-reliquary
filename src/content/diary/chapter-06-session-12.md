**Patches**

Patches has climbs up onto a rooftop and looks down upon the snow covered trees and buildings, she does not see anyone following her.

Patches pulls out the letter she was given and breaks the seal. Reading through it she receives some information and decides to head to The Golden Oak Tavern, a favorite of druids and rangers.

The large Inn is suspended high in the branches of a massive tree, in the middle of the "Elf Quarter" the section of the city the fairfolk frequent the most.  

On the way in, many elf children and families were seen enjoying the Solstice.

Patches ascends the rope bridge to the boughs and heads into the Inn.

Inside, Patches heads to the bar - tended by a huge Bear-Man named Avery.

Patches spots Tibbets and two other skinny cloaked figures sitting at a corner table.  

She spots them right away and after a few minutes of not trying to hide, they spot her too and visibly panic a little.

Eventually, Tibbets attempts to regain his composure and beckons Patches over. 

As she does so, Avery gives them their drinks and asks how "Your mother, Mrs. Goldtoe is doing" to Tibbets.

The awkward teenagers desperately try to come off as cool when Patches sits down, but they radiate unease and awkwardness.

Tibbets drops the name of Lo'Dan and Patches sighs, realizing she's been sent to meet with this "crew"

She proceeds to ask questions to the group and gets confirmation of a "foreign" group of soldiers operating in the city: The Ironarm Mercenary Company.  

Tibbets, "Link" and "Chaunce" proceed to give out the information they've been instructed to give Patches, seemingly for nothing more than "cred".

Chaunce is the son of Von Issinger, the Silverymoon Master of Coin who approved the contract for The Ironarms.

The Ironarms got contracts to bring in 500 soldiers to patrol the city, sewers and a specific section of the wall that is undergoing repairs.

Patches finds out that Von Issinger filed the contracts in his office in the Silverymoon Palace.  

She would need to go to the office to confirm who is paying the mercenary company, but she strongly suspects Amn...

The last of Tibbets friends to speak up; Link, finally opens her mouth and reveals herself to be a student at one of the Mage colleges and three days ago she saw an Amnian Archmage and his apprentice enter the city.  

She could'nt get a good look at the Archmage, but his solid gold staff was a bit of a give away - Shaahir of Athkatla.  She describes the apprentice and unknown to Patches, describes Cirrus' brother S'Olaa.

Looking around at the bar, Patches notes that a handful of nearby patrons are glancing over, hearing Tibbets less than quiet whispering.

Patches leans in, pulling out a dagger and warns the kids that the game they are playing in right now is deadly and that the information they gave could result in deaths.

The evesdropping patrons all go back to their drinks, a little scared and Patches slams her knife down into the table to make her point.

Tibbets and his crew hightale it out of The Golden Oak.

Patches looks around the bar, finishes her drink and then heads out herself.

Patches Rockie-talkies in to the group, asking where they are and heads out to meet them at Sejuk's estate.

On the way, she spots a Female Moon elf handing out wreaths from a horse drawn sleigh.

Glancing over the scene, Patches realizes that she recognizes the Elf: Menriel Boughrunner, a Ranger of the Moonwood.

Patches waits for the Wreath buyers to disperse and catches the Moon-Elf's attention.

The elf notices and heads toward Patches, stopping a respectful distance away before questioning the presence of the Rogue.

Menriel admonishes Patches for being entirely absent from "his" life for the last twenty years and treats her with a dismissive attitude.

Menriel mentions that "he" is learning much and doing very well.

Patches feels shame and Menriel leaves with a parting question, asking if "she will at least visit as she's so close?"

Patches watches Menriel leave before turning and hurrying through the dark, snow covered streets of the beautiful tree covered city, toward the rest of the group...

**Everyone Else**

Tark and Fey wait with baited breath as the original guard knocks on the Manor door. A few moments later, it opens.

An immaculately clean and well groomed Dwarven butler named Vernon answers the door and receives a quick explanation from the city guard.

Tark butts in and shakes the bag of holding, exclaiming about the lich and Vernon dismisses the little halfling with a glance.  His eyes move on to Fey'Anon and go wide with recognition.

Fey greets Vernon, who he has not seen in decades and the two are let in the house, Vernon leading them to the sitting room to wait for Sejuk.

They find out that Sejuk is enjoying a post-meal nap and is to awaken in 30 minutes.  Feeling pressed for time, Fey and Tark persuade Vernon to go and wake Sejuk immediately.

Meanwhile back at the Lady's College, Cirrus bamfs into the Quad and looks around the snow dusted park.  He quickly spots Buumi and Gundren relaxing under a tree, Buumi trying to sing and Gundren picking his nose.

They then hear from Patches via Rockietalkie that she is following up a lead, and they decide to head to Sejuks manor and after asking some guards, are directed accordingly.

Sejuk opens the door to his sitting room and greets his old friend Fay; with standoffishness and reservedness.  Until Fey responds jovially and Sejuk realizes that his old friend has been freed of his enthrallment to the Illithids.

Fey finds out that his old colleague had felt terribly guilty for not saving him that day and that he is now freed of the burden of his conscience. 

Fey reassures Sejuk and congratulates him on attaining Deanship.

At this point, Tark is veritably ready to explode and shakes the Bag of holding again. The door to the sitting room opens and Vernon shows in the rest of the group (minus Patches).

Tark pulls grabs the artifact in the bag of holding, just for a moment, and the item begins to tear at his essence.

To Tark though, all the world seems to freeze and his consciousness is whisked away across the miles.

Tark sees a barren tundra, his homeland, sandwiched between two massive mountain ranges, bridged by a huge wall at the narrowest point. Sailing over the land, incorporeal, Tark sees the Half-Orc city of Palishuk, covered in the winter snow. Flying further still, he speeds toward a massive wall of black ice; The Great Glacier and in it's face is carved a massive citadel: Castle Perilous, the citadel of Zhengyi.

Flying in through the ramparts and the main gate, down dark, glittering hallways and into a massive vaulted audience hall, Tark sees a throne of frost covered Iron.  In it's seat, a pile of ash gathers steadily.  Tark sees a flash of white and is surrounded by a swirling dreamscape of blue energy.  In this nebulous space, he sees a rune covered Iron skeleton with Opal eyes, gathering power.  Zhengyi, like Kangaxx before him, is one of Orcus' "children".  Another flash of white and Tark sees an image of the Demon Prince of Undeath himself, Orcus, sitting upon a throne of skulls.  The goat-skull headed, hulking, rotting carcass, batwinged monstrosity pushing Zhengyi back into the world through sheer divine might.

Tark snaps out of the vision and closes the bag, ducking as he does so.  Buumi sails overhead, slamming into the bookshelf, pulled there by the artifact embedded in his shield.

The group proceeds to grill Sejuk on the nature of the artifact, the spell that Theodemir and his students used to restrain Zhengyi and the power required to do so.

They quickly discover that the spell had taken many days to enact and such a thing would not be possible to replicate especially without Theodemir.

Fey remarks that he may have saved Theodemir in his ring of Mind Shielding and Sejuk is astonished.

It is still dire news however and the group is not sure that Zhengyi WONT be returning to the plane in Silverymoon.

They then wonder if the Amnians, Oni and Zhengyi are all connected with some large-scale invasion going down at midnight when Zhengyi will re-appear.

Sejuk remarks that the Amnians are being pushed back legally and the city will be dealing with them soon. 

Their movement of troops through the city ruffled many feathers and with the growing closeness between Silverymoon and the Dwarves, is the perfect excuse Silverymoon needs to give the Amnians the boot.

This seemingly confirms to the group that the Amnians are about to invade imminently to secure the city and their holdings, and remark as such to Sejuk.  

The Dean remains unconvinced.

Looking to confirm their suspicions, the group heads to the streets and splits into pairs to look for some Amnians (to capture and interrogate).

They do not find any Amnian personnel, which in itself strikes them as odd at 9:30pm on the night of the solstice festival; the city itself is still bustling with celebration.

Patches arrives back at this time and meets up with the group.  They all head inside.

Inside, Fey sits down in the study and pulls out Strahd's spellbook, content to study while the group talks over their next move.

Cirrus and Tark sit down and enact a spell of Dreaming so that Tark can contact his old master; Gabbock.

Tark sees the frail old man, still a prisoner of Zhengyi's forces.  Tark swears he will help him, somehow, and warns the old man of Zhengyi's return.

The spell ends.

As satisfied as they can be that Zhengyi is NOT appearing in Silverymoon, they inquire with Sejuk if he has any contacts in Damara that they could warn.

It's a bit of a stretch, but he believes that he may have a friend of a friend he can write to and heads upstairs to pen a letter.

The group sends Vernon out to fetch some Mulled wine and chestnuts for everyone.

**Combining the Artifact**

In the sitting room, Fey remarks that it's time they find out why the two shards of the artefact are attracted to one another.  The group agrees and Buumi pulls the shard from his shield using his prosthetic.

Buumi tosses the piece into the center of the room, on the floor.  Tark opens the bag and holds the artefact up for a mere moment.

The shard on the floor flies toward the one in Tark's hand and slams into it with a deafening roar and flash of bright white light.

The house shakes and everyone dives for cover.  

Tark is blown through a wall and embeds in another, his body smoking and covered in horrible burns.

The artifact combines in a blaze of plasma and tearing energies, arcs ripping through walls, floors and ceilings as if they are paper.

As suddenly as it started, it ends and the artifact drops to the floor with a heavy thud.  The once solid gold cube, now with a straight rectangular streak of obsidian through the center.

Fey quickly mage hands the artifact into his bag of holding.  

The group hobbles to their feet, all badly hurt.   Cirrus rushes to Tark, praying to Selune to save his friend and regenerating his wounds.

The house groans and begins to shift.

Everyone grabs their things, one another and an injured Sejuk and they rush from the fast crumbling Manor and into the snowy street where Mr. Pickles had been waiting with the mounts and Gwen.

Not a moment later, the house collapses in on itself.

Hurt, confused and exasperated, Sejuk is furious. The Dean remarks that he's done with the group and storms off to stay with family (and deal with the ramifications in the morning). 

Buumi begins a prayer of healing and Tark wraps shadows around the group as they back away from the scene of destruction, just as guards rush to the scene.

The group decides that with their wounds, they need to recover before midnight in case something is going to happen with Amn. They start for The House Invincible.

Not as hurt as the others, and thinking ahead, Patches decides that she cannot wait until morning to purchase the gemstones she needs.  She has to go tonight, now even, and acquire them herself.

Patches veers from the group, toward the market square and the nicer part of the merchant district.  She looks for the most high-class and expensive gem-store she can locate.  

The rest of the group heads through the city, passing many late-night partygoers enjoying the brisk winter evening, filled with the magic of the Solstice.  No one is on edge, in fact the mood of the city is veritably joyous.  This makes the party even more anxious.

**The Heist**

Patches circles the most valuable Gem Store she can find, scouting it and looking for defences.

At the back, she moves in for the backdoor, but stops just short of an Alarm-wire; some kind of spell.

Noting another way in, requiring some good acrobatics, Patches quickly scales a nearby tree and sprints along one of the branches, leaping off and landing on the roof.  

The branch she ran along had broken the line of the alarm spell, allowing her inside the ring.

On the roof, Patches finds a window and opens the complicated lock and then, finding another trap, disarms that too and slips into the attic.

surrounded by cloth covered furniture, Patches starts keeping an eye out for valuables and heads toward the trap door to the lower levels.

She descends from the attic into an ornate and beautiful living area above the main store.  The hallway lined with paintings and sculptures, Patches makes her way to the stairs down.

Descending the stairs, Patches makes it to the second to last step before noticing a "trap": an alarm floorboard.  She marks it and steps over it, onto the show floor.

A small, but VERY high-class store, patches sees four display cases. An Opal by the street window, a Topaz at the main counter, a Ruby by the far wall, and a massive diamond by the stairs.

Patches heads to the Topaz first, valuing it at several thousand gold. 

She inspects the case, it doesn't appear to be trapped. 

She pulls out a knife to score the the glass.

Scratching at the glass, Patches finds that her ordinary weapons cannot touch the stuff.  The display boxes are not glass cases, but Glassteel cubes...

Patches summons Eclipse and begins to use her heavily enchanted blade to cut, noisily, through the glassteel.  She makes it through relatively quickly and hunkers down, listening for any movement.

After a tense moment, she relaxes, reaches into the glassteel box (after pocketing the disc of the stuff) and touches the Topaz, stealing it's lustre.

Putting her gloves back on, she turns to the Diamond and repeats the process of breaking into the case.

This time however, when scoring the glassteel case, her weapon scrapes horribly on the material, throwing off sparks.  Patches stops suddenly, hearing movement upstairs and elderly voices swearing about intruders.  Patches leaps, running up the nearby wall and to the ceiling, holding herself up in a dark corner of the store. She watches an elderly, married couple of robed gnomes rush downstairs holding wands. 

When they don't see anyone, they begin looking around, wands at the ready.  Above, Patches pulls out a card from her deck of illusions and flicks it down to the ground behind them.

A moment later, an illusionary Troll appears in the store, roaring.  The two gnomes scream in panic and rush from the store into the street and away from the Troll.

Patches drops from the ceiling, finishes the cut on the glass, grabs the Diamond and puts it in her bag.  

She then rushes upstairs just as she sees flashes of light outside and the two Gnomes yell that "it's just an illusion! The thief is still inside!" and sprint back into their store.

Patches however, is already on the roof and rushes back to the branch that got her to the roof.  Leaping from the tree to another rooftop, and then another, and another, Patches heads off toward The House Invincible.

**The House Invincible**

Arriving at the House Invincible, the Fortress/Cathedral looming over the merchant district of the city, many clerics and priests rush to the wounded group to offer numerous minor spells of healing.  Between the groups own healing and the assistance of The Watchers, the worst of the damage is alleviated and the group heads into the Cathedral. 

Looking for Vigilant Master Thelm, the group is led through the main hall, massive vaulted archways and ceilings embedded with ornate stained glass.  The place radiates a feeling of solidity and safety.

They pass the main Altar, a huge Mithril shield embossed with a golden gauntlet and Sapphire eye, laid flat like a table and seemingly floating in midair.

Behind the altar, a set of rich wooden double doors are closed.  The acolyte leading the group knocks politely, despite hesitating at first.

A few moments later, Thelm opens the door to his chambers, clad in a rich blue Toga.  He is obviously strong despite his advanced age and long silver beard. He greets Buumi warmly and then introduces himself to the group, of which he has heard much about.

The group quickly relays the most vital parts of their current story and Thelm's happy expression turns serious.  In his chambers, he had been chatting with some friends and enjoying wine, he asks them to leave and they understandingly oblige.  The gnome and elf giving the group and Thelm the room.

Thelm asks the group to re-iterate and they begin going over what evidence they have, pointing out the Ironarms, their patrol routes, the number of "plainsclothed" soldiers flooding into the city, the Amnian interest in the artifact, Illithid, Zhengyi's midnight resurgence and the impending treaty with the Dwarves.  This all leads the group to the conclusion that Amn is moving at midnight.

Patches rejoins the group, having been led to the meeting.

Thelm is convinced that too many "coincidences" have been happening and decides to order mobilisation, to call all of his paladins and clerics to The House for midnight and to send a summons to the temple of Lathander as well....

Finally getting someone to listen to them, the group begins to plan their next move. They desperately want to rest but with Midnight only an hour and a half away, they decide to head to the city wall instead, where The Ironarms have been carrying out a contract...

it is 10:30pm.
