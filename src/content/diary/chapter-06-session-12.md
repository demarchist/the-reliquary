## The Golden Oak

Patches climbed to a rooftop and surveyed the snowy streets below. Satisfied she was not being followed, she broke the seal on the letter she had been given at the gate and read through its contents. The trail led to the Golden Oak Tavern — a favourite haunt of druids and rangers, suspended high in the branches of a massive tree in the Elf Quarter.

She ascended the rope bridge into the boughs and entered the inn. Behind the bar stood a huge bear-man named Avery. In a corner table sat Tibbets and two other skinny, cloaked figures. Patches spotted them at once and made no effort to hide. After several minutes of her staring, they spotted her too and visibly panicked.

Tibbets beckoned her over with a forced air of composure. As she sat, the trio of awkward teenagers radiated unease while desperately trying to appear cool. Tibbets dropped the name Lo'Dan and Patches sighed, realising she had been sent to meet this crew. She asked her questions and got confirmation of a foreign group of soldiers operating in the city: the Ironarm Mercenary Company. The information came freely, seemingly offered for nothing more than credibility with the legendary rogue.

Chaunce, the son of Von Issinger — the Silverymoon Master of Coin — revealed that his father had approved the contracts. The Ironarms had been brought in five hundred strong to patrol the city, the sewers and a specific section of the wall undergoing repairs. The contracts were filed in Von Issinger's office at the Silverymoon Palace. Patches strongly suspected Amn was footing the bill.

Link, the quietest of the three, finally spoke. A student at one of the mage colleges, she had seen an Amnian Archmage and his apprentice enter the city three days prior. She could not get a good look at the Archmage, but his solid gold staff was distinctive — Shaahir of Athkatla. Her description of the apprentice, unknown to Patches, matched Cyrrus's brother S'Olaa.

Patches noted nearby patrons leaning in to listen to Tibbets' less-than-quiet whispering. She leaned across the table, pulled a dagger and warned the kids that the game they were playing was deadly — that the information they had just given could get people killed. The eavesdroppers turned hastily back to their drinks. Patches slammed the knife into the table to drive the point home and Tibbets and his crew fled the Golden Oak.

On her way to meet the group, Patches spotted a female Moon Elf handing out wreaths from a horse-drawn sleigh. She recognised the elf — Menriel Boughrunner, a Ranger of the Moonwood. Patches waited for the buyers to disperse and caught the ranger's attention. Menriel stopped a respectful distance away and admonished Patches for being entirely absent from "his" life for the last twenty years, treating her with cold dismissal. She mentioned that "he" was learning much and doing well, and asked — as a parting shot — whether Patches would at least visit, being so close. Patches watched Menriel leave, feeling the weight of the question, before turning and hurrying through the dark, snow-covered streets toward the others.

## Dean Sejuk

Tark and Fëanon waited with bated breath as the city guard knocked on the manor door. An immaculately groomed Dwarven butler named Vernon answered. Tark butted in immediately, shaking the bag of holding and exclaiming about the lich. Vernon dismissed the halfling with a glance — but his eyes went wide when they settled on Fëanon.

Fëanon greeted Vernon, whom he had not seen in decades, and the two were let inside. Sejuk was enjoying a post-meal nap and would be awake in thirty minutes. The group persuaded Vernon to wake him immediately.

The Dean entered his sitting room and greeted his old friend with the same stiff guardedness that had always characterised their relationship — until Fëanon responded with warmth and Sejuk realised his colleague had been freed from the Illithid enthrallment. Years of guilt melted away. Back at the Lady's College, Cyrrus bamfed into the quad and found Buumi trying to sing under a tree while Gundren picked his nose. They heard from Patches via rockie talkie that she was following a lead and decided to head to the manor, arriving shortly after.

Tark could contain himself no longer. He grabbed the artefact in the bag for a moment and the world froze. His consciousness hurtled across the miles — over the barren tundra of his homeland, past the Half-Orc city of Palishuk in its winter snow, toward the Great Glacier. In its face was carved Castle Perilous, the citadel of Zhengyi. Through dark, glittering hallways and into a vaulted audience hall, Tark saw a throne of frost-covered iron. In its seat, ash gathered steadily. A flash of white and he saw a rune-covered iron skeleton with opal eyes — Zhengyi, like Kangaxx before him, one of Orcus' children. Another flash and Orcus himself sat upon a throne of skulls, the goat-skulled, bat-winged monstrosity pushing Zhengyi back into the world through sheer divine might.

Tark snapped out of the vision and ducked. Buumi sailed overhead, wrenched toward the bag by the artefact fragment embedded in his shield, and slammed into the bookshelf.

The group grilled Sejuk on the nature of the artefact and the spell Theodemir had used. They quickly learned that the original enchantment had taken many days to enact and could not be replicated — especially without Theodemir. Fëanon mentioned he might have saved his master's spirit in his ring of mind shielding. Sejuk was astonished. It was still dire news. The group debated whether Zhengyi would arrive in Silverymoon itself and whether the Amnians, the Oni and the Lich were all connected — part of some coordinated midnight strike. Sejuk remarked that the Amnians were being pushed back legally and that the growing alliance with the dwarves gave Silverymoon the excuse it needed to expel them. This only confirmed the group's suspicion that the Amnians would move before they could be ejected.

They took to the streets in pairs to find Amnian soldiers — and found none. At half past nine on the night of the Solstice festival, the absence was itself a warning. Patches arrived and the group reconvened inside. Cyrrus and Tark enacted a dream spell so the monk could contact his old master Gabbock. The frail prisoner was still alive. Tark swore he would help him and warned him of Zhengyi's return.

Satisfied that the Lich was not materialising in Silverymoon, the group asked Sejuk for contacts in Damara who might be warned. The Dean believed he could reach a friend of a friend and went upstairs to write. The group sent Vernon out for mulled wine and chestnuts.

## Combining the Artefact

In the sitting room, Fëanon said it was time to find out why the two shards of the artefact were attracted to one another. Buumi pulled the fragment from his shield using his prosthetic and tossed it into the centre of the room. Tark opened the bag and held the other piece aloft for a moment.

The shard on the floor shot across the room and slammed into the one in Tark's hand. A deafening roar and a flash of white light. The house shook and everyone dove for cover. Tark was blown through a wall and embedded in another, his body smoking and covered in horrible burns. Arcs of plasma ripped through walls, floors and ceilings as if they were paper. Then, as suddenly as it had started, it ended. The artefact dropped to the floor with a heavy thud — the once solid gold cube now bisected by a straight rectangular streak of obsidian.

Fëanon mage-handed it into his bag of holding. The group hobbled to their feet. Cyrrus rushed to Tark, praying to Selûne and regenerating his wounds. The house groaned and began to shift. They grabbed their things, one another and the injured Sejuk, and fled the crumbling manor into the snowy street where Mr. Pickles waited with the mounts and Gwen. The house collapsed behind them.

Hurt, confused and furious, Sejuk informed them he was done with the group and stormed off to stay with family. Buumi began a prayer of healing while Tark wrapped shadows around them. Guards rushed to the scene as they slipped away.

The group decided they needed to recover before midnight. They made for the House Invincible.

## The Heist

Patches, less injured than the others and thinking ahead, peeled away toward the merchant district. She needed gemstones and could not wait until morning.

She circled the most valuable gem store she could find, scouting defences. An alarm-wire spell protected the back. She scaled a nearby tree, sprinted along a branch and leapt to the roof — the branch snapping through the alarm line and allowing her inside the perimeter. On the roof she found a window, picked the complicated lock, disarmed a trap and slipped into the attic.

Down through the living quarters, past paintings and sculptures, to the showroom. On the second-to-last step she spotted an alarm floorboard, marked it and stepped over. Four display cases awaited: an opal by the street window, a topaz at the counter, a ruby by the far wall and a massive diamond by the stairs.

She went for the topaz first. The case was not trapped but her knife could not scratch it — not glass, but glassteel. She summoned Eclipse and cut noisily through the enchanted material, hunkered down to listen, heard nothing and reached inside to steal the gem's lustre. She turned to the diamond and repeated the process — but this time the blade scraped horribly, throwing sparks. Movement upstairs. Elderly voices swearing about intruders.

Patches leapt to the ceiling and pressed herself into a dark corner. Two robed gnomes rushed downstairs holding wands. When they saw nobody, they began searching. Patches pulled a card from her Deck of Illusions and flicked it to the floor behind them. A roaring troll materialised. The gnomes screamed and bolted into the street.

Patches dropped from the ceiling, finished the cut, pocketed the diamond and sprinted upstairs. Flashes of light erupted outside — the gnomes had dispelled the illusion. She was already on the roof, leaping from tree to rooftop to rooftop, disappearing into the night toward the House Invincible.

## The House Invincible

Arriving at the fortress-cathedral, the wounded group was met by clerics and priests who healed the worst of their injuries. Inside, they were led through massive vaulted archways and stained glass to the chambers of Vigilant Master Thelm — a powerful old man in a rich blue toga, strong despite his age.

Thelm greeted Buumi warmly and listened as the group laid out their evidence: the Ironarms and their patrol routes, the plain-clothes soldiers flooding into the city, the Amnian interest in the artefact and the Illithid, Zhengyi's midnight resurgence and the impending Dwarven treaty. Every thread pointed to an Amnian move at midnight.

Patches rejoined the group, having been led to the meeting. Thelm was convinced — too many coincidences — and ordered mobilisation. Every paladin and cleric would be called to the House for midnight, with a summons sent to the Temple of Lathander as well.

With midnight only ninety minutes away, the group decided against resting and headed for the western city wall — where the Ironarms had their construction contract. It was half past ten.
