Grein Osstyl, embarrassed by the group, turns his fury upon them.

The Metal harness on his chest with the black sourcestone pulses with energy and a Circle of Death spell detonates amidst the party.

He swirls his hands and points, uttering a word and a green flash of light disintegrates the wall of force separating him from his chosen enemies.

The Red Slaad rush in to attack the group at the behest of their master.

The group decides to fight, Patches rushing to each and giving out Poison resistance potions as the Stinking Clouds push through the city.

Everyone else fans out to attack.

Grein is no mere dabbler in the arcane, having studied with Vizeron for decades and outfitted with powerful magical gear, the wizard begins casting.

Lashing out with blasts of necrotic magic, lances of gravity and weaved with defensive spells, Grein immediately puts the group onto the backfoot, having the Slaad tie up Patches and Buumi while Tark tries (in vain) to pin down Grein.

Across the city, Feanon can feel the dark ritual of Vizeron, a lesser version of the ritual he had planned against the Demon Lords.

Feanon can feel it pulling in necrotic energies across the city, feeding on the chaos and death.

Teleporting repeatedly across the battlefield to keep the group guessing, he ends up calling in his last ally as the Death Slaad of Vizeron sneak attacks Tark from stealth.

Across the battlefield, the Slaad begin to fall to the group, leaving Grein without support.

Pinned in the back room and with the FDF converging on him, he tries to throw all of his energies into one last attack.

The group is injured but the attack is cut short as Gundren rounds the corner and unloads his thundercannon into the wizards chest.

Seeing the battle turning, the Death Slaad retreats, Plane shifting away.

As Grein dies, the harness on his body explodes with energy, the Black Sourcestone cracking.

The Harness rapidly shrinks, cuttint into flesh and melding with bone as the flesh is rapidly dissolved from Grein’s body.

He howls in agony as he is transformed and screams “BUT YOU PROMISED!” seemingly to his Master Vizeron.

Feanon can feel the connection between Grein, the harness and Vizeron and recognizes what’s happening.

In his dying moment, Grein pulled on the power of the Harness to try and ascend, to become a lich.  A desperate and stupid move, but maybe his only recource.

Vizeron had foreseen this, and cursed the Harness so in his moment of need, Grein would fail the transformation and become something far more useful to Vizeron; a Boneclaw.

Cirrus tries to capture the thing in a Soul Cage.

Containing it momentarily, Cirrus tries to pull questions from the rapidly corrupting soul of Grein.  He gets confirmation this is Vizeron’s doing and that the ritual was to siphon power for a greater purpose.

Cirrus can hold the Boneclaw no longer and Grein’s soul is twisted beyond repair and ejected from the Soul Cage.

The Undead creature rises from the remains of Grein, the Harness still worn across its chest and lunges toward the group, it’s bony arms extending and stretching weirdly.

Gundren’s helm begins to shine with radiant light, burning the creature but the thing cackles, gathering shadows to itself and then teleporting away, necrotic energy washing over the group.

Helm protects them and they take no damage.

Across the city, the Battle of the Demon Lords ends and the ritual completes.  The Demon Lords are banished and the planar damage beings to repair.

The Abyssal Wild Magic of the Underdark has drained away.

Tark heads to look for the creature, hearing the displacement as it teleported.

Gundren moves in too and as he passes a doorway, an arm lashes out, 15 feet gouging the dwarf badly but finding no purchase.

The group moves in.

They get a number of good hits in before the thing once again teleports away in an explosion of necrotic energies.

The things next ambush is ruined though as Feanon Cone of Colds down the entire hallway forcing it to drop from the ceiling.

The group moves in, cornering it and with their combined efforts, slay the creature and the remaining Slaad in the area.

As the Boneclaw dissolves into ash though, Feanon can clearly feel the essence of the creature being pulled toward Vizeron.

The group re-gathers, Feanon confirming that the Demon Lords are dead and the wild-magic of the Underdark is no longer an issue.

Slamming his staff into the ground and calling upon his place of power on the surface, Feanon recharges his magical stores of energy, draining his reserves on the surface.

The group regathers, Mr. Pickles coming out of the shadows and the group Teleports back to the Barony.


Atop Feanon’s Tower, the group rests.

Taking in the beautiful late spring morning, they look at one another.

No one feels particularly good about how that all ended, and what about the Slaves sent TO the Clawrift?

Unable to do anything about it at present, the group decides to rest and then figure out next steps.

Everyone heads into town, Gundren checking on the ingredients for the Belt and finding everything finally delivered, and Patches checks on Li and the debutant ball.

Li brings up that a strange man appeared in the Keep the other day and after questioning him, they realized the group must have saved him from the Underdark.

Patches confirms and Li says the man - a Hydromancer from the Amnian controlled Moonshae Isles  named **Halrak Sudrin** - is staying in town.

She grabs her package delivered from Sundabar then leaves with Gundren to return to the group in Over the Moon and grab lunch.

As they do, Mr. Pickles informs Patches that Finn, her son is waiting in her rooms.

Patches gifts the group badges from a box, she says that they are badges of Telepathic bonding and she had the commissioned from Megno.

Everyone in the group grabs a badge and they thank Patches, who then goes with Buumi to meet her son.

The entire group follows tentatively.

Patches meets her son in person for the first time in almost two decades.

He thanks her for saving him and Patches introduces Finn to Buumi.

Buumi uses his cleansing touch on the young Drow, dispelling any potential mind controls or dominations.

Patches then calls in the rest of the group, peeking in from the door and introduces Finn, her wizard/sorcerer...brother.

Patches explains that Finn is not her son, long ago, she kidnapped her baby brother from the clutches of her murderous mother.

To hide the kidnapping, Patches faked her own pregnancy and then death during her flight from Menzoberranzan.

From then on, all anyone on the surface would know is that Finn was her son, and to anyone in the Underdark; that Patches and Finn were dead.

Telling the group now, after twenty years is difficult for Patches to admit and most of the group accepts her apology.

Finn nods, lost in thought over the confirmation, having heard similar from his actual mother, Valdalma Faen Tlabbar, but doubting the source.

Finn proclaims that parentage doesn't matter, Patches saved him, twice and he hugs her.

Finn mentions that Valdalma was eager to send him away at the end and he doesnt know why.  This scares him.

Patches nods, keeping it in mind to deal with her mother and her machinations in the future.

This wont be the last time she tangles with House Faen Tlabbar.

Tark hears the truth from patches and is dismayed and saddened by yet another lie.  Nothing but lies, from everyone recently.  He’s having a hard time trusting.

Patches tries to explain again, but Tark is having a hard time accepting it.

Tark leaves the room.

The group moves in, introducing themselves to Finn and welcoming the young Elf to the Barony.

Brother or Son, it doesn't matter to the group, he’s still Patches Family, and they saved him from the City of Spiders.
