**Silverymoon and the Teleport Circle**

Walking away from the Merchant quarter, the group sees an alehouse and decides to duck in to iron out some last minute details.

Inside, they find a small and comfortable pub.  The Place is tended by a lone, floppy haired, jovial man.  They have drinks poured and then sit down.

The group divides up their coin, deciding to deposit 4800 platinum in the vault and keep the rest on themselves.  

The artifact will be going to the vault as well, providing the security is good enough.

They finish up their beers, pay, and head out onto the street.

Tark brings up that this will be the first time in a long while that any of them have not been together, causing the group to reflect on the last year.

Before heading to the Palace Teleportation circle, Fey stops by a General Good's store and orders a large 10-person pavilion to be delivered to Thunder Bluff.

Everything now in order, the group heads to the Palace.

Repairs have gone exceedingly quick, with the worst of the damage already looking significantly better.

Still bustling, the group has no trouble asking for directions and quickly find themselves in a section of the Palace they had not previously seen.

Approaching a set of Golden doors within a black marble Archway, the group is stopped by two ornately equipped guards, their faces invisible beneath full helmets.

The guards disallow entry to the Teleport ring, that is until Cirrus confirms his identity as the new Baronett and shows them his writ of Title.

The guards bow and the doors swing open, revealing a hemispherical marble chamber, with a silver ring in the center covered in softly glowing runes.

As the group enters the chamber, they notice a small Gnome sitting in a high chair, a massive book resting on a small table in front of her.

The old Gnomish woman greets the group with a large smile and asks the destination.

The group says Sundabar, and the Gnome holds out her hand for payment.

Taken aback, the group inquires about the price, and when they discover it's 5 Platinum, per person, they make their shock very clear.

Inquiring further, they discover that the Mages of the world have a monopoly on Teleportation circles and charge hefty sums for their use.

Unwilling to pay, the group leaves, heading toward the North-west gate to perform their own Teleport.

Arriving just out of the gate, it takes Fey a moment to find some flat ground that will take his magical chalk and goes about inscribing the circle.

The air distorts within the circle of runes, warping light and space and stretching it into a tiny black dot in the center.

Buumi looks a little apprehensive, but is quickly shoved into it with a laugh from the rest of the group.

Patches and Gundren (with Gwen) follow, with Megno having taken his own teleport earlier in the day to get a head start deciphering the book.

The rest of the group of Fey, Cirrus and Tark, including Aurora, Kitty and Mr. Pickles (now being given the first name of 'Dill'), mount up.

They begin heading North-west along the snowy Trade Way.

**Sundabar and the Bank**

​The other side of the teleport is identical to the room in Silverymoon Palace, with one notable exception, being a Dwarf at a desk and not a Gnome.

Patches, Buumi, Gundren and Gwen on the Tenser's Disk, all walk to the exit, but the doors don't budge.

The seated Dwarf adjusts his spectacles and greets the group, holding out his hand for payment.

Sighing, Buumi pulls out 1pp per traveler (receiving is cheaper than sending) and pays.

The Dwarf thanks them and the doors swing open, the heat of the Undercity and the Everfire immediately assaulting them.

The small group leaves the Teleportation chamber, past several heavily armed guards and finds themselves in the Everfire chamber, in the heart of the Dwarven Undercity of Sundabar.

Not wishing to waste any time, the group quickly gets their bearings and head off toward Megno's workshop, in the main ring around the pool of magma at the heart of the chamber.

The group sees many of the armored Dwarves skimming metals from the surface of the pool.

After a short walk, the group arrives at Megno's workshop and knocks. 

The door swings wide a moment later and a grinning, bruised Megno greets them and invites them in.

Though still recovering from his injuries from the previous day, despite clerical help, Megno animatedly begins telling them what he's found in the book.

It's slow going, but the Ancient Delzoun writing reveals the existence of an important structure...and that's as far as he's gotten.  

He expects at least three days of work ahead of him, maybe more.

As the group looks about the workshop, they see several half constructed prototypes and gadgets.  Investigating, Gundren sees attempts to replicate his own artificing work.

Gundren begins to get angry, until he notes that none of it is working, or quite right.  

Assured that his work is still superior, he and Megno have a good laugh, sharing in some well natured (for now) competition.

Gundren asks to use Megno's workshop to repair Gwen and the Enchanter agrees, letting Gundren use whatever he needs, as long as he replaces what's used.

Patches and Buumi then let Megno know of their intent to use the Clan Vaults to store their treasures. 

Megno thinks it's a great idea and offers to introduce them to the Dwarves in charge.

The group readily agrees and they head out from the workshop, Megno dressed in splendid red robes.

Heading north, they move through the Military training ward. 

Many Dwarves are bustling around, but just as many are drinking and enjoying the early evening.

With Megno leading them, the group makes it to the Clan Vaults un-accosted.

The doors to the vault give them pause though, standing thirty feet and made of pure Adamantite, the exterior gate is guarded by a half dozen Dwarves in full plate armor.

Through the open doors, a large vaulted chamber can be seen, the area bustling with activity as Dwarves, and the occasional Human, can be seen going about their business.

Megno, Patches and Buumi head inside.

Looking around the large chamber, the group sees a busy bank, with tellers set up on the right hand side behind an ornate Mithril barrier, with a velvet roped line leading away.  

To the left are a series of desks, each one attended to by an older Dwarf with a pair of plush leather chairs set up in front of each.

At the back of the chamber is a small tunnel, barely 5ft tall and wide, a slab of Adamantite acting as a door (currently open).

In front of the small tunnel, are another half dozen plate clad guards.

Looking around the chamber, many more guards can be seen patrolling.  This place is a fortress.

Megno get's the attention of a young page, with barely a whisker on him, the young Dwarf turns to help the group.

Once the scale of the deposit is revealed, the young Dwarf leads the group away from the tellers at the counters, past many desks and to the side of the large chamber, where a series of ornate wooden doors are cut into the perfectly smooth-worked stone.

Knocking on the door, a moment later, it swings open and the group enters the office.

Sitting behind a rich wooden desk and seated at an ornate chair is an elderly Dwarf with frizzy white hair, Ruby (literal) spectacles and a shimmering Golden robe.

He rises to his feet with a smile and introduces himself as Darrak Goldhold, Vaultkeeper.

Megno introduces the group, shakes Darrak's hand and then leaves to continue his work deciphering the Book.

Now alone, the group takes in the rest of the office, noting hundreds of black marble shelves, divided into small "boxes" maybe three or four inches wide and numbered with runes.

Talking with Darrak, the group asks many questions about the security of the vault and while Darrak is tight lipped about specifics, he does let some things slip:

The vaults are guarded by dozens of the best equipped guards in the city.

The jobs here are for life, no one can just come in and work for security reasons.

The main vault has an Iron Golem.

The tunnel leading in is the only way in or out of the vaults and guards are posted every 10 ft.

Every surface, from the tunnel through to the vaults themselves are protected by Glyphs and Symbols enacted by two Abjurers whose sole duty it is to defend the vaults.

The Southern Vault is currently having their wards and security updated as a new Vaultkeeper has been promoted when the last one died of old age.

The vault the group is getting is a pocket dimensional space, roughly four times the size of a bag of holding (40 cubic feet), located with the more prominent vaults.

The group gets a wand of depositing, attuning to 1 person (only) and usable once per day to transport any loose, non-magical material into the vault from anywhere on the prime material plane.

The shelves behind Darrak are the boxes the wands come in, he takes one black marble box from the shelf and hands it to the group.

The group also gets a leather-bound cheque book that's recognised as far south as Waterdeep and as far east as The Moonsea.

The group asks for a quick tour and Darrak is happy to oblige, more than willing to show off his Bank.

Taking the group around the main chamber, he stops by the small tunnel out to the vaults and the group looks down it, seeing (although barely) small alcoves every 10ft.

Darrak jovially asks if they would like to see the last thief that managed to get inside the vault.

Curious, Patches and Buumi agree and Darrak takes them back to his office.

Once there, he unlocks a drawer and pulls out the remains of the thief; a desiccated pinkie finger, and begins chuckling that after the Iron Golem was finished, this was all that was left.

Buumi and Patches thank Darrak, leaving the coin with him (keeping enough for day to day spending), but take The Artifact with them, wanting to check in with the group before leaving it at their vault.

Leaving the bank, Patches remarks that she does not think she can infiltrate this Vault, not without magical assistance.

Buumi agrees and mentions dinner, offering that he saw a Waterdhavian Tapas place on the way over from the Everfire.

Patches, distracted and still thinking about the vault, agrees and they head off to grab some dinner.

**The Road**

Cirrus, Fey, Tark, Mr. Pickles and the Cats all head out North West along the snowy Trade Way.

The First day goes by without incident, the road getting snowier and snowier the further they head from Silverymoon.

The rolling planes and hills are quite beautiful covered in glittering snow, the occasional copse of trees rising up from the landscape and lit by the clear winter sky.

As the sun sets on the first day, the group pulls off the side of the road and Cirrus pulls a book out, seemingly from nowhere and begins to read out an incantation.

A minute later, a perfectly hemispherical, white dome appears in front of the party, large enough to hold everyone.

Cirrus walks forward and simply disappears, passing through the opaque surface, the group follows moments later and finds themselves inside the "Tiny Hut".

Plush rugs cover the ground and no snow can be seen inside.

The interior is a pleasant temperature and from the inside, the walls of the dome are translucent.

The group settles in for the evening, breaking out rations and chatting about recent events.

Unsatisfied by rations, Fey summons an Azer to go out and try and scrounge some tubers, but the fiery Dwarf returns empty handed after many hours of searching.

Both Cats go out and about, playing in the snow and generally being giant cats.

Eventually, a lazy snowfall begins and the group settles in to sleep.

The next morning, the group awakens to an overcast day and begin to go about their morning routine.

Only Fey leaves the Dome though before the spell expires and dumps the night's accumulation of snow on those still inside.

Quickly cleaning themselves off, the group mounts up and continues on their way, the landscape slowly becoming woodier and hillier.

The second day moves along relatively uneventfully, pushing through new snowfall, the summoned mounts clear the way with the Cats following behind.

The tranquility of the days travel is suddenly shattered though, as a massive chitinous form bursts from the snow, knocking Fey from his mount.

Moments later, two more massive beetles leap from the snow, ambushing the party.

Fey manages to release a spell, dazing his attacker and managing to wiggle free of it's monstrous maw.

Tark quickly leaps at one of the beasts, cracking it's chitin with precise strikes while the Cats flank and tag team the third, with Mr. Pickles shooting it with his flintlocks.

Tark Dispatches his and turns to the last, just in time to see Cirrus splatter it with a volley of Eldritch Blasts.

Only the dazed beetle remains and the group surrounds it and attacks it in unison, obliterating it.

Inspecting the corpses, Fey recognises them as Ankheg Beetles and the group collects some pieces of their valuable Chitin.

They also take some of the meat for dinner and after taking a moment to collect themselves, begin heading off again.

As the sun sets once more, the group repeats the process of raising the Dome and bedding down for the evening, dining on the Ankheg meat.

Having learned from the previous morning, the whole group vacates the Dome before the spell ends and they head off along the road once more, eager to make the Barony before mid-day.

**The Barony**

Fey, Cirrus, Tark, Dill Pickles and the Cats all descend into a slight valley, the river Rauvin to the south and the Moonwood rising on the hills to the North.

Still to the west rises a large bluff maybe 1000ft high and overlooking the river, thunderous rapids echoing off it's cliff sides.

Further in the distance, the grey expanse of the Evermoor extends across the horizon, strangely desaturated in the winter cold.

The Barony is expansive and well forested, with heavy snowfall covering the area several feet deep.

Off in the distance, walking along the slight dip in the snow that marks the road, the group sees a figure walking towards them.  The shape of a large dog is evident by its side.

The group approaches the figure and it calls out to them, revealing itself to be an old woman.

The old woman greets the group and begins asking them questions of their business and the group asks her in turn.

After a minute, the old lady realizes the group is trustworthy enough and stands up straight, revealing herself to be not as old and decrepit as she looked.

Pulling back her hood, pointed ears reveal her to be an old half-elf, a ranger by the name of **Moogie**.  Her Wolf-Hound's name is Charles.

The group begins walking with Moogie, who gives them a map of the area and a brief overview of the lands.

Thunder Bluff and the ruined castle of High-Hold, known to the locals as Moorwatch.  Destroyed two years ago by the Orcish Horde.

Kossenberg, north of the road and nestled at the base of the forest.

Old Kossenberg, the ruins of the town at the base of the Bluff, destroyed two years ago by the Orcish Horde.

Lake Seluna and the Ranger Lodge.  The lake being named for the beautiful view of the moon in springtime above the Moonwood.

The Red Hill, named for its red soil and rock containing good Iron deposits.

Other landmarks not asked about were:

Oldstone, a sacred Menhir, older than local memory.

The Glittering Caves beneath The Red Hill.

The group asks about the ruined castle and Moogie mentions that she knows that someone, or something is currently living in the ruins.

Wanting to check the ruins out before the village, the group is led to the road up the Bluff by Moogie.

Ascending the switchbacks on the snowy road, the group approaches the ruined front gates of the Hold.  The group spies movement and comes to a halt.

A low, gutteral voice barks out in Orcish and Mr.Pickles translates into Common.

A Tribe of Orcs has moved into the ruins, deserters of the Horde from two years ago, they fled the war and hid in the swamp.

They lost many in the Evermoors and eventually settled into the caves beneath the Bluff, waiting out the war.

After the war ended, the tribe remained and prospered for a time.  Until the Undead mists began a year ago.

One night, a mighty and insubstantial Troll found their caves and assaulted them.  The orcs were driven out by the monstrosity they named Shadowclaw.

Fleeing up the Bluff, the Orcs then settled in the Ruins for the onset of winter.  With wounded and with the ruins haunted, the Orcs are barely surviving.

The group heads into the ruins, gaining enough of the Tribes trust, the Tribe realizing that the group means them no harm and may in fact help them.

Cirrus speaks with their leader: **Luumsh, **and informs him of the new political situation of the area.

Thinking he is being ousted from his home, Luumsh and the tribe begin to become agitated until Cirrus makes it very clear that if anything, the opposite is true.

Cirrus and the group are looking for citizens, people to live in the Barony and work the land and in exchange, the group will ensure their safety and prosperity.

Unsure, Luumsh asks his fellows, including a little old Lady-Orc named **Keek;** Shaman of of Luthic.

Keek had come out to meet the group and had begun cooking with the leftover Ankheg meat, discussing the current state of the Tribe.

After a moment of discussing it, the tribe puts forth a proposition; that the group show their strength and remove Shadowclaw from the Caverns.

Knowing they would have to do this anyway, the group agrees, offering the Orcs the settlement of Old Kossenberg when the deed is done.

Skeptical, the Orcs agree and the group turns to head down the Bluff to the Caverns.

Moogie offers to show them to the Caves and remarks that she is happy with how the exchange went down, that before the war was a century of peaceful coexistence with the Orcs.

She knows that they are just people and there are good and bad.  

She thinks this tribe might be good for the region and hopes the people in Kossenberg will accept Orcs living on the ashes of their old homes...
