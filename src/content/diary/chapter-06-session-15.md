## The Teleportation Tax

Walking away from the merchant quarter, the group ducked into a small alehouse to divide their coin. They set aside forty-eight hundred platinum for the vault, with the artefact to follow if the security proved adequate. They finished their beers, paid and headed for the Palace.

At the teleportation chamber — a hemispherical marble room with a silver ring of softly glowing runes — a small gnome in a high chair held out her hand for payment. Five platinum per person. The group made their outrage very clear. Learning that the mages of the world held a monopoly on teleportation circles and charged accordingly, they refused to pay and left for the north-west gate.

Outside the city, Fëanon found flat ground, inscribed his circle and activated it. The air warped within the runes, stretching light and space into a tiny black dot. Buumi looked apprehensive and was promptly shoved in by the others. Patches and Gundren — with Gwen on her floating disc — followed. Megno had taken his own teleport earlier to get a head start on the Dwarven journal.

The remaining group — Fëanon, Cyrrus and Tark, with Aurora, Kitty and Mr. Pickles (now given the first name Dill) — mounted up and headed north-west along the snowy Tradeway.

## The Sundabar Vaults

The teleport deposited the others in the Everfire chamber. After paying the receiving fee — one platinum per head, at least cheaper than sending — they made for Megno's workshop. The enchanter greeted them with a bruised grin, still recovering from the battle. He had begun translating the ancient Delzoun writing and found reference to an important structure, but had at least three days' work ahead.

Gundren spotted half-finished attempts to replicate his own artificing work among Megno's prototypes and began to seethe — until he noticed that none of it actually worked. Both dwarves laughed and settled into a companionable rivalry. Gundren asked to use the workshop to repair Gwen and Megno agreed.

Patches and Buumi told Megno of their intent to use the Clan Vaults. The enchanter introduced them to the right people and the trio made for the Northern Vaults — past thirty-foot adamantite doors flanked by half a dozen guards in full plate. Inside, a busy bank spread before them: tellers behind an ornate mithril barrier on the right, desks attended by elderly dwarves on the left, and at the back a five-foot tunnel of adamantite leading deeper, guarded by another half dozen warriors.

They were led to the office of Darrak Goldhold, Vaultkeeper — an elderly dwarf with frizzy white hair, literal ruby spectacles and a shimmering golden robe. Darrak laid out the security: dozens of the best-equipped guards in the city, lifetime employment for all vault staff, an Iron Golem in the main vault, guards posted every ten feet in the tunnel, and every surface protected by glyphs enacted by two dedicated abjurers. The group's vault would be a pocket-dimensional space roughly four times the size of a bag of holding. They received a wand of depositing — attuned to one person, usable once per day to transport non-magical material from anywhere on the prime material plane — and a leather-bound cheque book recognised as far south as Waterdeep and as far east as the Moonsea.

Darrak offered a tour and jovially asked if they would like to see the last thief who had made it inside. He unlocked a drawer and produced a desiccated pinkie finger — all the Iron Golem had left. Patches and Buumi deposited the coin but took the artefact with them, wanting to consult the group first.

Leaving the bank, Patches remarked that she could not infiltrate this vault — not without magical help. Buumi agreed and suggested dinner. He had noticed a Waterdhavian tapas place on the way from the Everfire.

## The Road to Thunder Bluff

Cyrrus, Fëanon, Tark, Dill Pickles and the cats headed north-west along the snowy Tradeway. The first day passed without incident — rolling plains and hills glittering under a clear winter sky, the occasional copse of trees rising from the white landscape. At sunset, Cyrrus read an incantation from his new scroll and a perfectly hemispherical white dome appeared. Inside, plush rugs covered the ground and the walls were translucent from within. The temperature was pleasant. They settled in with rations — though Fëanon summoned an Azer to forage tubers, the fiery dwarf returned empty-handed. The cats played in the snow outside before everyone slept.

The next morning, Fëanon was the only one to leave the dome before the spell expired, dumping the night's snow accumulation on those still inside. The second day grew woodier and hillier. That afternoon, a massive chitinous form burst from the snow and knocked Fëanon from his mount. Two more Ankheg beetles ambushed the party. Tark cracked one's carapace with precise strikes, the cats flanked and tore into the third while Mr. Pickles fired his flintlocks, and Cyrrus splattered the last with Eldritch Blasts. They collected valuable chitin and beetle meat for dinner.

On the third morning, the group descended into a slight valley — the river Rauvin to the south, the Moonwood rising on the hills to the north. To the west rose Thunder Bluff itself, a thousand-foot cliff overlooking the river, the thunder of rapids echoing off its sides. Beyond it, the grey expanse of the Evermoor stretched across the horizon.

## Moogie

Walking along the road, they spotted a figure approaching with a large dog at its side. An old woman called out to them. After a minute of conversation, she straightened up — not nearly as old or decrepit as she appeared. Pointed ears emerged from beneath her hood. Moogie was a half-elf ranger, and her wolfhound's name was Charles.

She gave the group a map and a brief survey of the barony: Thunder Bluff and the ruined castle of High Hold — known locally as Moorwatch — destroyed two years ago by the Orcish Horde. The village of Kossenberg, nestled at the base of the Moonwood. Old Kossenberg, the ruins of the original settlement at the base of the bluff, also destroyed. Lake Selûna and its ranger lodge, named for the view of the moon above the Moonwood in springtime. The Red Hill, with its iron deposits and the Glittering Caves beneath. And Oldstone, a sacred menhir older than local memory.

The group asked about the ruined castle. Moogie mentioned that something — or someone — was living in the ruins.

## The Orcs of High Hold

Moogie led them up the switchback road to the ruined front gates. They spied movement and halted. A low, guttural voice barked out in Orcish and Mr. Pickles translated.

A tribe of orcs had moved in — deserters from the Horde who had fled the war and hidden in the Evermoors, losing many before settling in caves beneath the bluff. After the war ended they prospered for a time, until undead mists began a year ago. One night, a mighty spirit troll they named Shadowclaw found their caves and drove them out. The tribe had retreated to the ruins for winter, wounded and haunted, barely surviving.

The group entered the ruins and gained enough trust for Cyrrus to speak with their leader, Luumsh. When the orc feared he was being ousted, the group made the opposite clear: they were looking for citizens — people to live in the barony, work the land, and in exchange receive safety and prosperity.

Luumsh consulted his fellows, including a little old lady-orc named Keek, the shaman of Luthic, who had already begun cooking with the leftover Ankheg meat. After deliberation, the tribe put forth a proposition: prove your strength by removing Shadowclaw from the caverns. The group agreed, offering the orcs the settlement of Old Kossenberg when the deed was done. The orcs accepted.

Moogie remarked that she was happy with how things went — that before the war there had been a century of peaceful coexistence with the orcs. She knew there were good and bad among them and thought this tribe might be good for the region. She hoped the people of Kossenberg would accept orcs living on the ashes of their old homes.
